WEBVTT

00:06.980 --> 00:10.560
Did we really need to bother 
with all this, Mr. Dongsuk?

00:10.560 --> 00:12.740
We could've just killed them.

00:13.450 --> 00:15.350
What are you, dense?

00:15.350 --> 00:19.210
We fight in there, and the spider 
wakes up? No more mana crystals.

00:19.630 --> 00:22.560
I don't care if he's the 
weakest or the bleakest,

00:22.560 --> 00:25.810
there's no way that wimpy piece of crap 
and a D-Rank with no raid experience

00:25.810 --> 00:27.420
can take a boss down.

00:27.420 --> 00:32.420
The spider eats them, it goes back to sleep, 
and then we haul out the mana crystals.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.180
Should I light the place up with magic again?

00:35.180 --> 00:37.760
That would also wake the spider up!

00:39.620 --> 00:43.630
There were side tunnels near the ceiling. 
That's where we'll drop back down.

00:44.190 --> 00:47.730
I get it. Nice plan, Mr. Dongsuk.

00:47.730 --> 00:49.580
You think it'll be asleep, though?

00:49.580 --> 00:52.910
If not, we'll have to take 
the boss down ourselves.

00:52.910 --> 00:56.960
Though, that Yoo Jinho kid... 
You saw his gear, right?

00:56.960 --> 00:59.730
The sword and shield alone must 
be worth hundreds of millions.

00:59.730 --> 01:03.920
If we can't grab enough mana crystals, 
his stuff will have to do.

01:04.470 --> 01:07.520
Better find out whose trust fund kid he is.

01:07.520 --> 01:10.200
It'd look bad if I didn't show at the funeral.

01:10.200 --> 01:14.590
Gotta say, that was a hell of a noise 
when the entrance caved in.

01:14.590 --> 01:17.140
The boss has gotta be pissed.

01:17.750 --> 01:21.980
Kyuhwan, do you think you could take 
that nasty bastard down yourself?

01:21.980 --> 01:24.750
Not at all!

01:24.750 --> 01:29.190
I'm right there with you. 
It was a pretty impressive boss.

01:31.210 --> 01:37.540
Which means those two little twerps 
have absolutely no chance of surviving.

01:38.090 --> 01:42.240
Hang on! You'd need to be at least B-Rank 
to take down a C-Rank boss by yourself.

01:42.240 --> 01:45.440
Or an upper C-Rank, at the very minimum!

01:45.440 --> 01:47.140
You've got no chance, Jinwoo...

01:48.340 --> 01:50.260
Let's try and find a way out instead!

01:51.120 --> 01:57.970
<i>Jinho is right. I may have reawakened 
and leveled up, but I'm still weak.</i>

01:58.900 --> 02:03.980
<i>The Blue Venom-Fanged Kasaka I ran into 
in the instance dungeon was probably D-Rank,</i>

02:04.950 --> 02:07.820
<i>and that golem boss was 
probably D-Rank or lower.</i>

02:09.360 --> 02:14.000
<i>This boss is guaranteed to be 
a lot stronger than either of them.</i>

02:15.130 --> 02:20.040
<i>But for some reason... I don't feel
intimidated enough to give up.</i>

02:21.040 --> 02:25.670
<i>I've gotten strong enough to stand 
my ground against a C-Rank boss.</i>

02:27.310 --> 02:29.340
<i>I'm level 18 now.</i>

02:31.790 --> 02:33.590
<i>Taking on a C-Rank boss...</i>

02:35.820 --> 02:37.260
<i>is worth a shot!</i>

02:42.170 --> 02:44.890
<i>We're called hunters for a reason.</i>

02:46.090 --> 02:48.680
<i>And the real hunt begins now!</i>

04:28.250 --> 04:29.680
Another long day, sir.

04:30.540 --> 04:32.960
The government, the media,

04:32.960 --> 04:34.980
organizations related to energy development...

04:34.980 --> 04:38.470
These nonstop meetings 
are beginning to wear on me.

04:39.250 --> 04:42.910
I was never much of a talker 
in the first place.

04:46.610 --> 04:49.780
Your schedule is clear for the time being.

04:50.310 --> 04:54.190
Would it be all right if I asked 
for a bit of instruction?

04:54.550 --> 04:57.400
It might be the change of pace you need, too.

05:00.350 --> 05:02.920
They say old soldiers fade away...

05:03.390 --> 05:07.480
but I can hardly turn down a youngster 
asking for a spot of guidance.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.460
<i>Its exoskeleton is so hard!</i>

05:22.150 --> 05:25.510
<i>And it strikes with tremendous power! 
One false move, and I'm dead!</i>

05:32.070 --> 05:35.440
The way he's moving... No way is he E-Rank!

05:35.800 --> 05:38.150
Wh-What in the world is he?!

05:39.730 --> 05:42.490
Wait... Did he fake his ranking?!

05:42.970 --> 05:44.750
<i>I've heard the rumors.</i>

05:44.750 --> 05:49.390
<i>Rare individuals can control their magic 
power to register with a lower ranking—</i>

05:49.390 --> 05:52.200
<i>the hunters known as false rankers!</i>

05:52.860 --> 05:57.700
<i>And most of them are said to be 
lunatics who kill for the fun of it!</i>

06:00.830 --> 06:03.650
What am I doing here?

06:03.650 --> 06:05.620
D-Dad...

06:11.260 --> 06:14.610
<i>Damn! Its exterior is too tough 
for me to do any real damage!</i>

06:16.030 --> 06:19.650
<i>And if my fatigue gets any higher, 
I'll start to slow down.</i>

06:20.330 --> 06:22.610
<i>I need to kill it before that happens!</i>

06:23.580 --> 06:28.030
<i>Paralysis and drain... This dagger's 
special abilities will be the key!</i>

06:28.450 --> 06:30.490
<i>If I aim for a weak spot, 
it should get through!</i>

06:30.490 --> 06:31.700
<i>There!</i>

06:37.150 --> 06:40.460
<i>Acid?! That's a nasty surprise!</i>

06:41.270 --> 06:43.130
<i>Rock-solid armor and acidic spit...</i>

06:43.130 --> 06:45.680
<i>This eight-legged freak 
is even worse than I thought.</i>

06:46.500 --> 06:48.890
<i>And the longer this goes on, 
the worse off I'll be.</i>

06:49.780 --> 06:52.810
<i>I need to get up close, 
regardless of the risk.</i>

06:53.410 --> 06:55.150
<i>My new skill, Dash...</i>

06:55.830 --> 06:58.400
<i>I can use this to get in, fast!</i>

07:11.870 --> 07:16.100
<i>If one hit won't cut it, then I'll keep going!</i>

07:17.750 --> 07:19.590
<i>S-So fast...</i>

07:19.900 --> 07:22.130
<i>But will he have enough 
stamina to hang in there?</i>

07:22.990 --> 07:24.800
<i>What is he even trying to do?</i>

07:27.180 --> 07:28.470
<i>Faster...</i>

07:30.230 --> 07:31.880
<i>I have to go faster!</i>

07:34.030 --> 07:35.810
<i>Almost there!</i>

07:40.870 --> 07:41.930
Jinwoo!

08:00.180 --> 08:01.290
Jinwoo!

08:46.780 --> 08:51.560
<i>It's a good thing I sat on 
those daily quest rewards.</i>

08:52.260 --> 08:54.480
<i>I would've had more trouble otherwise.</i>

08:56.800 --> 08:58.730
<i>I can't believe it...</i>

08:58.730 --> 09:01.310
<i>He really did beat a boss by himself!</i>

09:02.590 --> 09:07.110
<i>And there can be no other explanation! 
He's a false ranker!</i>

09:07.830 --> 09:10.540
I wonder how much this'll go for...

09:11.070 --> 09:14.070
U-Um... B-Boss?

09:14.780 --> 09:18.020
Would you like me to carry 
the essence stone for you?

09:18.020 --> 09:20.710
I'll handle the gear, too.

09:21.070 --> 09:24.650
Here's some water. 
Please help yourself, Boss.

09:24.650 --> 09:26.140
U-Uh... Sure.

09:26.780 --> 09:28.460
<i>Why is he calling me that?</i>

09:28.810 --> 09:33.360
You rest up, boss! 
I'll excavate the mana crystals!

09:34.810 --> 09:37.410
<i>What the heck's gotten into him?</i>

09:39.560 --> 09:41.480
Huh... They're alive.

10:01.670 --> 10:03.230
Are you all right?

10:03.230 --> 10:06.210
Yes, sir. Thank you for the lesson.

10:06.550 --> 10:09.560
I should be thanking you. 
This really was just what I needed.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.420
I appreciate it.

10:11.840 --> 10:15.610
I'm impressed, Chairman. 
You don't seem to have lost a step.

10:15.610 --> 10:19.390
No, compared to when I was on active duty...

10:20.070 --> 10:23.230
You've gotten better 
at defense yourself, Jinchul.

10:23.230 --> 10:25.130
It shows you've kept up your practice.

10:25.130 --> 10:27.140
Training might not raise your rank,

10:27.140 --> 10:30.730
but you can always hone 
your body and technique.

10:32.110 --> 10:34.350
It's important to work 
on one's body and mind,

10:34.350 --> 10:37.190
instead of relying solely 
on your hunter powers.

10:37.190 --> 10:41.060
Especially if you regularly find yourself 
in extreme situations like dungeons.

10:41.730 --> 10:48.090
It's at times like those when human nature 
can rear its ugly head.

10:48.590 --> 10:50.390
Is the freaking boss dead?

10:50.390 --> 10:53.800
I guess it was just an overgrown spider? 
What a joke.

10:53.800 --> 10:57.570
Maybe that gear was enough 
to beat a C-Rank boss with.

10:57.570 --> 11:01.520
But in the hands of a D-Rank... 
Just how weak was this thing?

11:01.520 --> 11:04.000
What's the call, Mr. Dongsuk?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.730
Ain't it obvious?

11:05.730 --> 11:07.080
Yoo Jinho!

11:07.830 --> 11:11.780
That fancy gear of yours got me curious, 
and I'm impressed!

11:12.160 --> 11:17.070
Your old man's Yoo Myunghan, 
the head of Yoojin Construction, right?

11:17.960 --> 11:19.930
Wh-What of it?

11:19.930 --> 11:21.880
I'm giving you a chance!

11:22.370 --> 11:24.330
Kill Sung Jinwoo.

11:26.050 --> 11:27.910
You've figured it out by now, right?

11:27.910 --> 11:33.130
We pick up wastes of space to round out our 
numbers, let them die, and keep all the loot.

11:33.130 --> 11:36.610
Jinho. You're gonna be an accomplice.

11:36.610 --> 11:38.590
That's the only way you're walking out alive.

11:38.590 --> 11:40.010
That's...

11:40.370 --> 11:44.520
<i>That trust fund kid's gear was 
enough to take down a C-Rank...</i>

11:44.520 --> 11:46.630
<i>If it has special effects, 
it could be a real pain.</i>

11:47.280 --> 11:51.020
Or if you'd prefer, you can both die here.

11:52.140 --> 11:55.210
What's up? Why hesitate?

11:55.210 --> 11:58.160
Nothing that happens here 
is ever going to get out, anyway.

11:58.160 --> 12:01.960
Don't tell me a D-Rank like you 
is afraid of an E-Rank like him...

12:21.000 --> 12:24.680
So you're siding with him?

12:27.910 --> 12:30.150
What now, Mr. Dongsuk?

12:30.150 --> 12:31.970
Deal with the weak one first.

12:32.840 --> 12:34.040
Have you boys...

12:34.800 --> 12:38.150
ever killed a human before?

12:42.950 --> 12:44.530
<i>An urgent quest?</i>

12:45.040 --> 12:46.680
<i>What the hell?</i>

12:47.410 --> 12:50.670
You're gonna wanna pay attention!

12:58.290 --> 12:59.400
Boss!

13:05.140 --> 13:06.460
Heejin!

13:09.850 --> 13:11.810
It's been a while.

13:11.810 --> 13:14.800
How have things been with 
the White Tiger Guild lately?

13:14.800 --> 13:17.930
Nothing special, really. 
Just the usual business.

13:17.930 --> 13:20.120
What about the Hunters Guild, Gina?

13:20.120 --> 13:22.880
Same for us, really. Just normal stuff.

13:23.280 --> 13:28.270
You mentioned you were going to start 
A-Rank dungeon training with Ms. Cha.

13:28.270 --> 13:29.750
How'd that go?

13:29.750 --> 13:31.420
It was really something...

13:31.420 --> 13:32.920
Something fast.

13:33.360 --> 13:36.640
We were all struggling against 
an A-Rank beast...

13:41.430 --> 13:43.390
But she defeated it in a flash.

13:44.390 --> 13:47.220
She made it look extremely easy.

13:47.220 --> 13:52.180
We were all pretty surprised, 
but Kihoon was completely bowled over.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.420
He'd been hoping to become the next 
strike team captain, you see.

13:56.420 --> 13:58.330
He is pretty straight-laced, yeah.

13:58.330 --> 14:00.510
What about Chul in your guild?

14:00.510 --> 14:03.250
He's after the same kind of position, right?

14:03.590 --> 14:06.140
He's... not a bad guy or anything...

14:06.140 --> 14:08.980
The fact that you said it 
like that tells us everything.

14:09.410 --> 14:12.870
Well, be that as it may, we're pretty lucky.

14:12.870 --> 14:17.360
The Hunters Guild and the White Tiger Guild...
We're in the big leagues.

14:17.360 --> 14:18.810
You've got a point there.

14:19.840 --> 14:24.310
You hear plenty of unsavory rumors 
about a lot of places out there.

14:24.670 --> 14:26.250
Like what?

14:26.760 --> 14:31.010
Strike teams with suspiciously 
high fatality rates, for instance.

14:34.350 --> 14:37.190
Yoo Jinho! He's dead.

14:39.030 --> 14:40.440
How could you?!

14:43.000 --> 14:45.120
<i>How could I have forgotten?</i>

14:45.780 --> 14:49.030
<i>I work in a world where survival 
of the fittest is the reality.</i>

14:49.590 --> 14:53.200
<i>A world filled with violence, 
deception, and betrayal.</i>

14:54.120 --> 14:55.400
<i>How could I...?</i>

14:55.880 --> 14:58.710
<i>How? How? How...?</i>

14:58.710 --> 15:04.510
<i>How? How? How? How?! How?!</i>

15:05.680 --> 15:08.680
<i>That's it. I'd grown numb to it.</i>

15:09.420 --> 15:13.570
<i>Carelessness. Overconfidence. Delusion.</i>

15:16.070 --> 15:17.440
<i>Enemies...</i>

15:17.810 --> 15:21.300
<i>The system is telling me to kill.</i>

15:22.470 --> 15:25.040
<i>Does it need to keep me alive 
for some reason?</i>

15:26.590 --> 15:29.250
<i>This isn't a coincidence. It's not charity.</i>

15:30.560 --> 15:33.400
<i>The system wants me alive.</i>

15:37.870 --> 15:39.720
<i>It wants me strong.</i>

15:40.890 --> 15:42.750
Boss! Thank goodness...

15:43.030 --> 15:45.580
Dude, he's alive.

15:47.470 --> 15:49.160
Okay, then.

15:51.010 --> 15:56.400
If the system wants to use me, 
then I'll use it, too.

15:56.980 --> 15:59.790
Damn it, Kyuhwan. Don't hold back so much.

16:01.440 --> 16:02.970
I'd forgotten.

16:03.400 --> 16:07.610
The weak always get taken from. 
That's how it works here.

16:07.610 --> 16:12.030
Hey, look! The Weakest Hunter 
of All Mankind actually gets it!

16:12.630 --> 16:17.320
That means you guys understand 
how it works, too, right?

16:17.830 --> 16:20.280
How what works?

16:20.280 --> 16:22.460
If you're hunters...

16:23.750 --> 16:27.840
then you're ready to be 
preyed on yourselves, right?

16:29.300 --> 16:32.010
Let me handle this, Mr. Dongsuk.

16:32.010 --> 16:36.470
Look, buddy. You clearly don't 
understand what's going on here.

16:36.900 --> 16:38.970
We should be ready to be preyed on?

16:38.970 --> 16:42.470
And what's a jumped-up 
E-Rank like you gonna do?

16:42.470 --> 16:44.690
The Weakest Hunter of All—

16:57.130 --> 16:58.310
One down.

16:58.310 --> 16:59.850
J-Juntae!

16:59.850 --> 17:01.000
What the hell?

17:01.000 --> 17:02.790
When did he draw that weapon?!

17:02.790 --> 17:04.960
Where was he even hiding it?!

17:04.960 --> 17:07.610
<i>Overconfidence aside, Juntae was D-Rank!</i>

17:07.960 --> 17:10.200
<i>How could an E-Rank manage to kill him?!</i>

17:13.430 --> 17:15.720
<i>I just killed someone.</i>

17:16.070 --> 17:17.280
<i>A human being.</i>

17:17.930 --> 17:20.810
<i>Even if I was just obeying the system,</i>

17:21.480 --> 17:25.480
<i>I've... just murdered another person.</i>

17:26.570 --> 17:28.940
<i>But if I hadn't done it, I would've died.</i>

17:29.850 --> 17:31.980
<i>So I can't back down now.</i>

17:33.450 --> 17:36.580
<i>If only the strong get to survive, then...!</i>

17:37.330 --> 17:39.200
Go to hell!

17:49.590 --> 17:52.200
How's an E-Rank got moves like that?!

17:52.700 --> 17:54.310
Son of a bitch...

17:59.310 --> 18:00.270
Kyuhwan!

18:00.270 --> 18:01.270
R-Right!

18:08.590 --> 18:09.860
Take this!

18:18.110 --> 18:19.200
He's so strong...

18:20.040 --> 18:24.170
He feels stronger now than when 
he was fighting the dungeon boss.

18:24.170 --> 18:27.290
H-He took my entire team apart in seconds...

18:27.790 --> 18:29.880
Was he hiding his true strength?

18:29.880 --> 18:32.520
You beat the boss, didn't you?!

18:33.470 --> 18:37.470
Well, I might be a C-Rank, too, 
but you'll find I'm nothing like them!

18:37.930 --> 18:39.610
Reinforcement!

18:43.800 --> 18:45.910
<i>This guy may be a monster,</i>

18:45.910 --> 18:50.020
<i>but after fighting a boss and five hunters, 
he can't be at full strength.</i>

18:50.320 --> 18:54.320
<i>The trick is in how fast he is, 
and in his dagger's special abilities.</i>

18:54.660 --> 18:57.950
<i>But when I use the Reinforcement skill, 
my body becomes as strong as steel!</i>

18:57.950 --> 19:00.740
<i>That knife of his won't affect me!</i>

19:06.090 --> 19:08.920
Mr. Hwang. You're strong.

19:10.060 --> 19:12.700
But I've got some bad news for you.

19:17.470 --> 19:21.110
I've been leveling up this entire time.

19:22.290 --> 19:24.770
<i>Wh-What just happened?</i>

19:24.770 --> 19:27.940
<i>He... He smashed me into the ground?</i>

19:28.460 --> 19:32.150
<i>There's no way in hell he's E-Rank!</i>

19:33.170 --> 19:35.250
H-Hang on! Don't kill me!

19:35.250 --> 19:37.790
You've gotta show mercy! I-I can pay you!

19:37.790 --> 19:41.700
The mana crystals and essence stones... 
You can have the lot!

19:42.470 --> 19:45.500
I-Is that not enough for you? 
I-In that case...

19:45.500 --> 19:48.170
I'll pay you double! Double what I was—

19:47.180 --> 19:48.170
Three times.

19:49.230 --> 19:51.940
You tried to kill me three times...

19:52.900 --> 19:54.670
and now you want mercy?

19:54.670 --> 19:58.760
D-Don't do it! Y-You won't get away with this!

19:59.300 --> 20:04.430
Weren't you the one who said nothing 
that happens in a dungeon ever gets out?

20:05.430 --> 20:09.060
You little shit! Do you have 
any idea who my brother—

20:24.710 --> 20:27.710
The boss is dead, so the dungeon's closing. 
Let's get out of here.

20:34.880 --> 20:37.920
You mean to tell me that all the 
C-Rank hunters died in action,

20:37.920 --> 20:43.500
and the only survivors were... 
a D-Rank and an E-Rank?

20:43.500 --> 20:46.350
That's true. Well...

20:47.640 --> 20:48.560
You!

20:48.560 --> 20:49.810
Y-Yes?!

20:49.810 --> 20:55.160
Your gear... That's the Maya Company's Kalion
Longsword! The one that just came out!

20:55.160 --> 20:56.780
Oh... Yeah.

20:57.120 --> 20:59.620
<i>I got rewarded for something like that, huh?</i>

20:57.510 --> 21:01.950
And that's Gredos's Royal Series!

20:59.990 --> 21:02.510
<i>The Murderous Intent skill...?</i>

21:03.690 --> 21:06.910
<i>It can cut all abilities in half, huh?</i>

21:06.910 --> 21:10.080
I see! Well, your equipment 
explains your survival.

21:10.590 --> 21:13.320
You must've handled everything yourself,

21:13.320 --> 21:16.710
while this E-Rank probably hid to say safe.

21:18.770 --> 21:22.830
I appreciate your cooperation 
after such an ordeal.

21:22.830 --> 21:24.790
That should be everything.

21:26.110 --> 21:27.470
E-Excuse me...

21:28.310 --> 21:31.940
B-Boss... Good work back there!

21:33.060 --> 21:34.160
Right.

21:41.090 --> 21:42.990
Is everything okay?

21:42.990 --> 21:44.020
I was just thinking...

21:45.680 --> 21:49.470
I'm glad I gave her that umbrella.
