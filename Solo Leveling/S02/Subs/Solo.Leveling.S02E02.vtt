WEBVTT

00:12.260 --> 00:13.080
Arise.

00:27.760 --> 00:28.780
Very good.

00:37.970 --> 00:41.680
(Solo Leveling Season 2
-Arise from the Shadow-)

02:00.600 --> 02:02.100
How long has it been?

02:02.520 --> 02:04.120
About three hours or so.

02:04.740 --> 02:07.820
It's been about three days inside.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.880
The environment inside is harsh.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.420
Alas.

02:12.700 --> 02:13.780
I guess

02:13.780 --> 02:16.340
Sung Jinwoo must have died.

02:16.940 --> 02:18.300
I made a wasted trip.

02:20.720 --> 02:21.540
No,

02:21.540 --> 02:22.640
wait.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.300
Sung Jinwoo isn't from
the White Tiger Guild.

02:26.900 --> 02:28.160
Then why did he go through the gate

02:28.160 --> 02:31.700
with your assault team?

02:34.340 --> 02:36.300
He is my friend.

02:36.760 --> 02:39.040
He was interested in a Level-C quest.

02:39.040 --> 02:40.320
That's why I brought him along.

02:41.100 --> 02:42.160
Alright.

02:42.160 --> 02:43.640
I see.

02:47.880 --> 02:50.000
Did you think I would say that?

02:50.300 --> 02:52.800
What are you up to?

02:53.160 --> 02:57.480
I know you love new things.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.980
Hwang Dongsoo.

03:01.020 --> 03:02.760
Let go.

03:03.180 --> 03:05.080
Are you ordering me?

03:05.440 --> 03:08.750
As a guild master from a small country?

03:09.480 --> 03:10.580
What did you say?

03:13.840 --> 03:15.320
This is bad.

03:15.540 --> 03:16.760
If we don't stop them,

03:17.120 --> 03:19.600
a fight between S-Rank hunters
will happen.

03:20.220 --> 03:21.500
So, you want a fight?

03:37.500 --> 03:38.960
It's because it's too cold.

03:39.880 --> 03:40.620
No.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.520
As long as I have gear,

03:42.520 --> 03:44.380
I won't lose at all.

03:46.380 --> 03:49.300
No wonder I didn't see any Ice Bears.

03:49.840 --> 03:50.680
Did the E-Rank hunters

03:51.000 --> 03:52.500
kill them all?

03:53.220 --> 03:54.120
Impossible.

03:54.120 --> 03:56.100
They couldn't possibly do it.

03:58.560 --> 03:59.800
I got it.

03:59.800 --> 04:00.800
It's the White Demon.

04:01.100 --> 04:02.120
The White Demon is here.

04:02.380 --> 04:03.440
Darn it.

04:09.100 --> 04:10.320
Pretty impressive.

04:12.500 --> 04:16.320
If you hadn't held back your strength,

04:16.660 --> 04:18.680
my arm might have been broken already.

04:21.320 --> 04:24.420
I don't know what you are suspecting.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.100
But about two months ago,

04:26.460 --> 04:29.240
I tested Mr. Sung's magic power again.

04:29.980 --> 04:32.880
He is indeed an E-Rank hunter.

04:33.660 --> 04:35.240
That's the investigation result.

04:35.240 --> 04:39.500
And magic beasts killed Hwang Dongsuk.

04:40.740 --> 04:43.460
That's your word on that.

04:43.780 --> 04:45.840
What an obvious lie.

04:46.080 --> 04:50.060
I guess Mr. Yoo actually murdered him.

04:51.560 --> 04:54.780
Why did you go after Sung Jinwoo?

04:56.280 --> 04:57.940
Well, of course,

04:58.540 --> 05:00.320
it was just an excuse.

05:00.980 --> 05:03.040
An excuse to kill.

05:09.940 --> 05:11.460
He is a lucky guy.

05:14.440 --> 05:15.640
Mr. Hwang.

05:16.260 --> 05:20.520
I know Mr. Sung's strength well.

05:21.200 --> 05:23.500
He will definitely come out alive.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.680
I lost all my money for weapons.

05:30.120 --> 05:31.720
No, I mean it.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.060
It's a big gap.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.720
Weak people,

05:36.180 --> 05:38.120
how are you still alive?

05:38.400 --> 05:39.760
You even have warm clothes, blankets,

05:39.760 --> 05:41.520
tents, and food.

05:42.700 --> 05:44.160
I get it.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.780
So that's what it was.

05:46.800 --> 05:47.940
You bad guys.

05:48.900 --> 05:50.280
Mr. Kim?

05:50.280 --> 05:52.720
The assault team has been annihilated

05:53.300 --> 05:56.100
because we lack food and gear.

05:56.100 --> 05:57.000
That is…

05:57.000 --> 05:58.760
Who hid these things?

05:59.160 --> 06:01.100
Who hogged all the gear

06:01.100 --> 06:03.240
and got other teammates killed?

06:03.780 --> 06:05.720
I figure it out now.

06:05.720 --> 06:07.040
Heejin.

06:07.280 --> 06:09.540
You knew it, didn't you?

06:09.840 --> 06:11.600
That's why you joined this team.

06:12.140 --> 06:14.680
Confess, or you'll be accomplices.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.660
I'll count to three. Confess honestly.

06:18.660 --> 06:19.740
One.

06:20.840 --> 06:23.480
-Two.
-The culprit is that guy.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.300
Sung Jinwoo.

06:25.300 --> 06:26.580
Three.

06:34.180 --> 06:36.960
You got your teammates killed.

06:36.960 --> 06:38.040
Sung.

06:38.040 --> 06:39.020
Captain.

06:39.420 --> 06:41.520
You even brought us trouble.

06:42.320 --> 06:43.760
Show up.

06:43.960 --> 06:46.940
You can't hide your strong presence.

06:49.015 --> 06:50.795
They are Ice Demons.

06:51.440 --> 06:53.100
We're outnumbered.

06:54.160 --> 06:55.200
Is he the boss?

07:00.060 --> 07:01.740
Among the trash,

07:02.200 --> 07:04.440
there is someone useful.

07:04.880 --> 07:05.960
What did you say?

07:06.428 --> 07:09.608
Are you saying we're all trash?

07:10.300 --> 07:13.000
Oh, that's really surprising.

07:13.560 --> 07:16.920
Kid, can you understand our language?

07:16.920 --> 07:17.620
Huh?

07:17.920 --> 07:19.040
Why can I understand it?

07:19.040 --> 07:22.140
Can you understand their language?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.760
Is this because of the system?

07:25.400 --> 07:28.160
If so, that would be perfect.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.620
This guy told me

07:31.560 --> 07:34.440
there's an expert among humans.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.260
He wanted to compete with you.

07:44.680 --> 07:45.360
And then?

07:48.240 --> 07:49.500
Interesting.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.040
It seems I can't beat him quickly.

07:59.360 --> 08:01.240
It's getting more interesting.

08:01.880 --> 08:03.280
That being said,

08:03.760 --> 08:05.680
you're clearly not human.

08:05.680 --> 08:08.000
Why are you mingling among humans?

08:08.300 --> 08:09.140
What?

08:10.180 --> 08:13.520
You don't even know who you are.

08:13.980 --> 08:16.260
We keep hearing a voice.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.480
It tells us to kill humans.

08:18.480 --> 08:22.040
But when facing you, I can't hear it.

08:22.320 --> 08:23.780
Hear a voice?

08:24.720 --> 08:26.940
Is it something similar
to system commands?

08:27.720 --> 08:30.060
He can't hear anything when facing me.

08:30.440 --> 08:32.560
Is it because I've become a player?

08:32.800 --> 08:35.280
There is no need for us to fight.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.700
Let's have the best of both worlds.

08:38.240 --> 08:40.660
Hand over the humans behind you,

08:41.020 --> 08:43.200
and we will spare your life.

08:43.200 --> 08:43.980
What do you think?

08:44.240 --> 08:46.060
How do you find this proposal?

08:47.020 --> 08:48.880
Who are you?

08:49.320 --> 08:51.180
Why do you fight humans?

08:52.020 --> 08:53.400
We are…

08:55.680 --> 08:58.020
Hand over the humans behind you,

08:58.360 --> 09:01.440
and we will spare your life.

09:02.320 --> 09:03.840
What just happened?

09:03.840 --> 09:04.700
What do you think?

09:04.920 --> 09:06.620
How do you find this proposal?

09:07.140 --> 09:08.650
You're going to accept it, right?

09:11.840 --> 09:12.780
I refuse.

09:14.200 --> 09:16.680
Are you planning to be our enemy?

09:17.480 --> 09:20.120
For the record, you're outnumbered.

09:21.740 --> 09:22.800
I beg your pardon?

09:31.600 --> 09:32.800
What is this?

09:32.800 --> 09:34.360
They're monsters.

09:34.360 --> 09:35.800
Monsters have appeared.

09:35.800 --> 09:38.800
Black soldiers and black Ice Bears.

09:39.140 --> 09:40.240
What?

09:40.240 --> 09:42.360
Mr. Sung, did you summon them?

09:43.220 --> 09:45.220
It's no use making a death struggle.

09:45.660 --> 09:46.840
A death struggle?

09:47.240 --> 09:48.720
Is it really so?

10:05.920 --> 10:06.740
Get away.

10:06.920 --> 10:09.660
It's not a battle we can be in.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.500
He truly has the capacity to boast.

10:20.180 --> 10:23.280
Soldiers can't be killed,
but they need MP.

10:24.300 --> 10:26.460
I'm running out of the MP.

10:27.080 --> 10:28.340
Anyway, their boss

10:29.080 --> 10:30.880
looks stronger than me.

10:37.900 --> 10:40.560
I can't even defeat him with Igris.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.220
Regular soldiers can't end this fight.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.180
I need stronger combat power.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.240
My name is Baruka.

10:49.220 --> 10:50.520
What's your name?

10:53.280 --> 10:54.300
Sung Jinwoo.

11:20.720 --> 11:23.820
I love this exciting battle.

11:38.580 --> 11:40.580
The last voice I heard…

11:45.540 --> 11:48.080
Sung Jinwoo.

11:50.380 --> 11:52.800
Luckily, the soldiers bought me time.

11:53.440 --> 11:54.440
Next up is…

11:55.260 --> 11:57.820
Is this all your soldiers can do?

11:59.520 --> 12:01.520
Sung Jinwoo.

12:01.740 --> 12:03.400
Just die!

12:03.400 --> 12:05.700
Even a human has betrayed you.

12:11.920 --> 12:13.240
Utterly boring.

12:13.580 --> 12:15.660
What a cheap trick.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.680
Sung Jinwoo.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.500
Just die!

12:27.500 --> 12:28.780
Kim Chul.

12:28.780 --> 12:30.520
I knew it.

12:36.100 --> 12:37.320
Utterly boring.

12:41.600 --> 12:42.960
Sung Jinwoo.

12:42.960 --> 12:44.080
You guy.

12:45.060 --> 12:46.460
From the very beginning,

12:47.180 --> 12:50.440
did you anticipate that I would come?

12:50.780 --> 12:52.280
Darn it.

12:54.560 --> 12:55.500
Arise.

12:58.480 --> 13:00.620
What a cheap trick.

13:15.720 --> 13:16.600
Iron.

13:17.280 --> 13:18.520
From today on,

13:18.960 --> 13:19.940
you will be called Iron.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.000
Quite interesting.

13:30.360 --> 13:32.680
I'll start by getting rid of you.

13:40.500 --> 13:43.220
You are moving way too slowly.

13:46.860 --> 13:47.880
Heejin.

13:48.180 --> 13:50.240
This is

13:50.240 --> 13:52.060
how hunters fight?

13:52.560 --> 13:53.760
If that's the case,

13:53.760 --> 13:56.360
how could I possibly become a hunter?

13:56.740 --> 13:58.340
I have never seen this before.

13:58.780 --> 14:01.240
We're not dreaming, right?

14:04.600 --> 14:07.120
This guy can't fight me.

14:07.560 --> 14:09.780
You and that knight,

14:09.780 --> 14:12.100
come at me together.

14:12.500 --> 14:13.760
Is that so?

14:25.360 --> 14:26.820
First of all,

14:27.800 --> 14:29.240
take you down.

14:38.820 --> 14:41.180
He actually avoided the vital areas.

14:42.720 --> 14:46.220
You are underestimating me too much.

14:46.220 --> 14:48.260
You are indeed very strong.

14:48.600 --> 14:49.400
However,

14:49.760 --> 14:51.640
your men are not.

14:59.100 --> 15:00.020
But

15:00.280 --> 15:03.460
if you die, those guys won't be an issue.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.060
You idiot, you threw away your weapon.

15:17.380 --> 15:18.480
Iron.

15:37.480 --> 15:41.140
Pretty good.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.680
I'm going to kill all of you.

15:46.900 --> 15:48.360
The outcome has been decided.

15:48.820 --> 15:50.820
Are you kidding me?

15:51.300 --> 15:53.300
It's not over yet.

16:03.920 --> 16:05.100
I told you.

16:07.480 --> 16:09.100
The outcome has already been decided.

16:13.900 --> 16:15.620
Have I finally defeated him?

16:21.040 --> 16:21.940
Hey.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.120
Stop.

16:24.640 --> 16:26.000
Don't go too far.

16:28.300 --> 16:29.920
I'm worried about your future.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.640
It's over, isn't it?

16:45.460 --> 16:46.200
Yes.

16:48.480 --> 16:49.760
Let's go.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.200
To the outside of the gate.

16:57.760 --> 16:59.520
Great.

16:59.740 --> 17:01.240
We can go home now.

17:01.240 --> 17:03.000
We can finally get out.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.380
What a day.

17:04.380 --> 17:05.780
We can go back now.

17:07.520 --> 17:08.620
Before that,

17:13.020 --> 17:17.040
it's been almost a week inside.

17:17.460 --> 17:19.700
We will stay here on standby.

17:20.020 --> 17:21.660
Mr. Baek, you go back.

17:22.280 --> 17:23.960
My members are trapped inside.

17:24.220 --> 17:25.720
I can't just go back.

17:26.220 --> 17:27.660
I'll wait here until dawn.

17:30.160 --> 17:31.100
There's a shadow.

17:31.100 --> 17:32.340
Someone is coming out.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.540
Mr. Kim.

17:35.140 --> 17:37.520
I knew you could do it.

17:39.300 --> 17:40.700
Mr. Baek.

17:41.760 --> 17:42.760
Miss Park.

17:43.340 --> 17:44.320
Mr. Go.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.900
It's good that you're alright.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.560
How are the other hunters?

17:57.600 --> 17:58.800
Mr. Sung.

17:59.900 --> 18:01.300
I knew it.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.520
The gate has disappeared.

18:09.300 --> 18:10.380
What about the other hunters?

18:10.660 --> 18:11.840
Where is Mr. Kim?

18:12.460 --> 18:13.300
So,

18:14.680 --> 18:17.160
only low-rank hunters survived?

18:17.540 --> 18:19.960
What exactly happened inside?

18:20.200 --> 18:20.980
Go back.

18:21.160 --> 18:21.960
I'll take you home.

18:22.280 --> 18:23.500
Okay.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.060
Please wait.

18:25.420 --> 18:27.460
May I have a word with you?

18:28.700 --> 18:30.160
I'm already tired.

18:30.620 --> 18:32.780
Whatever it is, ask the guild.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.220
This is not a request.

18:36.460 --> 18:38.640
It's an order, even a threat.

18:39.740 --> 18:41.080
In this incident,

18:41.280 --> 18:44.140
six members of our guild went missing.

18:44.500 --> 18:48.600
I'm in charge and must ask you something.

18:50.280 --> 18:51.940
That makes sense.

18:52.300 --> 18:54.800
But I saved two members of yours.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.360
As the person in charge,

18:56.740 --> 18:59.180
shouldn't you thank me first?

19:05.400 --> 19:06.680
Please forgive my rudeness.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.760
You are right.

19:09.920 --> 19:11.500
I am truly sorry.

19:15.720 --> 19:16.680
Miss Park.

19:16.960 --> 19:17.980
Yes?

19:18.280 --> 19:19.760
What's wrong with that guy?

19:20.340 --> 19:22.480
Why did he seem so mad?

19:22.760 --> 19:23.760
I don't know either.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.540
After defeating the boss,

19:25.540 --> 19:27.740
he got in a bad mood.

19:28.160 --> 19:31.700
I think he must feel quite exhausted.

19:31.700 --> 19:33.560
He is not a bad person.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Mr. Ahn.

19:37.320 --> 19:41.180
Make sure to bring him to our guild.

19:41.840 --> 19:42.700
Yes.

19:44.800 --> 19:47.740
Indeed, I did not misjudge.

19:51.000 --> 19:51.880
Thank you.

19:52.220 --> 19:53.300
Please be careful on your way back.

19:53.620 --> 19:54.400
Hmm.

19:55.640 --> 19:57.440
Well, Jinwoo.

19:58.540 --> 19:59.520
Jinwoo?

19:59.720 --> 20:01.980
Thank you for today.

20:02.860 --> 20:03.720
See you tomo…

20:04.060 --> 20:05.040
No.

20:05.260 --> 20:07.200
See you later.

20:14.220 --> 20:15.340
Yeah.

20:15.620 --> 20:18.140
Not even a day has passed outside yet.

20:19.280 --> 20:22.360
Only this stuff looks good.

20:23.900 --> 20:26.520
Because there's a big gap
between him and me?

20:35.440 --> 20:37.760
Three attempts failed.

20:37.760 --> 20:39.340
NUMBER OF EXTRACTION POSSIBLE: 0/3
YOU HAVE NO ATTEMPTS REMAINING

20:39.900 --> 20:41.740
I worked all day for nothing.

20:43.140 --> 20:43.900
No…

20:49.120 --> 20:49.980
Well…

20:51.420 --> 20:52.620
It's the third time already.

20:57.020 --> 20:58.480
Brother.

20:58.480 --> 21:00.300
I'm going to eat your breakfast.

21:00.540 --> 21:01.880
I'm coming out.

21:04.320 --> 21:05.700
Good morning.

21:07.240 --> 21:09.140
You came over in this costume?

21:09.480 --> 21:10.480
Yes.

21:10.480 --> 21:11.640
Alright, let's head out.

21:13.280 --> 21:14.420
Whatever.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.860
We'll pick someone up on the way.

21:16.860 --> 21:17.720
Eh?

21:19.740 --> 21:21.900
Good morning, Captain.

21:21.900 --> 21:23.400
Ah… Yeah.

21:23.400 --> 21:24.380
Good morning.

21:24.380 --> 21:25.860
Sorry for the trouble.

21:26.240 --> 21:27.160
Jinwoo.

21:28.300 --> 21:29.400
Jinwoo?

21:29.760 --> 21:31.140
Did you get some sleep afterward?

21:31.140 --> 21:33.140
I couldn't sleep at all.

21:33.460 --> 21:36.020
Right, it was morning
by the time you got home.

21:36.320 --> 21:37.840
-Yeah.
-Got home?

21:37.840 --> 21:38.860
Didn't sleep at all?

21:38.860 --> 21:39.940
How about you, Jinwoo?

21:39.940 --> 21:42.700
You two spent the night together?

21:43.080 --> 21:45.040
-You take a nap. I'll wake you when we arrive.
-Um…

21:45.040 --> 21:46.520
-Thank you.
-Boss?

21:46.520 --> 21:47.380
Hmm?

21:47.380 --> 21:48.880
Miss Han

21:49.280 --> 21:50.680
is underage.

21:52.000 --> 21:52.830
So?

21:57.640 --> 21:58.440
Nothing…

21:58.800 --> 22:00.060
Nothing…

22:02.600 --> 22:04.320
Let's set off and get it done soon.

22:04.320 --> 22:05.700
Yes, Jinwoo.

22:06.420 --> 22:07.340
Yes.
