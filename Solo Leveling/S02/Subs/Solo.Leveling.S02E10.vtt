WEBVTT

00:13.551 --> 00:15.303
<i>Goto Ryuji isn't fighting.</i>

00:15.386 --> 00:19.515
<i>But thanks to that, I can witness
a battle between S-rank hunters.</i>

00:20.099 --> 00:21.517
Now,

00:25.480 --> 00:27.148
let's begin.

02:06.998 --> 02:08.416
You want to compare strengths?

02:09.000 --> 02:10.877
That makes it simple.

02:10.960 --> 02:14.964
Alright. Let's see who's stronger.

02:22.722 --> 02:25.600
<i>He's fast, so I shouldn't
get into close combat with him.</i>

02:29.479 --> 02:33.107
My expertise lies in long-range combat.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.986
Hoshino, this is too dangerous.

02:37.070 --> 02:39.113
Take him down quickly.

02:43.659 --> 02:49.248
Master, this arena is reinforced
with top-tier magic gems, right?

02:49.332 --> 02:50.291
Yes.

02:50.374 --> 02:54.045
But it seems we need to reassess
the reinforcement standards.

02:55.088 --> 02:58.716
<i>They're the top-tier hunters
even among S-ranks.</i>

02:58.800 --> 03:01.177
<i>Merely restraining their arms
won't suffice.</i>

03:01.260 --> 03:03.554
<i>You must be prepared
to break them if necessary.</i>

03:04.806 --> 03:06.432
Yikes.

03:07.517 --> 03:09.060
<i>Is his name Atsushi Kumamoto?</i>

03:09.644 --> 03:12.230
<i>Seems he's not the combative type.</i>

03:14.107 --> 03:17.568
<i>Darn it. I'm bad at handling
these situations.</i>

03:17.652 --> 03:19.737
<i>My resolve wasn't enough after all.</i>

03:22.281 --> 03:27.161
<i>Perhaps he's using us to test them,</i>

03:27.245 --> 03:29.580
<i>so as to see if they have
the resolve to fight the ants.</i>

03:34.001 --> 03:36.337
<i>Since you chose me to test them,</i>

03:36.921 --> 03:38.798
<i>I'll gladly have them give you an answer.</i>

03:38.881 --> 03:41.426
<i>I can't handle this.</i>

03:45.096 --> 03:47.223
They're all monsters.

03:47.932 --> 03:50.017
An A-rank like me stands no chance.

03:50.101 --> 03:52.145
That's not true.

03:52.228 --> 03:54.313
You're plenty strong too, Master.

03:56.816 --> 03:59.485
Looks like I've won this match.

04:00.278 --> 04:02.405
Got smashed into the ground.

04:03.072 --> 04:04.740
This is the first time.

04:06.742 --> 04:08.453
Does this count as my win?

04:10.496 --> 04:11.706
Tch.

04:11.789 --> 04:13.374
How long will you keep running...

04:16.627 --> 04:19.213
Do you think I'm weaker than Hunter Cha?

04:19.297 --> 04:21.340
I'm being underestimated.

04:22.633 --> 04:24.719
<i>Can't read her movements.</i>

04:24.802 --> 04:26.596
<i>The Dancer Cha Hae-in.</i>

04:26.679 --> 04:29.307
<i>After seeing her dance-like footwork,</i>

04:29.390 --> 04:31.976
<i>it's clear her title is well-deserved.</i>

04:37.148 --> 04:39.108
<i>I need to help Hunter Baek.</i>

04:45.740 --> 04:47.116
What kind of move was that?

04:47.200 --> 04:50.119
<i>Oh no. I acted reflexively.</i>

04:54.582 --> 04:57.335
- Ah.
- He's about to lose his temper.

04:57.418 --> 05:01.047
Once he becomes like that,
no one knows what he might do.

05:01.130 --> 05:03.424
Should we stop him?

05:03.508 --> 05:05.384
If there's a risk of injury.

05:09.847 --> 05:11.390
<i>So fast.</i>

05:14.894 --> 05:16.479
This doesn't look good.

05:23.027 --> 05:25.363
You could say I'm meddling,

05:26.072 --> 05:28.824
but this has gone
beyond friendly sparring.

05:28.908 --> 05:30.701
Who do you think you are?

05:33.829 --> 05:37.250
No way. He instantly subdued
the enraged Kumamoto.

05:37.333 --> 05:40.586
Is he really a Mage?

05:40.670 --> 05:42.463
Yes, that's correct.

05:42.546 --> 05:45.174
I'll have to verify it myself.

05:45.758 --> 05:49.011
Hunter Cha. Shall we admit defeat?

05:49.804 --> 05:52.974
- Hunter Baek appears to be eliminated too.
- Okay.

05:55.059 --> 05:58.437
<i>Even going all out, I still couldn't win.</i>

06:00.690 --> 06:02.024
Hunter Sung.

06:02.108 --> 06:06.153
Our guild master Goto asked
if he may request a match.

06:06.821 --> 06:09.573
<i>He exudes combat spirit.</i>

06:09.657 --> 06:12.201
<i>Is he trying to gauge my strength?</i>

06:13.536 --> 06:15.246
<i>A perfect chance to test
how much I've improved</i>

06:15.329 --> 06:16.831
<i>since conquering the Demon's Castle.</i>

06:18.124 --> 06:20.001
He actually smiled in my presence.

06:20.835 --> 06:22.003
Mr. Goto.

06:22.086 --> 06:24.380
Hunter Sung agreed.

06:24.463 --> 06:27.591
- But with one condition.
- Condition?

06:28.175 --> 06:30.803
He stated he'd consent
only if you go all out.

06:33.889 --> 06:35.016
Interesting.

06:35.766 --> 06:39.395
<i>The 4th Jeju Island Raid Mission
is imminent.</i>

06:39.478 --> 06:43.983
<i>Our nation will collaborate with Japan
to ensure complete preparations.</i>

06:44.066 --> 06:46.235
Aren't you working today?

06:46.319 --> 06:48.487
It's my day off. I told you yesterday.

06:48.571 --> 06:49.947
Did you?

06:50.031 --> 06:51.949
The hunters are working hard.

06:52.033 --> 06:55.077
We should do our jobs properly too.

07:04.879 --> 07:05.921
Hello.

07:06.714 --> 07:08.174
Well,

07:08.257 --> 07:11.594
I'd like to ask about sentry team
of the Jeju Island Raid Mission.

07:12.303 --> 07:14.180
What's going on?

07:14.263 --> 07:16.974
The legendary 10th S-rank hunter.

07:17.058 --> 07:19.894
He's quite fiery,
challenging Goto to a duel.

07:19.977 --> 07:23.272
<i>I saw his combat skills
in A-rank dungeons.</i>

07:23.356 --> 07:25.900
<i>But can he handle an S-rank hunter?</i>

07:25.983 --> 07:27.985
You're surrounded by hunters today.

07:28.069 --> 07:29.570
Do you feel alright?

07:30.071 --> 07:33.616
I can't go to the battlefield
holding my nose.

07:34.408 --> 07:36.577
We're not going to stop them?

07:36.661 --> 07:40.081
For a close combat
between a Fighter and a Mage,

07:40.665 --> 07:42.875
normally, we should have intervened.

07:42.958 --> 07:45.961
But my thoughts align with yours,
Hunter Cha.

07:47.546 --> 07:49.715
Don't you have expectations of him?

07:50.299 --> 07:51.926
If it's truly as I predicted

07:52.009 --> 07:55.179
that Hunter Sung is the Awakened
who can keep evolving...

07:57.807 --> 07:59.183
Then let's start...

08:03.437 --> 08:05.272
<i>Hey, I haven't finished speaking yet.</i>

08:05.356 --> 08:07.483
<i>With that kind of speed and movement,</i>

08:07.566 --> 08:09.735
<i>you claim you are a Mage?</i>

08:09.819 --> 08:10.945
<i>Don't make me laugh.</i>

08:13.572 --> 08:15.866
<i>I'll expose your true nature.</i>

08:17.493 --> 08:21.122
<i>True, he's completely different
from other S-rank hunters.</i>

08:21.205 --> 08:23.999
<i>But, I can still dodge.</i>

08:24.083 --> 08:25.876
<i>He smiled again.</i>

08:25.960 --> 08:28.337
<i>His attacks are too fast to see.</i>

08:28.421 --> 08:30.548
He's dodging brilliantly.

08:30.631 --> 08:34.009
Just avoiding those attacks
is already remarkable.

08:34.093 --> 08:36.470
<i>He's not just dodging.</i>

08:37.138 --> 08:38.973
<i>He's testing his opponent's strength.</i>

08:43.769 --> 08:46.522
<i>The more he dodges, the angrier I get.</i>

08:46.605 --> 08:47.940
<i>I've changed my mind.</i>

08:48.023 --> 08:50.025
<i>I'll eliminate you with full power.</i>

08:56.949 --> 08:58.409
<i>Hunter Sung!</i>

09:03.539 --> 09:06.667
I almost lost one of my eyes there.

09:06.751 --> 09:09.462
He didn't grab my wrist, but my hand.

09:09.545 --> 09:11.255
Are you mocking me?

09:11.338 --> 09:13.632
I don't understand you.

09:14.633 --> 09:16.886
But if I grabbed your wrist,
the game would end.

09:17.470 --> 09:20.222
You don't want it
to end like this either, do you?

09:31.776 --> 09:33.194
Hey, Mr. Goto is serious.

09:33.277 --> 09:36.697
If they keep fighting,
neither will come out unscathed.

09:45.623 --> 09:46.957
<i>Ice...?</i>

09:47.583 --> 09:48.834
Hunter Sung.

09:48.918 --> 09:50.044
Mr. Goto.

09:50.127 --> 09:51.712
Let's stop here.

09:51.796 --> 09:54.465
No one can take responsibility
if something goes wrong.

09:55.049 --> 09:57.176
Please tell him the duel is over.

09:57.259 --> 09:58.636
Y...yes.

10:01.347 --> 10:03.682
- Did I interfere too much?
- No.

10:05.226 --> 10:09.480
Only getting a scratch
from fighting Goto, that's impressive.

10:12.358 --> 10:14.360
<i>I got too carried away.</i>

10:15.027 --> 10:16.612
<i>However,</i>

10:16.695 --> 10:19.990
<i>now I've known about everyone's strengths</i>

10:20.074 --> 10:23.285
<i>and infiltrated Shadow Soldiers
into their shadows.</i>

10:25.120 --> 10:29.458
I'll send you the list
of raid mission participants later.

10:29.542 --> 10:32.837
Please also send it
to our vice guild master.

10:32.920 --> 10:34.088
I will.

10:39.051 --> 10:40.553
Chairman Go.

10:41.470 --> 10:43.889
What is it, Hunter Sung?

10:44.473 --> 10:46.433
Regarding the Jeju Island raid mission...

10:49.395 --> 10:50.729
<i>Ryuji.</i>

10:50.813 --> 10:53.315
<i>There's an exceptionally
skilled hunter here.</i>

10:54.608 --> 10:57.486
Can't be stronger than
the guild master of Draw Sword Guild.

10:57.570 --> 10:58.988
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

10:59.071 --> 11:00.573
Which hunter are you referring to?

11:00.656 --> 11:02.074
<i>Sung Jinwoo.</i>

11:02.157 --> 11:04.827
<i>He's a Reawakened,
recently promoted S-rank hunter.</i>

11:05.953 --> 11:07.496
That's strange.

11:07.580 --> 11:10.916
This person isn't on
the raid mission's hunter list.

11:11.000 --> 11:11.917
What?

11:13.627 --> 11:17.548
Hunter Sung is not
joining the Jeju Island raid mission?

11:17.631 --> 11:20.426
He must have his reasons.

11:20.509 --> 11:21.552
But...

11:21.635 --> 11:24.513
<i>Byung-gu isn't listed either...</i>

11:24.597 --> 11:25.848
<i>But...</i>

11:25.931 --> 11:30.060
We now have 15 S-rank hunters.

11:30.644 --> 11:32.271
This time we must...

11:37.026 --> 11:39.153
Secure victory.

11:41.905 --> 11:44.825
- I'm home.
- Jinwoo, you're late.

11:46.160 --> 11:47.786
Welcome back, Jinwoo.

11:47.870 --> 11:49.788
Dinner is ready.

11:51.415 --> 11:52.791
I'm back.

11:54.001 --> 11:56.503
<i>My mother has awakened
after four years of sleep.</i>

11:56.587 --> 11:58.213
<i>She needs me now.</i>

11:59.173 --> 12:00.424
<i>So...</i>

12:01.300 --> 12:03.052
<i>I can't go to Jeju Island.</i>

12:06.930 --> 12:08.849
<i>Food supplies are exhausted.</i>

12:08.932 --> 12:10.392
<i>We have started eating each other.</i>

12:11.727 --> 12:16.023
<i>This land no longer
has food to nourish us.</i>

12:16.815 --> 12:18.692
<i>We can't continue like this.</i>

12:19.276 --> 12:20.819
<i>We must leave this island.</i>

12:22.237 --> 12:24.114
<i>We must have a stronger child</i>

12:24.657 --> 12:26.617
<i>to lead us.</i>

12:26.700 --> 12:29.995
<i>They need my powerful child.</i>

13:05.489 --> 13:08.367
<i>Grow stronger, my child.</i>

13:15.833 --> 13:18.919
<i>Ant-type monsters are evolving
at an alarming speed.</i>

13:19.503 --> 13:22.798
<i>During the 3rd Jeju raid mission,
ants were still crawling on the ground.</i>

13:23.382 --> 13:26.301
<i>This is the latest confirmed situation.</i>

13:26.385 --> 13:28.095
<i>Their forms now resemble those of humans</i>

13:28.178 --> 13:30.764
<i>with massive wings on their backs.</i>

13:30.848 --> 13:36.228
<i>The Hunter's Association announced
new strategies against ant-type monsters.</i>

13:39.273 --> 13:40.899
There it is, darn monster.

13:40.983 --> 13:43.485
I'll be your opponent as an S-rank hunter.

13:46.530 --> 13:48.615
It's too dangerous. Don't go.

13:48.699 --> 13:52.369
Why must I join the sentry team?

13:52.453 --> 13:55.831
But Miss Han, you're an E-rank hunter.

13:56.498 --> 13:58.625
- Ouch...
- You have the nerve.

13:58.709 --> 14:00.002
I'm sorry!

14:00.085 --> 14:04.298
<i>Considering the possibility
of ants landing on the mainland,</i>

14:04.381 --> 14:07.760
<i>the Association requests
all hunters to join the sentry team.</i>

14:13.724 --> 14:15.392
<i>Finally, it's tomorrow.</i>

14:15.976 --> 14:18.228
<i>The Jeju Island raid mission
is about to begin.</i>

14:22.024 --> 14:23.484
<i>This is the First Fleet,</i>

14:23.567 --> 14:26.111
<i>which arrived at the target location,
coastal waters of the Jeju Island.</i>

14:26.779 --> 14:29.073
<i>Second Fleet
arrived at the target location.</i>

14:29.782 --> 14:32.993
<i>Third Fleet is about
to enter the alert zone.</i>

14:33.077 --> 14:35.079
<i>Fourth Fleet is advancing.</i>

14:35.162 --> 14:37.915
<i>Estimated to arrive
at the target location in 5 minutes.</i>

14:38.874 --> 14:40.000
Master.

14:40.084 --> 14:42.711
Is our strength enough against the ants?

14:42.795 --> 14:45.005
We won't know unless we try.

14:45.756 --> 14:49.510
Our sentry team is here
precisely for such contingencies.

14:49.593 --> 14:51.762
We must eliminate the ants.
Don't let them reach the mainland.

14:51.845 --> 14:53.514
Cool, Master.

14:53.597 --> 14:56.725
I, Jung Yoontae,
pledge to follow you for life.

14:58.977 --> 15:01.480
Then I leave this place to you.

15:02.064 --> 15:04.233
We won't get to step in anyway.

15:04.316 --> 15:06.110
We'll just be idling here all day.

15:06.193 --> 15:08.195
There's always a contingency.

15:08.278 --> 15:11.448
It's because you are here

15:11.532 --> 15:13.909
that I can depart to the front line
with peace of mind.

15:16.078 --> 15:18.330
- Be careful on your way.
- Hmm.

15:18.413 --> 15:22.126
Huh? Why was Minsung assigned there?

15:22.209 --> 15:24.586
It could be troublesome.

15:24.670 --> 15:26.547
Transfer him to the rear.

15:43.772 --> 15:46.400
Reports from all units.

15:46.483 --> 15:49.111
All preparations on mainland coast

15:49.194 --> 15:51.113
and waters surrounding Jeju Island
are complete.

15:51.196 --> 15:54.741
The decoy unit has also
landed on the island.

15:54.825 --> 15:56.118
Hmm.

15:56.702 --> 16:01.832
Many hunters have
responded to this operation.

16:02.624 --> 16:04.084
Furthermore,

16:04.168 --> 16:07.004
<i>his decision to join
has given us a boost of confidence.</i>

16:14.052 --> 16:15.679
Byung-gu!

16:15.762 --> 16:18.223
Never thought you'd come.

16:18.307 --> 16:19.933
Without a healer like me here,

16:20.017 --> 16:22.644
you'd get instantly killed, Yoonho.

16:23.228 --> 16:26.231
You'll charge straight at magic beasts
the moment you see them, right?

16:26.315 --> 16:30.110
If I'm slow, you'll be the one dying.

16:36.158 --> 16:38.535
Is this the central urban area
on the island?

16:38.619 --> 16:41.246
This is Alpha, all units respond.

16:41.330 --> 16:43.540
Bravo, in position.

16:43.624 --> 16:45.834
Charlie, in position.

16:45.918 --> 16:48.378
Delta, ready to go.

16:50.422 --> 16:51.965
Live broadcast...

16:52.049 --> 16:52.966
Yes.

16:53.050 --> 16:56.053
However, to prevent accidents,
the footage will be delayed by 10 minutes.

16:56.136 --> 16:58.680
As a photographer
from the Hunter Report Team,

16:58.764 --> 17:01.683
I will broadcast the details
of this battle to the public.

17:01.767 --> 17:06.813
Okay. Hunters demonstrate their
true abilities when protecting others.

17:06.897 --> 17:10.734
This will be an intense battle.
Are you up for this?

17:10.817 --> 17:12.694
Rest assured.

17:12.778 --> 17:14.446
Despite appearances, I'm an A-rank hunter.

17:14.529 --> 17:16.240
I'm accustomed to filming
in dangerous zones.

17:16.323 --> 17:18.158
That's good.

17:19.076 --> 17:24.122
This might be ordinary folk's last chance
to witness an S-rank raid mission.

17:24.706 --> 17:26.833
No, we must make sure it's the final one.

17:27.668 --> 17:30.045
We must succeed this time.

17:30.629 --> 17:32.172
<i>If this operation fails,</i>

17:32.256 --> 17:35.008
<i>our nation will likely
be erased from the map.</i>

17:35.092 --> 17:38.720
<i>This country needs heroes...</i>

17:39.471 --> 17:44.017
The assault team is ready to deploy.

17:44.101 --> 17:45.727
Very well, I declare

17:46.436 --> 17:48.897
the 4th Jeju Island raid mission
officially commences.

17:48.981 --> 17:50.607
All units, deploy!

17:50.691 --> 17:51.900
Roger.

17:52.734 --> 17:55.362
The decoy unit is moving out.

17:55.445 --> 17:57.572
The magic power energy is terrifying.

17:57.656 --> 17:59.658
They're making their move too.

18:00.951 --> 18:03.370
Hey, they're heading this way.

18:03.453 --> 18:05.080
Open the hatch.

18:05.163 --> 18:07.165
I'll handle them.

18:16.675 --> 18:17.718
Incredible...

18:18.635 --> 18:20.095
There are many of them.

18:21.430 --> 18:23.682
Seems we'll need drastic measures.

18:31.064 --> 18:34.109
<i>I've finally reached this place.</i>

18:34.192 --> 18:36.903
<i>Standing on this land once again...</i>

18:40.073 --> 18:42.576
No wonder he's the Ultimate Hunter.
Very reliable.

18:43.243 --> 18:45.996
Alright everyone, let's descend.

18:48.540 --> 18:53.295
Japan's hunters can stall those ants
for at most one hour.

18:53.378 --> 18:58.050
Meaning we must eliminate
the queen within that timeframe.

18:58.133 --> 18:59.593
Is everyone ready?

19:01.094 --> 19:03.013
We can definitely do this.

19:04.056 --> 19:05.265
Let's move.

19:07.517 --> 19:09.853
We're commencing our operation.

19:09.936 --> 19:11.772
Activate interference wave.

19:11.855 --> 19:13.398
Interference wave activated.

19:15.692 --> 19:20.322
<i>Now the ants won't receive
the queen's distress signals.</i>

19:21.823 --> 19:22.699
Yikes!

19:22.783 --> 19:25.410
Kumamoto, fear will get you killed.

19:28.747 --> 19:31.083
Could we have eliminated all these ants

19:31.166 --> 19:34.753
before they can kill the queen?

19:34.836 --> 19:37.255
Possibly. Where is Kenzo?

19:37.339 --> 19:38.882
He's over there playing.

19:38.965 --> 19:40.467
Just like a child.

19:41.051 --> 19:42.594
Did you see those flames?

19:42.677 --> 19:44.805
Must be from that Choi guy.

19:44.888 --> 19:48.016
I wonder who would win if I fought him.

19:48.600 --> 19:50.977
Could be alternating temperatures.

19:53.021 --> 19:54.564
Exits have been sealed.

19:54.648 --> 19:57.401
Let's move quickly
while they're all lured out.

19:57.484 --> 19:59.903
But there are so many tunnels.

19:59.986 --> 20:03.698
How do we find the tunnel
leading to the queen?

20:12.040 --> 20:14.334
What are you doing? It's too dangerous.

20:14.418 --> 20:17.796
We don't have time to check each one.

20:18.630 --> 20:22.008
Just find the deepest tunnel.

20:22.592 --> 20:24.511
Looks like that's the one.

20:31.268 --> 20:33.562
Daily quest is complete.

20:33.645 --> 20:36.148
The streets are empty today.

20:38.191 --> 20:42.404
All S-rank Hunters
on this raid mission are top-tier ones.

20:42.988 --> 20:45.198
They could easily complete the operation.

20:46.283 --> 20:47.784
Even without someone like me.

20:51.079 --> 20:53.915
Is the queen really here?

20:53.999 --> 20:55.917
Maybe it abandoned them and fled.

20:56.001 --> 20:58.712
This is an island,
so it can't go anywhere.

20:58.795 --> 21:01.173
Everyone, check this out.

21:04.885 --> 21:06.386
An egg chamber...

21:06.470 --> 21:08.805
The queen's chamber must be nearby.

21:10.182 --> 21:11.308
Look.

21:12.267 --> 21:13.477
That egg...

21:14.060 --> 21:16.980
Is that also an ant egg?

21:17.063 --> 21:19.107
It's enormous...

21:19.191 --> 21:22.027
Our mission is to kill the queen.

21:22.110 --> 21:23.945
Don't bother with other things.

21:24.029 --> 21:27.282
<i>But can't blame him for reacting that way.</i>

21:27.365 --> 21:29.201
<i>Ant evolution remains unpredictable.</i>

21:29.826 --> 21:34.456
<i>If there's an ant from that giant egg...</i>

21:35.749 --> 21:37.250
Darn.

21:37.334 --> 21:40.128
Annoying pest made me hurt my shoulder.

21:40.212 --> 21:41.880
Want me to heal you?

21:41.963 --> 21:43.757
But it's not free.

21:43.840 --> 21:44.841
Shimizu.

21:44.925 --> 21:46.885
Quit fooling around
and heal me right away.

21:46.968 --> 21:48.762
There's something I want.

21:48.845 --> 21:50.972
Instead of money...

21:52.390 --> 21:53.725
Here we go again...

21:54.518 --> 21:55.685
Fine.

21:56.478 --> 21:58.188
What exactly do you want...
