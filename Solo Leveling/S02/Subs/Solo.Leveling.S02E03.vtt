WEBVTT

00:13.700 --> 00:15.620
S-Sir...

00:16.960 --> 00:18.790
What are these things?

00:18.790 --> 00:22.500
Oh, right,
I haven't shown them to you yet.

00:23.170 --> 00:24.860
This is one of my skills.

00:26.550 --> 00:30.030
You can summon these things
with your skill?

00:30.930 --> 00:34.000
It's a bit complicated to explain it.

00:54.080 --> 00:55.160
Sir.

00:56.200 --> 01:00.070
At least let me collect the magic gems.

01:04.210 --> 01:07.480
T-Thank you...

01:15.510 --> 01:17.200
Oh, no!

01:19.230 --> 01:20.270
Jesus!

01:22.810 --> 01:23.480
Hey.

01:23.980 --> 01:25.720
Don't shout so loudly.

01:26.270 --> 01:27.360
Don't worry.

01:27.360 --> 01:29.490
They just passed out.

01:30.700 --> 01:32.600
Yeah, no way youâ€™ll understand that, huh?

01:33.110 --> 01:35.700
I barely speak English.

01:41.830 --> 01:43.210
I am human.

01:43.790 --> 01:46.560
I want to go home.

01:57.720 --> 02:01.430
SOLO LEVELING SEASON 2
-ARISE FROM THE SHADOW-

03:21.760 --> 03:22.970
Cheers!

03:23.520 --> 03:25.350
Welcome, please come in.

03:28.520 --> 03:31.070
Now we've completed 19 quests.

03:31.070 --> 03:31.980
Yes.

03:31.980 --> 03:34.690
I wouldn't have done it without you.

03:35.280 --> 03:36.610
What are your plans next?

03:37.320 --> 03:40.030
First, I'm going to take
the written test at the association

03:40.030 --> 03:41.950
to get the guild master's license.

03:41.950 --> 03:45.080
Then I'll use it as a bargaining chip
to negotiate with my father.

03:45.580 --> 03:46.250
I see.

03:46.910 --> 03:49.330
How about you, Sir?

03:53.550 --> 03:55.940
You might not be able
to contact me for a while.

03:56.380 --> 03:58.230
I need to go somewhere...

04:00.970 --> 04:01.980
What's wrong?

04:05.770 --> 04:06.890
Sir...

04:06.890 --> 04:10.560
If you find me annoying,
you can just say it.

04:10.560 --> 04:14.120
And I won't bother you anymore.

04:16.530 --> 04:18.320
Are you drunk?

04:19.030 --> 04:22.360
I have a brother who is
10 years older than me.

04:22.910 --> 04:24.890
He doesn't like me.

04:25.580 --> 04:28.640
We have never spent time
together as brothers.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.540
Compared to him,

04:31.210 --> 04:35.670
not only did you save my life,
but you also agreed to my request.

04:37.050 --> 04:41.800
I really wish you were my brother.

05:01.490 --> 05:02.470
In that case,

05:07.830 --> 05:11.040
you are my younger brother from now.

05:15.420 --> 05:17.460
S-Sir...

05:21.720 --> 05:22.680
Meat!

05:22.680 --> 05:24.140
Please have some more meat!

05:24.140 --> 05:25.600
I will grill it for you!

05:25.600 --> 05:27.600
Hey, that's too much!

05:27.600 --> 05:28.890
Would you like some lemon?!

05:28.890 --> 05:29.850
No.

05:29.850 --> 05:31.520
You really are drunk, aren't you?

05:31.890 --> 05:33.760
I'm completely sober now!

05:34.400 --> 05:35.130
Geez.

05:35.730 --> 05:37.480
What do I do with you?

05:42.450 --> 05:44.070
Have you identified him?

05:44.700 --> 05:46.990
He claimed to be a foreign Hunter.

05:47.450 --> 05:52.120
He was trapped in a Gate 10 years ago
and couldn't get out.

05:52.580 --> 05:55.840
Then he found himself at the Gate
leading to the United States.

05:56.670 --> 05:58.590
That's unprecedented.

05:59.010 --> 05:59.920
Anything else?

06:00.510 --> 06:02.550
It seems he can't speak English.

06:02.550 --> 06:04.920
And an interpreter-assisted
interrogation is pending.

06:05.390 --> 06:08.090
It can't be ruled out that
he might be a humanoid beast.

06:08.640 --> 06:09.900
What can we do about him?

06:10.730 --> 06:12.100
We have requested assistance

06:12.100 --> 06:15.940
from an S-Rank Hunter in Washington
who is his compatriot.

06:16.980 --> 06:18.520
Mr. Hwang?

06:19.360 --> 06:22.410
We can proceed with the investigation
once he returns to the country.

06:22.860 --> 06:23.360
Tsk.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.070
That's good then.

06:25.070 --> 06:27.240
By the way, what's his name?

06:27.740 --> 06:30.490
It's a bit hard to pronounce.

06:31.540 --> 06:34.180
He says his name is Sung Il-Hwan.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.970
I'm going out for a week.

06:43.300 --> 06:45.720
Going on a trip right after work?

06:45.720 --> 06:47.770
You are so busy.

06:47.770 --> 06:49.840
Well, I have lots of things to do.

06:50.600 --> 06:53.010
So, who are you going with?

06:56.730 --> 06:58.520
I said I'm going with a friend.

06:58.520 --> 07:00.980
When did you get a girlfriend?

07:08.490 --> 07:12.620
While fighting Cerberus,
my level was around 20.

07:13.370 --> 07:15.550
And now my level has tripled.

07:16.460 --> 07:19.030
I should be able to defeat it more easily.

07:37.900 --> 07:39.990
Does it mean I should keep going?

07:48.280 --> 07:50.160
Oh? It's a quest.

07:50.870 --> 07:53.700
"The Demon's Castle is teeming with demons."

07:53.700 --> 07:56.250
"Please collect demon souls."

07:56.910 --> 07:59.460
"The requirement is to collect..."

07:59.460 --> 08:01.040
10,000 demon souls?!

08:02.210 --> 08:04.000
That's a lot.

08:07.720 --> 08:11.350
But this time, I came for another purpose.

08:11.350 --> 08:13.060
ELIXIR OF LIFE - CRAFT

08:14.270 --> 08:16.640
Be it 10,000 or 100,000...

08:18.890 --> 08:20.290
I'll get them all!

08:25.820 --> 08:27.070
YOO JINHO

08:27.070 --> 08:30.160
You're asking me
to hand over the guild to you?

08:30.160 --> 08:30.990
Yes.

08:31.370 --> 08:32.160
Hmm...

08:33.910 --> 08:38.000
You know Jinsung's plan,
yet you still make this request?

08:39.210 --> 08:42.590
My brother's plan to have
an outsider become the guild master

08:42.590 --> 08:45.480
is too risky for our company...

08:47.130 --> 08:50.380
That Hunter is Sung Jinwoo, right?

08:50.840 --> 08:52.120
The Double Dungeon incident.

08:52.560 --> 08:54.930
The annihilation of Hwang Dongsuk's team.

08:55.430 --> 08:58.300
And the Supervision Department's
killing of prisoners.

08:59.070 --> 09:02.030
He's involved in all three incidents
and remained unscathed.

09:04.110 --> 09:07.430
He also participated in all
the raid missions you organized.

09:09.400 --> 09:13.240
In the Red Gate incident of
the White Tiger Guild a few days ago,

09:14.410 --> 09:18.040
it's said that it was again him
who brought out the survivors.

09:21.920 --> 09:26.300
You obtained the guild master license
with his help, didn't you?

09:27.020 --> 09:29.220
And you want me to hand over
the guild to you?

09:33.840 --> 09:34.890
Even so...

09:37.680 --> 09:38.680
Even so,

09:40.480 --> 09:43.000
I still ask you to hand over
the Yoojin Guild to me.

09:45.270 --> 09:47.190
As for my brother, I will...

09:47.190 --> 09:49.940
I understand. I can let you give it a try.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.280
Eh?

09:51.280 --> 09:52.970
But there's a condition.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.870
After that Red Gate incident,

09:58.290 --> 10:02.510
I've heard that the White Tiger Guild has
been trying to secretly recruit Hunter Sung.

10:03.420 --> 10:06.340
You have to let him join
our guild before that happens.

10:07.380 --> 10:08.330
Can you do it?

10:10.880 --> 10:11.670
Yes!

10:15.800 --> 10:17.210
I have high hopes for you.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.520
THE MANA IS CONTAMINATED
SHADOW EXTRACTION IS NOT AVAILABLE

10:21.520 --> 10:25.280
For some reason,
I can't extract from the demons.

10:26.060 --> 10:28.230
There are so many demons here.
What a pity.

10:30.530 --> 10:31.320
Oh?

10:31.320 --> 10:32.440
YOU ACQUIRED ITEM: ENTRY PERMIT

10:36.780 --> 10:39.700
A permit to the upper floors.

10:39.700 --> 10:41.020
THE PERMIT GRANTS ACCESS TO
THE 2ND FLOOR OF THE DEMON'S CASTLE.

10:41.020 --> 10:42.330
IT CAN ONLY BE USED ON THE MAGIC
TELEPORTATION CIRCLE ON THE 1ST FLOOR.

10:42.330 --> 10:43.620
I see.

10:43.620 --> 10:45.880
It can only be used there.

10:46.580 --> 10:48.630
This dungeon is huge.

10:49.090 --> 10:52.090
It seems to be an entire city
stuffed into a building.

10:54.130 --> 10:56.050
Walking on foot can be tiring.

11:05.730 --> 11:08.190
Are you the boss of that
group of Ice Bear?

11:08.190 --> 11:09.480
You're so big, aren't you?

11:10.480 --> 11:13.070
Alright, let's go over there to take a look.

11:14.240 --> 11:14.950
Hmm?

11:16.280 --> 11:17.410
Ah.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.910
What a headache.

11:18.910 --> 11:19.930
Woah.

11:22.330 --> 11:23.790
Eek!

11:29.420 --> 11:30.340
You're pretty strong.

11:32.380 --> 11:34.630
From now on, your name is "Tank."

11:49.400 --> 11:51.690
Wow, it's Miss Hae-In.

11:51.690 --> 11:53.280
What a coincidence.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.620
She is beautiful as usual.

11:58.490 --> 11:59.740
Why?

11:59.740 --> 12:03.200
Why not disclose the information
about the winged ants to the public,

12:03.200 --> 12:04.690
but to a small group of people?

12:05.620 --> 12:07.500
It's an order from the association.

12:07.500 --> 12:10.920
They believe that disclosing it now
would only cause unnecessary panic.

12:11.380 --> 12:12.250
But...

12:12.590 --> 12:13.880
Don't worry about it.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.670
We need to build up our power

12:17.300 --> 12:22.010
to become the largest guild in the country
and take on the responsibilities.

12:24.970 --> 12:29.680
When obtaining this key, I was worried that
this place might be an S-Rank dungeon.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.860
The demons here seem to be
around the upper B-Rank.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.070
ITEM: ENTRY PERMIT
6TH FLOOR TO 7TH FLOOR

12:34.070 --> 12:35.400
They come in great numbers.

12:35.940 --> 12:38.240
And the higher I go,
the stronger they get.

12:38.650 --> 12:42.950
But as long as I focus on taking down
the demons carrying permits,

12:42.950 --> 12:44.660
it's still an easy climb up.

12:45.120 --> 12:45.870
SKILLS
SKILL LEVEL INCREASED, RULER'S HAND, LV.2

12:46.540 --> 12:50.790
Still, if the structure of the Demon's Castle
is the same as that of the original tower,

12:50.790 --> 12:52.890
then there will be 100 floors.

12:53.930 --> 12:58.310
I wonder how strong I'll become
when I reach the top floor.

12:58.920 --> 12:59.880
DEMON SOULS COLLECTED: 3,712/10,000

12:59.880 --> 13:02.100
I don't know if there'll be enough food.

13:02.720 --> 13:04.560
And I have a promise with Jinah.

13:04.560 --> 13:05.510
DEMON SOULS COLLECTED: 4,059/10,000

13:05.510 --> 13:06.810
It seems...

13:06.810 --> 13:09.130
...this will be a battle against time.

13:10.310 --> 13:12.310
DEMON SOULS COLLECTED

13:13.650 --> 13:14.900
DEMON SOULS COLLECTED

13:16.230 --> 13:18.780
DEMON SOULS COLLECTED

13:18.780 --> 13:19.950
DEMON SOULS COLLECTED: 10,000/10,000

13:23.870 --> 13:25.760
I don't know how high I can climb.

13:39.970 --> 13:41.050
Red-name enemy, huh?

13:42.340 --> 13:44.010
LORD OF THE LOWER FLOORS
AVARICIOUS VULCAN

13:44.550 --> 13:46.970
49TH FLOOR TO 50TH FLOOR

13:50.350 --> 13:52.730
Hunter Sung is not at home.

13:53.940 --> 13:55.860
There's only his sister.

13:55.860 --> 13:58.980
She only knows that he's gone on a trip.

13:59.490 --> 14:02.240
We've come all the way
to his place in vain.

14:02.240 --> 14:05.490
He hasn't participated
in any raid missions recently.

14:05.490 --> 14:07.540
There are no records of him
crossing the border.

14:07.540 --> 14:10.700
His last known location tracked by
the association was in the very center

14:10.700 --> 14:12.580
of the urban area.

14:12.580 --> 14:15.170
How do you even know that?

14:16.590 --> 14:18.040
It's my job after all.

14:20.670 --> 14:24.000
I wonder where he is right now.

14:24.470 --> 14:27.050
Leave that big boss to me.

14:27.550 --> 14:29.430
You take care of the rest.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.990
Thanks to the increase in intelligence,

14:46.990 --> 14:50.830
the number of soldiers and magic power
I can preserve has increased as well.

14:50.830 --> 14:53.040
It gives me plenty of leeway
during combat.

14:53.960 --> 14:54.960
But anyway,

14:55.750 --> 14:58.080
how long does it plan to sit there?

14:58.080 --> 15:00.690
If it doesn't move,
I'll take the initiative to attack...

15:07.890 --> 15:10.760
What have you done to them?!

15:14.730 --> 15:15.850
Whoa...

15:15.850 --> 15:17.800
I just threw a punch.

15:18.410 --> 15:20.190
Did I put too many points into strength?

15:25.950 --> 15:27.610
The same skill that Cerberus used!

15:33.040 --> 15:33.790
Iron!

15:43.880 --> 15:45.630
Continuous blows...

15:45.630 --> 15:47.800
How can it be so nimble?

15:48.470 --> 15:51.510
But there must be an opening for me...

15:52.720 --> 15:53.790
Now!

15:57.230 --> 15:57.900
I got you!

16:00.360 --> 16:00.940
Darn...

16:00.940 --> 16:01.520
SKILLS
SKILL LEVEL INCREASED, RULER'S HAND, LV.2

16:06.860 --> 16:07.990
This beast...

16:08.390 --> 16:10.450
...can read my movement?

16:10.950 --> 16:15.160
The only place I can inflict damage
is that small head.

16:19.830 --> 16:22.590
First, I need to restrict
its strange movements.

16:23.590 --> 16:24.760
But how?

16:26.340 --> 16:27.380
That's it!

16:38.440 --> 16:40.440
Did your rage make you blind
to your surroundings?

16:58.250 --> 16:59.250
YOU HAVE DEFEATED THE
LORD OF THE LOWER FLOORS: AVARICIOUS VULCAN

16:59.250 --> 17:00.920
ITEM: WORLD TREE FRAGMENT

17:02.500 --> 17:05.170
I can't believe there's
a talking magic beast.

17:06.920 --> 17:09.550
I've said it many times,
I am not a magic beast.

17:09.550 --> 17:14.220
If you don't believe me,
you can test my DNA or whatever.

17:14.220 --> 17:15.720
Shut up.

17:15.720 --> 17:18.180
Just answer my question.

17:18.810 --> 17:22.080
I'm quite annoyed for being
called out during a good time.

17:22.890 --> 17:23.720
Heck.

17:24.230 --> 17:27.180
They dumped this trouble on me.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.700
Hey, can I ask a question?

17:29.700 --> 17:31.410
I told you to shut up!

17:32.290 --> 17:36.370
How much do humans know
about the Gates and magic beasts?

17:36.370 --> 17:37.040
Huh?

17:37.400 --> 17:40.790
How much do you know
about the Gates and magic beasts?

17:41.420 --> 17:43.290
What are you talking about?

17:43.750 --> 17:46.250
Dungeons, Gates, magic beasts...

17:46.750 --> 17:48.550
All those are just premonitions.

17:49.050 --> 17:53.390
The worst catastrophic force
has finally awakened.

17:53.390 --> 17:54.850
What is that?

17:55.550 --> 17:57.450
"The worst disaster."

17:57.450 --> 17:59.010
I can only say this much.

18:00.100 --> 18:01.210
So?

18:03.100 --> 18:06.900
My goal is to prevent
the disaster from happening.

18:08.570 --> 18:11.070
Stop spouting nonsense.

18:11.070 --> 18:13.990
Do you know how many Hunters
there are in the world now?

18:13.990 --> 18:15.820
If we gather the Hunters...

18:15.820 --> 18:19.660
A number of people are powerless
in the face of that force.

18:19.660 --> 18:22.210
They will only be devoured and exploited.

18:22.210 --> 18:24.330
You seem to have some strength...

18:24.330 --> 18:25.130
What?

18:27.460 --> 18:31.340
A magic beast has a name like humans, huh?

18:31.800 --> 18:34.930
And you also have a wife and two kids.

18:38.220 --> 18:40.390
Do you still remember your son's name?

18:41.310 --> 18:42.100
Jinwoo.

18:44.520 --> 18:46.810
Why do you have this murderous aura?

18:48.070 --> 18:51.030
I've said I won't answer your questions.

18:51.030 --> 18:51.860
Answer me.

18:51.860 --> 18:53.450
No, I will not.

18:54.320 --> 18:57.320
But I can tell you one thing.

18:58.330 --> 19:00.790
Your son is already dead.

19:01.870 --> 19:06.000
If there are any last words,
go tell him yourself in hell.

19:21.800 --> 19:24.360
What's this? The battle is one-sided.

19:25.190 --> 19:27.300
Are you surprised by our strength?

19:27.980 --> 19:29.850
You didn't expect this, did you?

19:31.020 --> 19:33.320
Do immortal magic beasts also feel fear?

19:33.990 --> 19:34.990
Fine.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.040
YOU HAVE DEFEATED
METUS, GUIDE OF SOULS

19:52.670 --> 19:54.090
Over here!

19:54.090 --> 19:55.010
Quickly!

19:55.350 --> 19:57.800
I have heard of it.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.530
When S-Rank Hunters fight each other,

19:59.530 --> 20:02.140
that power can destroy and turn
the surroundings into ruins.

20:02.680 --> 20:04.720
So this is the disaster...

20:04.720 --> 20:07.270
Yeah, we can consider ourselves lucky.

20:07.270 --> 20:08.230
In an instant...

20:08.770 --> 20:09.940
In the blink of an eye...

20:10.390 --> 20:12.690
Mr. Hwang has been defeated.

20:12.690 --> 20:15.800
He lost before the disaster spread.

20:20.870 --> 20:23.030
The food has run out.

20:23.450 --> 20:24.990
This is as far as I can go.

20:26.580 --> 20:28.410
I'm on the 75th floor,

20:28.410 --> 20:30.630
so there should be about 25 floors left.

20:31.130 --> 20:33.080
I have a long way to go.

20:33.630 --> 20:36.390
But the harvest is quite bountiful.

20:37.510 --> 20:40.220
This earring was obtained
from the big boss on the 50th floor.

20:40.800 --> 20:43.910
The necklace was
from the skeleton just now.

20:44.510 --> 20:46.060
SET ITEM EFFECT
Both have impressive effects.

20:46.060 --> 20:47.140
ALL STATS +5
Both have impressive effects.

20:47.140 --> 20:49.230
ALL STATS +5
But the set item effect is more noteworthy.

20:49.900 --> 20:54.690
Judging by the display, there should be
another boss-level magic beast.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.450
This Avaricious Glass is also nice.

20:58.810 --> 21:01.030
Although it's of no use to me,

21:01.030 --> 21:03.830
I can transfer it to someone else.

21:03.830 --> 21:07.830
If magic soldiers have it,
their magic power will be doubled.

21:08.290 --> 21:09.690
Besides...

21:10.460 --> 21:13.850
Cursed Random Loot Box
I chose in the quest rewards.

21:14.750 --> 21:18.040
I thought I could no longer obtain it,
which made me somewhat regretful.

21:19.550 --> 21:21.300
I guessed so.

21:21.300 --> 21:23.010
It is still a key.

21:24.010 --> 21:25.510
Information unclear?

21:25.510 --> 21:27.270
When and where is this to be used?

21:27.270 --> 21:29.140
ITEM: UNKNOWN

21:29.140 --> 21:31.900
However, these are not my purpose
for this journey.

21:33.900 --> 21:35.190
World Tree Fragment

21:35.190 --> 21:38.740
was obtained when killing Avaricious Vulcan
on the 50th floor,

21:39.780 --> 21:43.990
and Echo Forest Water was obtained
after killing the Guide of Souls,

21:43.990 --> 21:45.870
Metus on the 75th floor.

21:46.490 --> 21:48.910
Among the three materials
for the Elixir of Life,

21:48.910 --> 21:50.330
I have already obtained two.

21:51.330 --> 21:52.370
Just one more to go.

21:53.210 --> 21:54.960
Just one more item for saving Mom...

21:57.170 --> 22:00.170
I will get it next time I come here.

22:41.010 --> 22:43.680
SOLO LEVELING

22:43.680 --> 22:47.180
EPISODE 15: STILL A LONG WAY TO GO

23:36.190 --> 23:39.940
EPISODE 16: I NEED TO STOP FAKING
