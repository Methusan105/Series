00:09.050 --> 00:10.100
What is going on?

00:11.550 --> 00:14.010
These black soldiers...

00:38.280 --> 00:39.790
What exactly are they?

00:47.040 --> 00:49.140
C-Could it be...

00:50.460 --> 00:53.170
Why? Why is he here?

01:03.310 --> 01:04.520
Mr. Song.

01:05.020 --> 01:08.550
This means the broadcast
has been interrupted, right?

01:10.980 --> 01:14.100
What exactly happened?

01:17.490 --> 01:18.450
Can't get through.

01:18.450 --> 01:20.100
There seems to be chaos there.

01:20.580 --> 01:23.080
Our top priority is to confirm
the safety of the Hunters.

01:23.370 --> 01:25.120
Gathering information comes after.

01:25.120 --> 01:26.100
Yes.

01:28.130 --> 01:29.080
Director!

01:29.080 --> 01:32.920
Our phone lines are about to be overloaded
due to inquiries from viewers!

01:32.920 --> 01:35.340
And they're asking us
to broadcast the live footage!

01:35.340 --> 01:37.130
I would if I could!

01:37.130 --> 01:40.640
Forget about live footage,
we can't even contact them now!

01:41.810 --> 01:46.070
And what if all the S-Rank Hunters
were wiped out?

01:48.310 --> 01:50.060
Hey, answer me!

01:50.060 --> 01:51.730
What's going on over there?

01:53.440 --> 01:54.110
Darn!

01:54.460 --> 01:55.860
The camera malfunctioned.

01:56.280 --> 01:57.450
At this critical moment...

01:58.450 --> 01:59.110
Iron!

02:07.700 --> 02:08.620
Do it.

02:20.010 --> 02:22.100
I'm completely confused.

02:22.470 --> 02:24.060
What are these things?

02:24.680 --> 02:28.230
And why is Hunter Sung here?

02:31.060 --> 02:32.360
Hunter Sung.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.690
When did you come here?

02:33.690 --> 02:35.650
And how did you get here?

02:35.650 --> 02:36.900
I'll explain later.

02:37.360 --> 02:39.650
Let me heal your injuries first.

02:40.030 --> 02:40.960
Please drink this.

02:42.950 --> 02:44.120
Oh, right.

02:44.120 --> 02:46.160
This can't be transferred.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.880
Oral medication?

02:48.880 --> 02:50.540
Is it subspace magic?

02:50.540 --> 02:51.630
Master Ma.

02:53.210 --> 02:54.840
Please open your mouth.

02:59.260 --> 03:00.590
This is...

03:05.220 --> 03:06.430
The wounds...

03:06.770 --> 03:07.810
...have all recovered.

03:16.270 --> 03:17.690
She hasn't recovered yet.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.780
Why isn't it working on her?

03:19.780 --> 03:21.400
BECAUSE THE HIT POINTS OF THE TARGET
ARE TOO LOW, POTION DOES NOT WORK.

03:21.890 --> 03:23.660
Is this the same as last time?

03:24.950 --> 03:27.410
It's not good.
Her aura is getting weaker.

03:28.540 --> 03:30.710
I can't heal such a serious injury.

03:31.250 --> 03:32.790
Let's get out of here quickly.

03:32.790 --> 03:34.290
I'll clear the way.

03:34.290 --> 03:35.460
- Okay.
- Wait!

03:40.880 --> 03:43.130
They come wave after wave...

03:43.130 --> 03:45.470
Their numbers are too many.

03:49.810 --> 03:50.930
Master!

03:50.930 --> 03:52.770
How is the assault team doing?

03:52.770 --> 03:54.060
We can't grasp it yet.

03:54.060 --> 03:57.190
There must be temporary signal
interference on the whole island.

03:58.190 --> 04:01.780
We've tried to contact Japan's team,
but we can't reach them either.

04:01.780 --> 04:03.240
The same goes for private media.

04:03.240 --> 04:06.160
The image was cut off
after the black ant appeared.

04:06.870 --> 04:08.990
Restore communication quickly.

04:09.620 --> 04:12.830
Order the medical
and recovery teams to stand by.

04:12.830 --> 04:13.580
Roger!

04:17.590 --> 04:18.890
I have never...

04:20.090 --> 04:23.680
...hated my body and heart so much.

04:25.180 --> 04:29.060
Even if I can't help,
I want to fight alongside them.

04:30.220 --> 04:31.270
Master...

04:31.930 --> 04:33.020
Please...

04:33.560 --> 04:35.520
Please be safe.

04:38.940 --> 04:41.400
Geez, what is going on?

04:41.780 --> 04:46.110
I thought the image was cut off,
but even the TV broke.

04:46.110 --> 04:47.370
I can't believe it.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.240
Hitting it won't fix it.

04:49.910 --> 04:52.330
I'll go back to my room for a bit.

04:53.460 --> 04:56.340
Maybe I can find some information
on my phone.

04:59.710 --> 05:01.300
What an impatient child.

05:02.670 --> 05:05.260
What's going on? Explain it.

05:05.260 --> 05:07.950
Mr. Goto's survival signal is off.

05:09.110 --> 05:10.970
From the communication before the outage

05:11.390 --> 05:15.940
and the strong enemy reaction
at that moment, I believe he died in battle.

05:16.600 --> 05:17.810
What about the others?

05:17.810 --> 05:19.400
We are currently checking them now.

05:19.900 --> 05:21.520
You better hurry up.

05:21.520 --> 05:24.110
If we keep losing Hunters,
it'll affect the plan.

05:25.650 --> 05:26.450
Yes.

05:31.700 --> 05:33.680
Goto get killed?

05:34.200 --> 05:35.290
How useless!

05:36.540 --> 05:38.850
What is happening on that island?

05:48.130 --> 05:50.680
Igris and Iron can manage
to fend off them.

05:51.430 --> 05:53.800
But the infantry are at
a slight disadvantage.

05:54.720 --> 05:57.310
I do want to enhance combat power,

05:57.770 --> 06:00.120
but there are too many people here.

06:01.230 --> 06:01.980
No.

06:02.570 --> 06:03.270
Everyone.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.240
At this rate, we'll be in danger.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.530
I will carve out a path.

06:09.030 --> 06:09.910
So I ask you...

06:11.240 --> 06:13.270
...to follow behind him.

06:13.830 --> 06:16.430
Others clad in black will
hold off the ants for us.

06:17.540 --> 06:21.540
If some ants slip through and attack you,
please deal with them by yourselves.

06:21.920 --> 06:25.090
Got it. You can leave that to us.

06:25.090 --> 06:26.010
Yeah.

06:26.460 --> 06:30.990
And also, please do not
disclose what you see next.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.430
Could it be...

06:55.660 --> 06:57.290
That ant has returned.

06:57.830 --> 06:59.460
Does it mean...

07:00.080 --> 07:01.670
...it has killed Goto?!

07:19.770 --> 07:22.350
There is no king outside.

07:23.020 --> 07:27.820
Is the one called the king here?

07:29.530 --> 07:34.100
The shadow attached to Goto lost contact
because of that one?

07:34.950 --> 07:35.580
Ah...

07:35.580 --> 07:36.990
Hey!

07:56.760 --> 08:01.060
Are you the king of humans?

08:03.690 --> 08:04.690
Oh?

08:05.110 --> 08:07.360
You can talk even though
you're just an insect.

08:08.360 --> 08:09.650
Human...

08:12.240 --> 08:14.320
Such a strong presence.

08:21.040 --> 08:21.790
As expected,

08:22.210 --> 08:23.860
an insect is just an insect.

08:24.900 --> 08:26.880
Even if it's Hunter Sung...

08:26.880 --> 08:28.710
To face it alone...

08:33.970 --> 08:36.090
Director, the image is restored!

08:36.930 --> 08:37.550
What...

08:37.550 --> 08:39.090
This is...

08:39.680 --> 08:41.680
Start the broadcast, quickly!

08:41.680 --> 08:42.560
Eh?!

08:42.560 --> 08:45.940
If we start now, it will completely
turn into a live broadcast!

08:45.940 --> 08:48.730
If something happens,
we won't have time to respond!

08:48.730 --> 08:50.900
We've already cut off once!

08:50.900 --> 08:52.440
It can't get any worse!

08:52.440 --> 08:53.110
Do it!

08:53.110 --> 08:54.240
Y-Yes!

08:54.860 --> 08:57.110
Ourâ€” No...

08:57.110 --> 08:59.100
The fate of this battle...

08:59.100 --> 09:01.160
...depends on this person.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.580
Mr. Song!

09:03.580 --> 09:04.620
Is that...

09:05.420 --> 09:06.580
This is...

09:12.670 --> 09:13.670
No way...

09:13.670 --> 09:15.380
Why...

09:16.090 --> 09:17.840
Big brother?!

09:17.840 --> 09:19.890
He said he was going out for a bit...

09:19.890 --> 09:20.930
Eh?!

09:20.930 --> 09:22.680
He joined it again?

09:25.060 --> 09:28.080
I knew you'd join them, Hunter Sung!

09:29.360 --> 09:32.360
But how did he get to the island?

09:32.360 --> 09:34.530
That is not important right now.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.030
Let's believe in him.

09:50.340 --> 09:53.130
Why would a Mage
get so close to the enemy?!

09:53.130 --> 09:55.090
He has underestimated that ant!

09:55.510 --> 09:57.590
He took a punch to the face!

09:58.300 --> 09:59.300
So weak.

09:59.930 --> 10:01.430
You are notâ€”

10:25.200 --> 10:26.410
Master Baek...

10:26.410 --> 10:27.340
Master Choi...

10:28.370 --> 10:30.880
Is he really a mage-type Hunter?

10:30.880 --> 10:33.250
I am not too sure either.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.710
I didn't know he was so strong.

10:37.130 --> 10:38.630
He is very tough.

10:39.110 --> 10:40.390
Is it because of his shell?

10:59.030 --> 11:00.490
What an intense battle!

11:00.490 --> 11:03.410
As an A-Rank Hunter, just standing
would use up all my strength.

11:05.120 --> 11:08.370
The impact of their magical power
is almost making me lose consciousness.

11:13.290 --> 11:17.130
I'm being pushed back...?

11:28.220 --> 11:29.650
Why...

11:31.100 --> 11:32.770
Who is...

11:33.480 --> 11:36.400
...this human?!

12:02.220 --> 12:03.340
This is...

12:04.220 --> 12:07.370
This is a deadly poison
I refined from the toxins

12:07.370 --> 12:10.560
inside the surrounding marine life
by using my magic power.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.480
You can't move anymore.

12:15.020 --> 12:18.130
You're finished now.

12:20.490 --> 12:21.570
Human...

12:22.320 --> 12:23.450
...die!

12:27.950 --> 12:30.160
Seven out of ten are dead.

12:30.160 --> 12:31.830
Are you kidding me?

12:32.330 --> 12:34.120
No, it's the truth.

12:34.540 --> 12:36.830
Contact has been made
with the remaining Hunters.

12:36.830 --> 12:38.210
So we have confirmed it.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.720
More than half died?!

12:42.720 --> 12:44.700
How can you be so useless?!

12:45.220 --> 12:49.640
And now strong reactions
reappeared near the crater.

12:50.060 --> 12:52.600
That should be the one
that killed Mr. Goto.

12:52.960 --> 12:55.480
As it fought with Goto,
how is it still alive?!

12:55.480 --> 12:58.190
And you said it went to the nest?! Why?!

12:58.190 --> 12:59.460
I'm not sure.

12:59.460 --> 13:01.320
Maybe it has some purpose.

13:01.690 --> 13:03.590
Or maybe it returned injured...

13:05.660 --> 13:08.490
The condition of
the Hunters there is unknown.

13:08.490 --> 13:10.700
But if they're still alive,
they'll run into it.

13:10.700 --> 13:12.830
Even Goto couldn't kill it.

13:12.830 --> 13:15.060
They will never be a match,
as they are exhausted.

13:15.060 --> 13:18.000
That ant should also be worn out
from continuous battles.

13:18.630 --> 13:23.260
As long as we can kill it,
the rest are just minions.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.410
There is still a chance.

13:26.970 --> 13:29.680
Immediately retrieve
the three remaining Hunters!

13:30.260 --> 13:34.640
Unite with the second assault team
at sea and attack again!

13:35.560 --> 13:36.980
That's the order.

13:36.980 --> 13:39.060
A helicopter will pick you up right away.

13:39.980 --> 13:40.980
Got it.

13:43.360 --> 13:45.360
We are going to implement Plan No. 9.

13:45.360 --> 13:46.320
Let's go.

13:46.780 --> 13:47.780
No...

13:48.740 --> 13:50.740
That thing is a monster...

13:51.410 --> 13:53.880
We can't defeat it...

13:54.750 --> 13:56.160
Get yourself together!

13:56.160 --> 13:57.670
Have some guts, will you?!

13:58.020 --> 14:00.000
We can't possibly defeat that one!

14:00.460 --> 14:03.210
We have to escape!
We will be killed if we don't escape!

14:05.010 --> 14:06.470
You are a disgrace.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.840
We have no choice but to do it.

14:31.460 --> 14:33.240
Wasn't he poisoned?

14:33.240 --> 14:35.080
Was he alright?

14:36.330 --> 14:39.170
I wouldn't be surprised
by anything anymore.

14:40.330 --> 14:42.250
So you had a secret weapon, huh?

14:43.630 --> 14:46.460
No wonder you seemed so confident.

14:46.460 --> 14:47.170
BUFF: HEALTH AND LONGEVITY

14:47.170 --> 14:48.420
BUFF: HEALTH AND LONGEVITY
DETOXING IS COMPLETE

14:49.300 --> 14:52.430
However, I don't know if it's because
my perception has improved.

14:52.970 --> 14:54.890
I can sense its emotions...

14:55.660 --> 14:57.350
...and its anxiety.

14:58.180 --> 14:59.810
Actually, it's the same for me.

15:02.060 --> 15:03.200
Every second counts now.

15:04.110 --> 15:05.400
I have to finish this soon!

15:16.660 --> 15:20.330
Poison is ineffective against him.
Competing in strength is meaningless.

15:21.040 --> 15:21.870
Then...

15:43.270 --> 15:44.270
ITEM: DEMON MONARCH'S DAGGER

16:36.240 --> 16:38.450
His speed is not inferior to mine.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.950
And he's getting even faster.

16:43.210 --> 16:45.620
Why is this happening?

17:45.310 --> 17:46.640
Upgrade...

17:47.230 --> 17:48.520
Mutilation?

17:53.360 --> 17:54.860
W-What's going on?!

17:59.820 --> 18:00.910
This is bad...

18:05.040 --> 18:06.290
Healing ability?

18:07.540 --> 18:09.000
What's going on...?

18:12.000 --> 18:14.090
What was that just now?!

18:38.490 --> 18:42.030
Who exactly is that human...?

18:42.370 --> 18:46.120
That human...!

18:50.250 --> 18:50.920
Go.

19:15.570 --> 19:16.690
Why...

19:17.610 --> 19:21.250
I should be above everyone else...

19:22.360 --> 19:28.370
I should be consuming everything
and growing, aiming for the pinnacle...

19:28.370 --> 19:30.620
I should be the king...

19:30.620 --> 19:32.330
But now...

19:35.000 --> 19:36.340
Run...

19:37.250 --> 19:38.840
I have to run away quickly...

19:39.300 --> 19:43.760
To survive, I have to run away now!

19:47.180 --> 19:49.390
Get as far away as possible!

20:07.990 --> 20:09.750
Quickly...

20:10.160 --> 20:12.210
Get far away quickly!

20:16.590 --> 20:17.800
ACTIVE SKILL: MUTILATION

20:45.570 --> 20:46.910
Those ants...

20:46.910 --> 20:48.580
...ran away.

20:48.580 --> 20:49.800
Did we win?

20:53.540 --> 20:54.580
Hunter Sung!

21:01.510 --> 21:02.920
Her aura...

21:02.920 --> 21:04.470
We have to be quick.

21:04.970 --> 21:06.470
Let's leave here.

21:06.470 --> 21:09.810
The evacuation helicopter is parked
outside. As long as we get on it...

21:09.810 --> 21:10.680
No.

21:10.680 --> 21:12.350
She can't hold on until then.

21:12.350 --> 21:13.710
Then what should we do?!

21:17.730 --> 21:19.770
Isn't that ineffective on her?

21:19.770 --> 21:21.230
This one hasn't been tried yet.

21:26.410 --> 21:29.330
The Elixir of Life that cured
my mother's Eternal Slumber...

21:29.910 --> 21:30.830
This one...

21:31.240 --> 21:33.190
This is the last resort.

21:35.960 --> 21:38.210
Not covered by the drug?

21:41.800 --> 21:43.050
Is it not working?

21:44.210 --> 21:46.380
It'll be too late to evacuate now.

21:46.380 --> 21:47.590
The potion has no effect.

21:48.090 --> 21:50.930
Shadow Exchange also
needs time to be usable again.

21:52.220 --> 21:53.140
Is there...

21:53.970 --> 21:55.670
Is there no other way?

22:42.060 --> 22:44.730
SOLO LEVELING

22:44.730 --> 22:48.240
EPISODE 24: ARE YOU THE KING OF HUMANS

23:37.330 --> 23:41.000
EPISODE 25: ON TO THE NEXT TARGET

23:41.080 --> 23:43.080
