00:13.950 --> 00:17.660
(Solo Leveling Season 2
-Arise from the Shadow-)

01:43.950 --> 01:45.870
What are you doing there?

01:47.610 --> 01:49.010
I'll ask one more time.

01:49.920 --> 01:51.850
What are you doing there?

01:55.590 --> 01:56.790
How careless…

01:57.050 --> 01:58.760
What was I thinking?

02:00.030 --> 02:02.590
I got lost and ended up here.

02:03.090 --> 02:04.430
Got lost?

02:05.110 --> 02:06.470
Are you from the mining team?

02:06.710 --> 02:07.970
This is the BOSS room.

02:08.250 --> 02:09.410
Please step back.

02:09.970 --> 02:10.790
Cha Hae-In.

02:11.570 --> 02:13.290
She truly lives up to her reputation.

02:13.890 --> 02:15.970
I didn't notice her at all
until she spoke.

02:18.490 --> 02:19.490
Did I see it wrong?

02:19.830 --> 02:21.890
Wasn't he just holding a weapon?

02:22.130 --> 02:23.130
I am sorry.

02:23.530 --> 02:25.210
Please hurry out.

02:25.670 --> 02:27.490
If you agitate the boss,

02:27.490 --> 02:29.830
the mining team may get annihilated.

02:30.250 --> 02:31.190
I understand.

02:39.170 --> 02:40.260
Umm, hold on.

02:41.090 --> 02:41.970
Yes.

02:48.810 --> 02:50.770
He isn't smelly.

02:51.430 --> 02:52.830
What are you doing?

02:53.370 --> 02:55.710
Are you really a hunter?

02:56.590 --> 02:58.050
Uh, yes…

03:00.210 --> 03:01.510
E-rank…

03:01.830 --> 03:03.210
Sung Jinwoo.

03:06.650 --> 03:07.850
It's nothing.

03:08.190 --> 03:09.910
This dungeon is very large.

03:10.150 --> 03:11.570
Be careful on your way back.

03:11.850 --> 03:12.750
Okay.

03:16.090 --> 03:18.010
Is it because his rank is too low?

03:18.830 --> 03:20.130
He's not smelly at all.

03:22.670 --> 03:23.590
On the contrary,

03:24.290 --> 03:25.470
he smells rather pleasant.

03:27.210 --> 03:29.970
I heard you met Hunter Cha
when you were lost.

03:30.270 --> 03:31.730
You are so lucky.

03:32.050 --> 03:35.430
We can only admire her from a distance.

03:37.110 --> 03:39.670
She patrols to protect us from the boss,

03:39.890 --> 03:43.090
sacrificing her own rest time.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.810
She is a very reliable young woman.

03:46.490 --> 03:47.970
That's why she came to the BOSS room.

03:49.010 --> 03:52.730
Hunter Cha feels uncomfortable
with the scent of other hunters.

03:53.030 --> 03:55.310
The scent of hunters?

03:55.870 --> 03:57.830
I heard it's due to
her unique constitution.

03:58.130 --> 04:00.910
She always covers her nose
with a handkerchief.

04:01.310 --> 04:02.370
Right.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.530
But her reaction to me…

04:06.690 --> 04:09.750
I don't have
the distinct scent of a hunter.

04:10.610 --> 04:14.190
In the red gate, that guy
said something similar.

04:15.010 --> 04:16.790
Is it because I am a player?

04:18.470 --> 04:21.370
The only one favored by the system.

04:21.930 --> 04:24.830
What exactly is the so-called player?

04:26.070 --> 04:27.510
Thank you for your work.

04:27.850 --> 04:29.170
Thank you.

04:29.830 --> 04:31.690
Thanks to you, we finished work early.

04:32.170 --> 04:35.150
Never thought we'd finish earlier
than the recovery team.

04:35.510 --> 04:37.630
You have talent for this.

04:37.630 --> 04:40.690
I thought you secretly used the excavator.

04:40.690 --> 04:42.290
You flatter me.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.570
I've been in this line of work
for a long time.

04:44.570 --> 04:47.450
But I've never come across
a talent like you, Sung.

04:50.890 --> 04:51.670
Sung.

04:51.930 --> 04:53.750
Are you interested in working for me?

04:54.490 --> 04:55.850
You'll be rewarded fairly.

04:56.350 --> 04:57.450
Well…

04:57.450 --> 04:59.230
I'm glad to hear you say so.

04:59.730 --> 05:01.830
But this is a one-time thing for me…

05:02.610 --> 05:04.150
I see.

05:04.150 --> 05:05.430
That's a pity.

05:05.990 --> 05:08.890
But could you help for one more day?

05:09.330 --> 05:10.350
One more day?

05:10.570 --> 05:11.230
Yes.

05:11.430 --> 05:15.130
Tomorrow, there are back-to-back
A-rank and C-rank raid missions.

05:15.930 --> 05:17.790
The evaluation will be conducted
the day after tomorrow.

05:18.190 --> 05:21.090
Today, I've gotten a grip
on the raid process.

05:21.870 --> 05:22.570
Wait.

05:22.730 --> 05:23.450
Tomorrow?

05:24.250 --> 05:26.650
Hunters Guild also have
raid missions tomorrow?

05:26.650 --> 05:28.330
A-rank and C-rank missions simultaneously?

05:28.610 --> 05:29.390
Yes.

05:29.390 --> 05:32.670
But the 2nd assault team
will be coming tomorrow.

05:32.990 --> 05:34.430
The 2nd assault team…

05:34.730 --> 05:36.910
That is our strength.

05:37.250 --> 05:40.130
We can raid A-rank gates
with two groups of people.

05:40.130 --> 05:42.550
No one else in the country can do it.

05:43.370 --> 05:45.530
Then, where should I report tomorrow?

05:46.330 --> 05:48.350
So you are willing to help?

05:48.670 --> 05:51.690
I will talk to the boss about
doubling your salary tomorrow.

05:51.690 --> 05:53.450
Eh… you don't have to…

05:53.450 --> 05:56.290
Come on, that's the least I could do.

05:59.630 --> 06:04.870
Could you help inquire about
Sung Jinwoo in the mining team?

06:05.130 --> 06:06.590
Do you mean Hunter Sung?

06:06.990 --> 06:08.290
Do you know him?

06:08.630 --> 06:12.810
Mr. Choi said the same to me yesterday.

06:13.170 --> 06:14.610
Mr. Choi?

06:14.610 --> 06:15.430
Yes.

06:15.430 --> 06:18.930
But all the information
about him has been sealed.

06:18.930 --> 06:19.710
Eh?

06:19.710 --> 06:21.470
He's not a top-tier hunter,

06:21.470 --> 06:24.430
yet his information was blocked
by the association. That's new to me too.

06:25.190 --> 06:26.530
I see.

06:30.330 --> 06:31.990
His behavior in the dungeon.

06:32.550 --> 06:34.550
Mr. Choi ordered an investigation.

06:35.170 --> 06:36.550
The association blocked the information.

06:37.630 --> 06:39.370
There must be something behind it.

06:40.630 --> 06:43.130
I've met so many hunters.

06:44.450 --> 06:46.150
But this is my first time

06:46.490 --> 06:48.130
meeting someone with a nice scent.

06:53.910 --> 06:55.430
Oh, he's here.

06:55.810 --> 06:56.910
Sung.

06:56.910 --> 06:58.260
Good morning.

07:00.890 --> 07:03.450
Sung, have you been eating well?

07:04.010 --> 07:05.550
Hi, Sung.

07:06.050 --> 07:08.780
Jinwoo, please don't get hurt today.

07:12.950 --> 07:15.830
I haven't felt this way in a long time..

07:16.610 --> 07:19.410
Let's eat together today.

07:19.410 --> 07:21.230
Yeah, you came after all.

07:21.490 --> 07:22.290
Okay.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.950
Alright, let's start with C-rank dungeon.

07:24.950 --> 07:26.690
The assault team is about to come out.

07:26.690 --> 07:27.850
Everyone needs to get ready.

07:30.970 --> 07:33.090
He's again doing a great job.

07:33.090 --> 07:34.430
Mm-hmm.

07:35.550 --> 07:38.510
With Sung, the progress is much faster.

07:38.970 --> 07:42.410
Thanks to you, we can rest and
go into the A-rank dungeon after lunch.

07:42.890 --> 07:45.050
The recovery team is also amazed.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.590
Do you really not want to work with us?

07:48.210 --> 07:49.290
I'll give you five times the salary.

07:50.030 --> 07:51.190
I'm sorry.

07:51.690 --> 07:52.530
Hey.

07:54.450 --> 07:56.070
Captain Son Kihoon.

07:56.730 --> 07:59.890
Can I borrow someone
from your mining team?

08:00.170 --> 08:02.810
The person in charge of
carrying luggage couldn't come.

08:03.190 --> 08:04.450
From us?

08:04.690 --> 08:07.150
The recovery team should
be better at moving stuff.

08:07.410 --> 08:09.950
They said they are also short-staffed.

08:09.950 --> 08:10.910
Hmm…

08:11.910 --> 08:15.950
If you go in with the assault team,
you will receive the risk allowance.

08:18.210 --> 08:22.090
Portering in an A-rank dungeon
is not fit for low-rank hunters.

08:22.550 --> 08:24.630
Offering more money wouldn't change that.

08:26.230 --> 08:28.310
No one wants to go?

08:29.750 --> 08:30.730
I'll go.

08:33.850 --> 08:35.510
Uh… Sung!

08:35.510 --> 08:36.850
This is too reckless.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.290
There are high-rank magic beasts inside.

08:39.290 --> 08:42.130
That money isn't worth
risking your life for.

08:42.130 --> 08:43.390
It's alright.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.450
Actually, I'm quite bold.

08:45.690 --> 08:48.890
It's not about being bold.

08:49.410 --> 08:53.030
He just joined the team yesterday,
so he doesn't understand anything.

08:53.470 --> 08:54.390
His rank?

08:54.390 --> 08:55.570
E-rank.

08:56.170 --> 08:57.670
So please find someone else.

08:57.670 --> 08:59.750
No, he'll do it.

09:00.030 --> 09:01.210
Eh…

09:02.630 --> 09:06.470
I am the leader
of this attack team, Son Kihoon.

09:06.990 --> 09:08.230
I am Sung Jinwoo.

09:10.650 --> 09:12.390
It's even bigger than that of yesterday.

09:12.910 --> 09:15.830
But the magic power is not
as strong as that of the gate yesterday.

09:16.570 --> 09:17.870
Be assured.

09:18.070 --> 09:19.750
If it's too dangerous,

09:19.750 --> 09:22.410
they wouldn't send us, the second team.

09:23.290 --> 09:26.230
Six A-rank and three B-rank hunters.

09:27.050 --> 09:28.590
Although there are no S-rank hunters,

09:28.970 --> 09:33.010
they wouldn't be a second team
in other guilds.

09:34.210 --> 09:35.410
Let's set off.

09:36.850 --> 09:37.930
Hunters Guild

09:38.170 --> 09:40.610
has two assault teams of this level.

09:48.650 --> 09:51.370
The magic power inside
is less than that of yesterday.

09:52.070 --> 09:53.110
But for some reason,

09:53.850 --> 09:56.630
I have a sort of ominous premonition
similar to confronting the red gate.

09:57.550 --> 09:58.950
I must be overthinking.

09:59.450 --> 10:01.190
Don't be nervous.

10:02.070 --> 10:03.030
Kihoon…

10:03.030 --> 10:03.970
Ah.

10:04.410 --> 10:07.290
All the hunters here
led by the captain are very strong.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.210
If you stick with us,

10:09.210 --> 10:11.830
you won't be attacked by magic beasts.

10:12.530 --> 10:13.770
Thank you.

10:14.890 --> 10:16.710
After this raid mission is completed,

10:17.030 --> 10:18.810
I will be officially
appointed as the captain.

10:19.490 --> 10:21.650
Although I'm not as good as
Captain and Vice-captain,

10:22.230 --> 10:23.890
I'm nonetheless an A-rank hunter.

10:24.410 --> 10:25.850
I can do it.

10:31.870 --> 10:33.990
They got ready without any instructions.

10:39.010 --> 10:39.770
It's coming.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.230
It's Dungeon Jackals.

10:59.690 --> 11:00.380
Get down.

11:12.710 --> 11:15.050
Why are Dungeon Jackals
in an A-rank dungeon?

11:16.070 --> 11:18.250
Are they rare magic beasts?

11:18.890 --> 11:21.290
Because they are C-rank magic beasts.

11:21.910 --> 11:24.710
It wouldn't be surprising
if they all died in the dungeon.

11:27.210 --> 11:28.170
Collar?

11:28.830 --> 11:29.770
Please look here.

11:29.970 --> 11:31.630
It seems they were being raised.

11:32.170 --> 11:35.150
They were spared and used as hunting dogs?

11:41.650 --> 11:43.750
It seems my premonition was correct.

11:53.970 --> 11:54.970
High Orcs.

11:55.270 --> 11:56.190
How could it be?

12:11.250 --> 12:13.050
Their power is astonishing.

12:16.330 --> 12:17.870
He-ah!

12:20.490 --> 12:22.250
The taunting skill is ineffective.

12:22.250 --> 12:23.450
They've targeted the back-line!

12:23.450 --> 12:24.530
Watch out!

12:27.430 --> 12:29.190
We won't be taken down that easily.

12:33.670 --> 12:34.950
That strike was ineffective.

12:35.230 --> 12:36.910
Their magic resistance is too strong.

12:49.210 --> 12:50.670
It's too strong.

12:50.670 --> 12:53.070
I can only hold it back for a few seconds.

12:53.350 --> 12:54.650
I'll summon help now.

12:55.450 --> 12:57.410
Those who obey my command,

12:58.930 --> 13:00.590
take the enemy's head.

13:05.390 --> 13:07.630
This is my trump card
that consumes a lot of MP.

13:08.170 --> 13:09.290
How about it?

13:21.450 --> 13:22.430
Healer!

13:22.430 --> 13:23.650
We need you here.

13:23.650 --> 13:25.510
Wait, I'll be right there.

13:26.510 --> 13:28.010
We are outnumbered!

13:28.210 --> 13:30.250
If we're surrounded, we will be done for.

13:30.250 --> 13:32.030
Move in groups of three.

13:32.030 --> 13:33.370
Or we'll be dispersed.

13:33.930 --> 13:36.870
There are so many High Orcs
that can rival A-rank hunters alone.

13:37.290 --> 13:40.270
B-rank members cannot
handle these magic beasts.

13:45.450 --> 13:48.050
Please, let everyone survive.

13:57.950 --> 13:58.890
Next one.

13:59.270 --> 14:00.290
Don't move.

14:00.590 --> 14:01.990
I'll heal you right away.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.550
What just happened?

14:53.370 --> 14:54.290
What happened?

14:55.490 --> 14:57.710
These High Orcs suddenly…

14:58.870 --> 15:00.070
Now!

15:00.070 --> 15:01.470
Attack back!

15:02.170 --> 15:04.850
As an outsider, I really don't
want to stand out here.

15:05.210 --> 15:06.790
But I cannot watch people die.

15:13.350 --> 15:15.470
I must weaken them without being noticed.

15:18.990 --> 15:20.710
Don't play any tricks.

16:00.350 --> 16:01.790
Is anyone seriously injured?

16:02.070 --> 16:03.890
It seems okay.

16:04.330 --> 16:06.570
Everyone's alive. It's a miracle.

16:06.870 --> 16:07.830
Hey.

16:07.830 --> 16:09.790
Something weird happened
during the battle.

16:10.310 --> 16:13.170
I also felt that they
suddenly slowed down.

16:13.690 --> 16:15.430
Gina, was it you who did it?

16:15.970 --> 16:17.650
I couldn't do that.

16:17.650 --> 16:21.630
I only know attack magic and
a little bit of telekinesis magic.

16:22.230 --> 16:24.750
And the other members
mainly focus on firepower, right?

16:25.190 --> 16:27.050
Without assassin-type hunters,

16:27.050 --> 16:29.290
that shouldn't be possible.

16:29.910 --> 16:31.630
But, no matter what,

16:31.850 --> 16:33.090
we just won.

16:33.430 --> 16:34.690
Right.

16:34.990 --> 16:36.550
We're really lucky.

16:38.170 --> 16:39.470
That porter

16:39.690 --> 16:42.070
underestimated our assault team.

16:42.510 --> 16:43.950
With a magic caster on the team,

16:43.950 --> 16:46.990
how could he think that
his stealth skill wouldn't be detected?

16:48.050 --> 16:48.970
However,

16:48.970 --> 16:51.070
it's true that we survived because of him.

16:51.650 --> 16:54.610
It seems he has his reasons.
I'll let him off this time.

16:55.490 --> 16:56.810
Captain Son,

16:57.050 --> 16:58.510
do we keep going in?

17:00.570 --> 17:02.790
This place is too dangerous for us.

17:03.030 --> 17:04.910
We need at least two more healers

17:04.910 --> 17:07.210
and three more mages.

17:07.830 --> 17:10.830
I understand how you feel to encounter this
on your first time as the captain.

17:11.230 --> 17:11.910
But,

17:12.170 --> 17:13.870
I also think we should retreat first.

17:18.010 --> 17:19.950
I can understand
he doesn't want to give up.

17:20.750 --> 17:22.710
Everyone wants to conquer the dungeon.

17:23.350 --> 17:24.110
But,

17:24.330 --> 17:25.810
if he is a wise leader…

17:26.910 --> 17:27.630
Then,

17:28.630 --> 17:30.410
let's retreat for now.

17:33.150 --> 17:35.870
I was afraid you would
wanted us to keep going.

17:36.210 --> 17:38.070
I'm not that foolish.

17:39.790 --> 17:41.150
This is…

17:41.770 --> 17:42.950
A barrier.

17:43.250 --> 17:44.450
And a high-level one.

17:45.110 --> 17:46.830
It wasn't here when we entered.

17:47.450 --> 17:48.330
Is there a way to lift it?

17:48.990 --> 17:50.790
Given some time, I can do it.

17:52.250 --> 17:56.150
There's an entity capable of
using such high-level magic in this dungeon.

17:57.030 --> 17:58.670
Fortunately, we chose to turn back.

17:58.970 --> 18:02.110
We can't conquer this place by ourselves.

18:04.770 --> 18:06.550
What's this magic power?

18:06.930 --> 18:08.150
No way.

18:08.150 --> 18:09.510
The dungeon boss?

18:09.830 --> 18:11.590
We need to lift it, help me.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.430
Understood.

18:12.430 --> 18:13.150
Okay.

18:13.670 --> 18:16.890
Even a B-rank hunter can feel
such a powerful magical fluctuation.

18:17.450 --> 18:19.690
Why wasn't it detected outside the gate?

18:26.010 --> 18:27.670
Curse magic, is it a trap?

18:28.150 --> 18:29.950
Semi, cast divine magic.

18:31.490 --> 18:33.030
What's wrong? What are you doing?

18:40.370 --> 18:41.430
Captain Son.

18:41.430 --> 18:43.180
There are roughly fifty of them.

18:44.550 --> 18:45.910
-Kihoon.
-Don't move.

18:47.130 --> 18:49.370
We'll die pointlessly
if we fight them here.

18:55.930 --> 18:58.310
Helelakkohina.

18:58.630 --> 19:00.890
Vitualanaka.

19:01.690 --> 19:03.850
Helelakkohina.

19:04.170 --> 19:06.770
Vitualanaka.

19:07.410 --> 19:09.370
Helelakkohina.

19:09.850 --> 19:12.290
Vitualanaka.

19:13.070 --> 19:15.610
Helelakkohina.

19:15.610 --> 19:17.930
Vitualanaka.

19:18.530 --> 19:20.490
Humans.

19:21.170 --> 19:23.410
My name is Kargalgan.

19:23.730 --> 19:26.610
I wish to see you humans.

19:27.490 --> 19:28.490
Kargalgan.

19:28.770 --> 19:30.710
Did you block the entrance?

19:31.410 --> 19:32.890
Yes.

19:33.230 --> 19:36.950
I am the great sorcerer
of the glorious orc tribe.

19:36.950 --> 19:40.770
Is there a stronger being
than you in the cave?

19:43.130 --> 19:46.530
Who do you think can surpass me?

19:47.090 --> 19:48.550
Choose.

19:48.910 --> 19:50.930
Either die at the hands of my soldiers,

19:50.930 --> 19:53.690
or come to see me.

19:56.730 --> 19:57.790
We will come to see you.

20:05.810 --> 20:06.990
Hunter Sung.

20:07.590 --> 20:08.390
Yes.

20:10.330 --> 20:13.870
As soon as we see the boss,
we will attack immediately.

20:14.250 --> 20:16.730
No matter what, it should be distracted

20:16.730 --> 20:18.550
and cannot maintain the barrier.

20:18.890 --> 20:21.930
You take the opportunity to escape
and find the main assault team.

20:22.570 --> 20:24.390
Are you trying to get killed?

20:25.990 --> 20:29.670
Our mission is not to
return alive from the dungeon,

20:29.910 --> 20:31.490
but to close the gate.

20:32.190 --> 20:34.050
I also have a favor to ask of you.

20:35.230 --> 20:36.990
This is my short will.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.150
Please pass it on to my family.

20:40.370 --> 20:43.670
We must complete our mission.

20:44.090 --> 20:45.750
But you are different.

20:46.330 --> 20:48.610
Please make sure you leave here alive.

20:49.630 --> 20:51.570
This desperate situation

20:51.950 --> 20:54.060
is just like ours in the double dungeon.

20:55.010 --> 20:56.430
Those people back then…

20:57.790 --> 20:59.790
But these people…

21:00.490 --> 21:02.290
I'll take it for now.

21:02.650 --> 21:04.410
But I hope things don't turn out that way.

21:11.790 --> 21:13.210
He isn't here.

21:13.670 --> 21:16.030
Did he resign from the mining team?

21:17.190 --> 21:18.330
Hunter Cha.

21:19.530 --> 21:22.010
Why did you come?
Isn't today your day off?

21:22.370 --> 21:23.390
May I ask

21:23.390 --> 21:25.730
if Hunter Sung Jinwoo was here?

21:26.150 --> 21:28.090
Ah, Sung.

21:28.710 --> 21:31.190
He just went in as a porter.

21:31.610 --> 21:33.070
Eh?

21:33.530 --> 21:35.830
You mean he's inside the gate now?

22:02.130 --> 22:03.970
Humans.

22:06.750 --> 22:08.810
Welcome.
