WEBVTT

00:07.153 --> 00:10.573
<i>An E-rank hunter volunteered
to be a porter in an A-rank dungeon.</i>

00:11.199 --> 00:13.493
<i>He doesn't have multiple lives to waste.</i>

00:14.452 --> 00:15.829
<i>What is he thinking?</i>

00:17.121 --> 00:18.623
<i>Come to think of it,</i>

00:18.706 --> 00:21.709
<i>I saw him yesterday standing in front of
the BOSS room, seemingly with a weapon.</i>

00:22.502 --> 00:23.419
<i>He's suspicious.</i>

00:24.629 --> 00:26.965
- I'm going in to take a look.
- Eh?

00:27.048 --> 00:29.425
Anything happened inside?

00:29.509 --> 00:31.970
No. Just personal business.

00:32.053 --> 00:33.429
There's no need to worry.

00:34.514 --> 00:35.598
Ah.

00:38.059 --> 00:40.979
Sorry. Could I borrow a weapon?

00:41.062 --> 00:42.188
Eh?

00:42.814 --> 00:43.940
Hmm...

00:45.400 --> 00:46.442
Well...

00:46.526 --> 00:49.028
Anything besides this?

00:49.112 --> 00:50.864
Like swords or spears?

00:50.947 --> 00:52.866
We don't have that kind of stuff here.

00:52.949 --> 00:55.285
Otherwise it's just
iron shovel or crowbar.

00:55.368 --> 00:56.744
Then never mind.

00:56.828 --> 00:57.871
I'll just go in.

01:00.248 --> 01:03.710
Hunter Cha. Are you sure
you'll go in empty-handed?

01:07.046 --> 01:10.884
This is better than going in unarmed.

01:10.967 --> 01:11.843
Then I'm going.

03:08.042 --> 03:09.377
So many of them.

03:09.460 --> 03:12.296
If these High Orcs were to go outside...

03:12.380 --> 03:15.925
They could easily
raze cities to the ground.

03:16.509 --> 03:17.885
Especially those four.

03:18.553 --> 03:21.556
Compared with the others,
their aura is completely different.

03:28.021 --> 03:30.148
<i>Our mission is to close the gate.</i>

03:30.773 --> 03:33.860
<i>We must defeat the dungeon BOSS here.</i>

03:35.403 --> 03:37.905
Humans.

03:39.490 --> 03:40.992
Are you fearing me?

03:44.370 --> 03:46.039
<i>How could it be...</i>

03:46.122 --> 03:48.541
<i>It possesses tremendous magic power.</i>

03:49.125 --> 03:50.501
<i>Compared to that thing,</i>

03:50.585 --> 03:53.546
<i>I'm simply a third-rate Mage.</i>

03:54.964 --> 03:58.468
Why... Why did you bring us here?

03:58.551 --> 04:00.053
You are the entertainment.

04:00.136 --> 04:01.262
Eh?

04:01.888 --> 04:04.182
I want to kill you off one by one,

04:04.265 --> 04:09.228
torment, and devour you
to entertain my soldiers.

04:11.314 --> 04:12.148
Entertainment?

04:12.857 --> 04:15.526
<i>Our resolve is merely entertainment to it.</i>

04:16.402 --> 04:18.363
<i>To them, our lives</i>

04:19.197 --> 04:22.825
<i>are just toys to be discarded?</i>

04:23.451 --> 04:24.619
Oh.

04:24.702 --> 04:27.997
Among those humans
sneaked in something strange.

04:28.081 --> 04:31.167
But that's fun.

04:32.585 --> 04:33.961
Everyone, attack!

04:46.057 --> 04:47.683
Hymn of Protection.

04:52.605 --> 04:54.399
Fools.

04:54.482 --> 04:56.109
Gravitation Magic.

04:59.112 --> 05:00.863
Gravity Acceleration.

05:02.865 --> 05:03.741
Captain!

05:09.872 --> 05:10.790
Kihoon.

05:20.967 --> 05:22.218
Captain Son.

05:22.301 --> 05:24.679
This dungeon belonged to Hunters.

05:24.762 --> 05:27.140
So I'm not supposed to interfere.

05:27.223 --> 05:31.352
But, now the entire assault team
is in danger.

05:33.729 --> 05:35.356
I only ask you one thing.

05:40.361 --> 05:43.948
Can you leave all
the magic beasts here to me?

05:48.619 --> 05:51.205
Please...

05:53.291 --> 05:55.168
How arrogant.

05:55.251 --> 05:58.296
I know your strength.

06:03.259 --> 06:04.468
Indeed.

06:04.552 --> 06:07.346
It's my first time
feeling such a strong presence.

06:07.430 --> 06:09.056
Of course.

06:09.765 --> 06:12.768
It's just a pity that
we are naturally opposed.

06:13.436 --> 06:14.520
Of course.

06:19.609 --> 06:22.486
I will defeat you.

06:27.491 --> 06:28.492
Hm?

06:29.118 --> 06:30.119
Surveillance Department?

06:30.203 --> 06:32.246
What's Surveillance Department doing here?

06:32.330 --> 06:33.831
How would I know?

06:33.915 --> 06:36.584
Someone needs to call the leader over.

06:36.667 --> 06:39.045
Why does he work as a miner here?

06:39.128 --> 06:40.171
And for two consecutive days?

06:40.254 --> 06:42.048
May I ask what brings you here?

06:42.673 --> 06:45.176
Do you know where Hunter Sung Jinwoo is?

06:45.259 --> 06:46.761
Sung?

06:46.844 --> 06:48.596
I knew it.

06:48.679 --> 06:50.640
Something is wrong with that guy.

06:50.723 --> 06:54.060
He stared at me with those scary looks.

06:54.143 --> 06:57.063
I thought he was about to kill me.

06:57.146 --> 06:58.689
So where is Hunter Sung?

06:59.315 --> 07:00.983
He's in the gate now.

07:01.067 --> 07:04.362
The assault team had no porters,
so he went in to help.

07:04.445 --> 07:06.280
- Porter?
- Yes.

07:06.364 --> 07:08.699
<i>- A porter after a miner?</i>
- That must be an excuse.

07:08.783 --> 07:09.825
That guy must be up to something.

07:09.909 --> 07:11.202
<i>- After becoming an S-rank Hunter,</i>
- Maybe he's killed

07:11.285 --> 07:12.203
<i>- everything he does</i>
- someone inside.

07:12.286 --> 07:13.120
<i>- is under surveillance.</i>
- He's the kind that could kill

07:13.204 --> 07:14.038
without batting an eye.

07:14.121 --> 07:15.498
<i>I wish he would be conscious
of his actions.</i>

07:16.082 --> 07:17.458
- Um, may I ask...
- He must have killed people before.

07:17.542 --> 07:19.460
Watch the news tomorrow.
You should understand then.

07:19.544 --> 07:20.419
News?

07:21.087 --> 07:23.422
- But just now, Hunter Cha
- Who cares about the darn news?

07:23.506 --> 07:25.383
- asked the same question as you.
- Just arrest him!

07:25.967 --> 07:27.134
Hunter Cha?

07:29.971 --> 07:33.057
What was that strange aura?

07:33.140 --> 07:35.309
I thought I was going to be torn apart.

07:35.393 --> 07:36.602
Do the magic power test again.

07:37.186 --> 07:38.062
Yes!

07:44.652 --> 07:45.778
I need to hurry up.

07:46.279 --> 07:51.033
I don't know how Kihoon's team
managed to kill so many High Orcs.

07:52.285 --> 07:55.204
But if that power just now
came from the Dungeon Boss,

07:56.789 --> 07:58.708
they would be in mortal danger.

08:00.209 --> 08:03.838
Confronting my army
with your meager force.

08:03.921 --> 08:05.506
How naive.

08:06.132 --> 08:08.968
You'll regret underestimating us.

08:10.636 --> 08:12.680
Activate skill: Monarch's Domain.

08:13.472 --> 08:18.603
This is a new job skill I learned
after reaching level 70 in Demon's Castle.

08:19.186 --> 08:23.524
The Shadow Soldiers became stronger
after the battle at Demon's Castle.

08:23.608 --> 08:25.693
What is going on?

08:25.776 --> 08:27.194
Unbelievable.

08:27.278 --> 08:29.989
I can only summon two at most.

08:30.615 --> 08:32.950
Such ominous magic power from a human...

08:35.494 --> 08:36.370
Go.

09:05.941 --> 09:07.026
That move he just did...

09:07.109 --> 09:09.195
He's just like Vice Master...

09:09.904 --> 09:12.573
Why would someone so strong
come here to work as a porter?

09:14.659 --> 09:16.744
<i>The infantry's strength is about
that of B-rank hunters.</i>

09:18.120 --> 09:21.499
<i>Soldiers suffer destruction four
to five times to kill one High Orc.</i>

09:22.416 --> 09:24.251
<i>I must reduce the number of orcs.</i>

09:24.335 --> 09:26.003
Hymn of the Fire Dragon.

09:30.049 --> 09:33.260
Your soldiers are useless.

09:33.344 --> 09:34.845
Don't be too arrogant.

09:35.513 --> 09:37.682
Say that to yourself.

09:38.557 --> 09:41.060
These soldiers can resurrect infinitely.

09:41.727 --> 09:43.229
Hymn of Protection.

09:43.312 --> 09:44.814
Accelerate.

09:48.901 --> 09:50.277
Gravity Acceleration.

09:52.822 --> 09:54.949
Gravitation Magic.

09:55.032 --> 09:56.450
Accelerate.

09:59.870 --> 10:01.038
Then,

10:01.122 --> 10:03.833
I will keep destroying them
before your magic power runs out,

10:04.417 --> 10:06.085
until they are completely eradicated.

10:06.877 --> 10:08.754
Hymn of the Blazing Fire.

10:18.514 --> 10:21.267
<i>Does it intend to keep me at bay with its
formidable magic power</i>

10:21.350 --> 10:23.310
<i>and long-range large area spells?</i>

10:23.936 --> 10:25.104
Alright.

10:25.187 --> 10:28.023
I am eager to see how long you can last.

10:29.734 --> 10:31.235
The results are out!

10:31.318 --> 10:34.780
The strength of this A-rank gate
is extremely close to that of S-rank gate.

10:34.864 --> 10:36.449
A mistake in detection of magic power?

10:37.158 --> 10:39.201
Contact the Master of Hunters.

10:39.702 --> 10:43.164
We will get ready
to support the assault team inside.

10:43.247 --> 10:44.457
Yes... Yes.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.084
It seems

10:47.168 --> 10:50.963
both in number and strength,
my soldiers surpass yours.

10:51.964 --> 10:55.509
MP Your magic power
will run out sooner or later.

10:56.719 --> 10:58.596
Sooner or later?

10:58.679 --> 10:59.597
What nonsense is that?

11:04.852 --> 11:07.229
The true skill of necromancer
begins only now.

11:08.147 --> 11:09.231
Arise.

11:09.315 --> 11:10.232
Hm?

11:11.317 --> 11:13.903
You turned my soldiers into the undead...

11:14.778 --> 11:17.656
Before long, you too
will become my shadow.

11:18.240 --> 11:19.617
Of course,

11:20.659 --> 11:21.619
you too.

11:27.208 --> 11:28.584
Could it be that

11:29.710 --> 11:31.128
he is

11:32.171 --> 11:33.047
the lord...

11:36.091 --> 11:37.510
In that case,

11:37.593 --> 11:39.178
then why am I...

11:39.261 --> 11:40.721
Why am I here?

11:41.514 --> 11:44.225
When I opened my eyes here,

11:44.308 --> 11:48.479
the same command kept echoing in my mind.

11:50.064 --> 11:52.316
Hunt humans.

11:54.985 --> 11:57.821
The reason isn't important.

11:57.905 --> 12:00.658
Just obey the command.

12:03.035 --> 12:03.994
Go.

12:04.078 --> 12:06.664
Eliminate those who stand in the way

12:06.747 --> 12:10.417
and bring their corpses before me.

12:12.211 --> 12:14.004
Equivalent to S-rank gate?

12:14.088 --> 12:16.173
If the original
detection results were right,

12:16.257 --> 12:20.302
Hunter Son Kihoon should
have been able to conquer it.

12:20.386 --> 12:21.720
This was completely unexpected.

12:21.804 --> 12:23.472
If the gate has Dungeon Break,

12:23.556 --> 12:24.932
the Jeju Island incident
will happen again.

12:25.015 --> 12:27.393
Fortunately, we still have time.

12:27.977 --> 12:31.438
Mobilize all
of Hunters' forces to that gate.

12:33.399 --> 12:37.486
An emergency assembly has been issued
to all A-rank and above hunters.

12:37.987 --> 12:39.530
In the worst-case scenario,

12:39.613 --> 12:43.784
maybe we'll have to ask White Tiger Guild
and Fiend Guild for support.

12:43.867 --> 12:45.077
But then...

12:45.661 --> 12:49.039
We can only do our best
to prevent it from worsening.

13:20.321 --> 13:23.324
My generals are gaining the upper hand.

13:23.991 --> 13:26.285
How can this be?

13:26.869 --> 13:29.204
- Let's go help them.
- Yeah.

13:29.288 --> 13:31.665
Hymn of Agony, Hymn of Blindness.

13:33.125 --> 13:36.503
Audiences aren't allowed on stage.

13:37.546 --> 13:42.760
I will make sure that your arrogant mouth
can never make a sound again.

13:43.260 --> 13:46.555
Hymn of Slumber, Hymn of Lethargy.

13:46.639 --> 13:48.641
Hymn of Blindness.

13:48.724 --> 13:49.808
What?

13:51.101 --> 13:52.519
It's a pity.

13:52.603 --> 13:55.064
Poison and curses have no effect on me.

13:56.440 --> 13:58.400
Hymn of Protection.

14:00.986 --> 14:03.530
I will shatter your annoying shield.

14:24.218 --> 14:25.386
What is going on?

14:26.387 --> 14:30.432
Did he summon
such a large group of soldiers?

14:30.516 --> 14:31.809
Vice Master.

14:33.727 --> 14:34.603
Why are you here?

14:35.145 --> 14:37.982
How is he? The captain is fine.

14:38.065 --> 14:39.191
That's good.

14:40.609 --> 14:43.070
What's the situation now?

14:43.153 --> 14:45.280
To be honest, we're not too sure either...

14:45.864 --> 14:47.908
Quite capable, aren't you?

14:47.992 --> 14:51.912
Hymn of Rage,
Hymn of Strengthening, Hymn of Giants.

14:52.788 --> 14:57.001
I will crush you like a bug.

14:59.003 --> 15:00.462
Heck.

15:01.046 --> 15:03.215
I don't like giants.

15:03.966 --> 15:05.426
I have bad memories of them.

15:06.010 --> 15:07.886
Hymn of the Fire Dragon.

15:25.446 --> 15:30.576
Do you still think
you can go up against me?

15:30.659 --> 15:31.910
Hmm.

15:40.335 --> 15:43.464
Growing in size only makes you
a more obvious target.

15:44.840 --> 15:46.216
How could a Mage without guards

15:46.300 --> 15:49.470
withstand an assassin-type
hunter's attack?

15:51.555 --> 15:53.891
Hymn of the Blazing Fire.

16:07.488 --> 16:09.364
<i>As expected, the dagger
couldn't inflict damage.</i>

16:10.532 --> 16:11.700
<i>So...</i>

16:31.678 --> 16:32.679
Chief Woo.

16:33.639 --> 16:35.682
Is everyone okay?

16:35.766 --> 16:37.935
I felt a strong magic power outside.

16:38.018 --> 16:39.853
So I came in to support the assault team.

16:41.146 --> 16:43.982
But it seems that was unnecessary.

16:44.608 --> 16:46.735
<i>Even the chief
of the surveillance department...</i>

16:47.694 --> 16:50.697
<i>He must be a top-tier Fighter.</i>

16:50.781 --> 16:52.574
<i>But he can even use summoning magic.</i>

16:53.909 --> 16:57.246
<i>This is the power of Hunter Sung.</i>

16:57.871 --> 16:59.581
Who is he?

17:00.290 --> 17:02.251
You know him, right?

17:03.252 --> 17:05.003
Only a little.

17:07.214 --> 17:08.715
I don't know much.

17:10.259 --> 17:12.177
From the moment the Mage lost his guards,

17:12.803 --> 17:14.888
the outcome was already decided.

17:14.972 --> 17:16.723
My body...

17:17.391 --> 17:19.935
My body will not be destroyed.

17:20.602 --> 17:24.982
Absolutely not!

17:42.666 --> 17:44.209
The BOSS was defeated,

17:44.293 --> 17:46.837
but it doesn't feel right
to take all the items.

17:46.920 --> 17:50.507
However, Shadow Extraction should be fine.

17:51.133 --> 17:52.092
Arise.

17:58.432 --> 18:01.393
You are much more docile
after turning into a shadow.

18:02.895 --> 18:04.104
Name?

18:04.605 --> 18:06.106
What was its name again?

18:06.190 --> 18:07.774
Something like Kar...

18:08.358 --> 18:10.986
Sorry, I forgot.
I'll just pick one for you.

18:11.695 --> 18:12.696
Kiba.

18:12.779 --> 18:15.282
Your name will be Kiba.

18:16.533 --> 18:18.035
<i>Elite Knight Rank.</i>

18:18.118 --> 18:19.578
<i>I've never seen that rank before.</i>

18:20.162 --> 18:22.789
<i>The shadow extracted from an A-rank
Dungeon BOSS is amazing.</i>

18:24.499 --> 18:27.544
<i>These High Orcs are also a major gain.</i>

18:29.379 --> 18:30.297
Hunter Sung Jinwoo.

18:31.465 --> 18:32.466
<i>Chief Woo!</i>

18:32.549 --> 18:35.677
<i>I was so engrossed in extracting
that I didn't even notice him.</i>

18:35.761 --> 18:37.095
Mr. Sung.

18:37.179 --> 18:38.472
Mr. Porter.

18:38.555 --> 18:39.806
What happened just now?

18:40.474 --> 18:41.391
Um...

18:41.475 --> 18:42.768
<i>How should I explain this?</i>

18:44.186 --> 18:46.271
We are from the Surveillance Team
in Hunter's Association.

18:46.939 --> 18:49.650
Hunter Sung Jinwoo,
who is in front of you,

18:49.733 --> 18:51.526
is our Association's top secret.

18:52.527 --> 18:56.448
We ask everyone present
to keep today's events confidential.

18:57.074 --> 18:58.867
We will escort you out.

18:58.951 --> 19:02.412
This is the best way to avoid trouble.

19:04.039 --> 19:05.832
Hunter Sung

19:05.916 --> 19:10.337
has displayed the power
of an S-rank hunter to protect all of you.

19:10.420 --> 19:13.882
Please cooperate, so he can leave safely.

19:17.844 --> 19:19.137
Please wait.

19:20.472 --> 19:23.517
You possess such immense power.

19:23.600 --> 19:26.395
I think you must have your own reasons.

19:27.020 --> 19:30.023
I won't ask why you took
on the role of Porter.

19:31.400 --> 19:32.693
But,

19:32.776 --> 19:36.154
only because of you,

19:36.238 --> 19:37.322
we were able to survive.

19:38.323 --> 19:41.285
On behalf of my team,
I express my gratitude.

19:46.456 --> 19:47.958
Ah, right.

19:48.750 --> 19:50.377
Here's your will.

19:50.460 --> 19:51.461
Huh?

19:53.505 --> 19:54.840
Then, let's get going.

19:57.968 --> 20:00.137
- Ah...
- Vice Master.

20:00.220 --> 20:01.096
Yes?

20:01.179 --> 20:04.558
- Why are you holding a pickaxe?
- Huh?

20:06.476 --> 20:09.021
Would he think I'm weird?

20:09.104 --> 20:10.689
Who are you referring to?

20:10.772 --> 20:12.024
Ah... no one...

20:12.107 --> 20:13.525
I'm not referring to anyone.

20:16.361 --> 20:19.489
Fortunately, everyone came back safely.

20:20.198 --> 20:21.158
Having said that,

20:21.241 --> 20:25.954
following the White Tiger Guild,
we also received his help.

20:26.830 --> 20:28.999
He can summon a large number of soldiers.

20:29.082 --> 20:31.126
His speed rivals that
of an assassin-type hunter.

20:31.209 --> 20:33.462
He even has the ability
to control dead magic beasts.

20:34.087 --> 20:36.089
It's really hard to believe.

20:37.507 --> 20:40.218
Hunter Son,
between Hunter Sung Jinwoo and me,

20:40.302 --> 20:42.637
who do you think is stronger?

20:46.141 --> 20:50.979
Raid missions are usually handled
by multiple hunters doing their part,

20:51.063 --> 20:53.648
complementing each other's weaknesses.

20:53.732 --> 20:55.817
That's the common sense.

20:57.361 --> 21:01.656
Master, if you're facing
the most difficult A-rank dungeon,

21:01.740 --> 21:04.284
could you deal with it alone?

21:05.869 --> 21:07.746
No.

21:07.829 --> 21:12.084
It seems that my title
of The Ultimate Hunter has become a joke.

21:13.835 --> 21:15.212
Master.

21:15.295 --> 21:17.047
I understand.

21:17.130 --> 21:18.673
Please make sure to...

21:19.257 --> 21:21.051
I will do my best.

21:26.515 --> 21:27.891
Jinwoo.

21:30.685 --> 21:32.312
Sorry, I'm late.

21:32.896 --> 21:35.190
The matter of the guild master,
how did it go?

21:36.024 --> 21:37.567
You must have talked to your dad about it.

21:39.152 --> 21:40.278
Jinwoo.

21:40.904 --> 21:43.407
To be honest, that thing...

21:44.574 --> 21:45.867
We're right outside
the Hunter's Association now.

21:45.951 --> 21:47.494
That's really nice.

21:47.577 --> 21:49.329
Actor Lee Minsung has awakened
the power of a hunter recently.

21:49.413 --> 21:52.124
These people
must have come to interview me.

21:52.833 --> 21:56.128
Lee Minsung, the man who has it all,

21:56.211 --> 22:00.090
now possesses strength that
surpasses human capabilities?

22:00.799 --> 22:01.758
Well...

22:02.551 --> 22:03.927
Doesn't feel bad.
