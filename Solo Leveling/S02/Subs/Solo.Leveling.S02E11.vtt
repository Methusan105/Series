WEBVTT

00:07.111 --> 00:07.987
<i>Huh?</i>

00:14.369 --> 00:15.245
There's something there.

00:15.870 --> 00:16.830
Watch out!

00:16.913 --> 00:17.914
I know.

00:19.707 --> 00:20.583
This one...

00:22.127 --> 00:23.336
Kenzo!

00:29.217 --> 00:30.176
Got you.

02:20.745 --> 02:23.873
<i>Each one has S-rank strength.</i>

02:24.624 --> 02:25.625
<i>But,</i>

02:27.794 --> 02:29.671
<i>no matter how strong,
they are still magic beasts.</i>

02:29.754 --> 02:31.422
Their movements are monotonous.

02:31.506 --> 02:34.717
<i>Facing hunters with various tactics,</i>

02:35.301 --> 02:36.761
<i>they are no match at all.</i>

02:58.658 --> 03:00.785
The ants' exoskeletons are really tough.

03:00.868 --> 03:02.120
Right.

03:02.203 --> 03:04.580
Luckily, there aren't many of them.

03:04.664 --> 03:06.749
No need to worry even if there are.

03:06.833 --> 03:09.210
I will support you from the rear.

03:09.293 --> 03:10.586
Rest assured.

03:11.170 --> 03:14.298
Never thought someone
afraid of fighting would say that.

03:15.133 --> 03:18.511
No more sarcasm, Yoonho.

03:19.178 --> 03:20.972
Is this your first mission?

03:21.055 --> 03:23.057
Don't forget,

03:23.141 --> 03:25.435
these magic beasts can still live
for a while with their heads blown off.

03:26.185 --> 03:29.147
You should at least cripple them.

03:29.230 --> 03:30.898
Oh. Okay.

03:32.108 --> 03:34.902
The enemies get stronger as we go deeper,

03:34.986 --> 03:37.613
but we still haven't seen
any ants walking on two legs.

03:37.697 --> 03:39.449
Yeah, I think those are the ones

03:39.532 --> 03:42.493
arranged to be the queen ant's guards.

03:42.577 --> 03:45.246
In other words,
we still have a long way to go.

03:45.330 --> 03:47.248
Are we sure this is the right direction?

03:47.332 --> 03:49.375
It is. Probably.

03:49.459 --> 03:50.460
Hey.

03:50.543 --> 03:51.961
The direction is right.

03:52.045 --> 03:55.923
There's a strong smell of powerful
magic beasts coming from deep in the cave.

03:56.007 --> 03:58.676
Oh my, at this distance,

03:58.760 --> 04:01.471
President Baek's ability
should allow him to see it, right?

04:02.555 --> 04:03.723
Geez.

04:19.030 --> 04:20.073
<i>Is that it?</i>

04:24.327 --> 04:26.788
The queen ant
is in the deepest place ahead.

04:26.871 --> 04:29.040
There are many guards protecting her.

04:29.791 --> 04:33.878
The decoy unit outside has its limits.

04:34.629 --> 04:38.383
Also, there are many S-rank guards ahead.

04:38.466 --> 04:40.259
The strength of the queen ant is unknown.

04:40.343 --> 04:42.345
It will probably be a tough fight.

04:42.428 --> 04:45.348
But with our lineup,
we will definitely win.

04:47.100 --> 04:48.601
Let's go.

04:48.684 --> 04:49.519
- Yes!
- Yes!

04:55.733 --> 04:57.026
Is it around here?

04:57.110 --> 05:00.488
I wanted to check on Charlie
since we lost contact.

05:00.571 --> 05:02.407
Where on earth did they go?

05:03.825 --> 05:06.661
<i>They did kill ants here.</i>

05:08.204 --> 05:09.455
<i>Hm?</i>

05:09.539 --> 05:11.416
<i>These are Fujishima's glasses...</i>

05:12.208 --> 05:13.835
<i>Are they...</i>

05:18.214 --> 05:19.173
What's wrong?

05:19.841 --> 05:22.969
<i>What's this?
What is this smell that hits me?</i>

05:23.678 --> 05:27.390
<i>I've never smelled
anything like this before.</i>

05:44.157 --> 05:45.825
Did you reach Charlie?

05:45.908 --> 05:47.743
Not yet.

05:47.827 --> 05:49.287
Is there a problem?

05:49.370 --> 05:51.455
We don't have time
to worry about others now.

05:54.167 --> 05:56.419
This time you have to be serious.

05:56.502 --> 05:58.296
No other choice, huh?

06:04.844 --> 06:08.222
What a grand welcome.

06:10.308 --> 06:14.520
Then we must also show proper courtesy.

06:22.236 --> 06:24.071
Let's proceed as planned.

06:24.155 --> 06:27.909
I'm counting on you,
the ultimate weapon of mankind.

06:27.992 --> 06:29.619
I understand.

06:30.244 --> 06:31.871
Your opponent is here.

06:41.005 --> 06:44.133
I usually don't use such strong power.

06:45.218 --> 06:48.095
But it seems today I have to
use all my trump cards.

06:58.064 --> 07:01.776
<i>That's right. No need to hold back.</i>

07:01.859 --> 07:04.403
<i>Even if I must turn into an ugly form,</i>

07:05.196 --> 07:09.617
<i>I'll kill every last one of these insects.</i>

07:20.962 --> 07:22.129
<i>That is</i>

07:23.548 --> 07:25.633
<i>President Baek's magic beast form.</i>

07:28.135 --> 07:29.637
<i>The battle has started.</i>

07:30.429 --> 07:32.765
<i>Viewership has surpassed 80 percent.</i>

07:32.848 --> 07:34.767
<i>Go forward a bit more,
and get a clearer shot.</i>

07:34.850 --> 07:37.645
<i>380 percent of the viewership?</i>

07:37.728 --> 07:39.272
<i>I must meet their expectations.</i>

07:41.315 --> 07:43.943
This is the BOSS room
of an S-rank dungeon.

07:44.026 --> 07:45.403
Are you out of your mind?

07:45.486 --> 07:47.613
No, of course not.

07:47.697 --> 07:49.282
Please stay behind me.

07:50.032 --> 07:51.742
The battle will become even more intense.

07:54.120 --> 07:55.204
Look, everyone.

07:55.288 --> 07:58.958
<i>The S-rank hunters have
finally reached the queen ant.</i>

07:59.041 --> 08:00.960
<i>Now is the time to fulfill
our long-cherished wish.</i>

08:01.043 --> 08:03.462
<i>A fierce battle unfolds before your eyes.</i>

08:04.088 --> 08:07.008
These S-rank hunters
who usually don't fight together

08:07.091 --> 08:10.469
are showcasing perfect teamwork
in this joint offensive.

09:15.076 --> 09:18.329
<i>Hunter Cha's sharp strike
pierced through the ant.</i>

09:20.081 --> 09:21.666
<i>It's down.</i>

09:22.333 --> 09:24.335
<i>The last guard ant is killed.</i>

09:34.845 --> 09:37.348
Now is the time, attack!

09:40.267 --> 09:42.061
Take this.

09:49.819 --> 09:51.862
The queen ant without guards

09:51.946 --> 09:53.739
is just a living target.

10:10.423 --> 10:12.550
As long as I'm here,
no matter how many times,

10:12.633 --> 10:14.218
I will make you all stand up again.

10:20.307 --> 10:23.060
<i>I won't let you get close to the healer.</i>

10:23.644 --> 10:25.521
Please subdue it like this.

10:43.622 --> 10:46.250
Does it still have such strong power?

10:49.545 --> 10:50.755
<i>Is it a dying scream?</i>

10:50.838 --> 10:52.339
<i>No, it's not quite the same.</i>

10:53.883 --> 10:55.384
- Don't run away.
- You can't escape.

11:02.475 --> 11:03.476
- Hunter Cha!
- Miss Cha!

11:03.559 --> 11:04.727
I'm going up.

11:06.687 --> 11:07.688
Another hit.

12:01.575 --> 12:02.409
It's done!

12:05.913 --> 12:07.164
Master.

12:09.875 --> 12:12.753
Did we finally succeed?

12:13.963 --> 12:16.048
It's over... right?

12:16.549 --> 12:17.758
Yes.

12:17.841 --> 12:21.804
With the queen ant dead, the remaining
ants will naturally go extinct in a year.

12:21.887 --> 12:24.932
Then this place will become
a habitable area for humans again.

12:25.015 --> 12:27.476
But its final scream...

12:27.560 --> 12:29.812
What are you talking about?

12:29.895 --> 12:31.939
We killed that queen ant!

12:32.690 --> 12:35.359
We got revenge for Eunseok!

12:44.201 --> 12:45.494
Yeah.

12:49.748 --> 12:51.041
We have a problem.

12:51.125 --> 12:53.335
The ants are heading towards the nest.

12:53.419 --> 12:56.046
<i>What? The interference wave has no effect.</i>

12:57.464 --> 12:58.591
What's happened?

12:59.550 --> 13:01.343
Collect information and report back to me.

13:09.435 --> 13:12.479
The flame prison has been broken.

13:13.981 --> 13:15.608
What's going on?

13:15.691 --> 13:17.776
This is much faster than expected.

13:17.860 --> 13:19.778
The queen ant's scream.

13:19.862 --> 13:20.696
Is it...

13:20.779 --> 13:21.864
Calling for its companions?

13:21.947 --> 13:23.657
But even if it is,

13:23.741 --> 13:26.327
the ants outside can't
break Master's techniques.

13:26.410 --> 13:27.328
Then what exactly is...

13:27.411 --> 13:28.329
<i>Something is approaching.</i>

13:50.517 --> 13:52.311
<i>Black ant.</i>

14:00.319 --> 14:03.238
<i>A chilling sense of oppression.</i>

14:03.322 --> 14:04.907
<i>And this smell...</i>

14:04.990 --> 14:05.949
<i>What is this?</i>

14:06.033 --> 14:09.411
<i>That is not an ordinary magic beast.</i>

14:09.495 --> 14:11.705
<i>There's no time.</i>

14:11.789 --> 14:12.623
<i>If we don't kill it...</i>

14:19.004 --> 14:20.798
<i>It just walked past.</i>

14:58.877 --> 14:59.753
Miss Cha...

15:02.923 --> 15:03.799
Don't underestimate me!

15:30.576 --> 15:31.952
<i>Take this.</i>

15:34.788 --> 15:35.873
<i>It took it?</i>

15:44.965 --> 15:46.759
Be amazed.

15:46.842 --> 15:49.094
We have a reliable companion.

15:49.178 --> 15:52.681
<i>The skill to protect oneself, camouflage.</i>

15:52.765 --> 15:55.809
<i>After using this skill,
I become invisible.</i>

15:55.893 --> 15:57.519
<i>Although I'm immobile during use,</i>

15:58.270 --> 16:00.397
<i>this is enough for a healer.</i>

16:00.481 --> 16:03.484
<i>As long as I'm here,
our team will never lose.</i>

16:17.414 --> 16:19.792
<i>I did use camouflage.</i>

16:19.875 --> 16:20.918
<i>Does it mean...</i>

16:22.669 --> 16:23.796
Byung-gu!

16:34.556 --> 16:36.642
Byung-gu!

16:37.392 --> 16:38.560
Yoonho...

16:39.269 --> 16:40.312
Run away.

17:05.671 --> 17:08.173
Yoonho...

17:09.925 --> 17:12.136
Run away!

17:14.930 --> 17:18.725
Yoonho.

17:20.060 --> 17:21.520
Run away!

17:22.646 --> 17:24.439
You wretch...

17:25.649 --> 17:29.027
You all are too weak.

17:29.903 --> 17:35.617
Our queen ant is dead.

17:35.701 --> 17:40.914
Just killing soldiers is not fair.

17:40.998 --> 17:45.919
Where is your king?

17:46.503 --> 17:47.880
King.

17:51.008 --> 17:55.262
There is a strong one outside.

18:03.228 --> 18:04.563
Outside...

18:04.646 --> 18:06.231
Is it referring to Goto?

18:06.315 --> 18:08.817
No, there's no time to think now.

18:08.901 --> 18:11.862
We need to leave here quickly.

18:14.114 --> 18:16.617
<i>Darn. Have the other ants returned too?</i>

18:19.578 --> 18:20.621
Something's not right.

18:21.288 --> 18:25.500
Not just Charlie,
even Delta has become unreachable.

18:25.584 --> 18:27.586
It might be poor reception.

18:27.669 --> 18:30.547
But they should be
within the communication range.

18:31.256 --> 18:32.799
Bravo, please respond.

18:33.383 --> 18:34.801
This is Bravo.

18:34.885 --> 18:37.512
<i>Can you contact Charlie and Delta?</i>

18:37.596 --> 18:40.974
No, we've lost contact
with them since earlier.

18:41.058 --> 18:43.477
<i>Do you want us to go over
and check on them?</i>

18:43.560 --> 18:45.687
We are on our way now.

18:45.771 --> 18:49.149
After you finish,
wait for me at the rendezvous point.

18:49.233 --> 18:50.567
<i>I understand.</i>

18:55.614 --> 18:56.782
How could it be...

18:59.368 --> 19:00.244
<i>It's me.</i>

19:00.953 --> 19:03.997
I didn't receive your scheduled contact.

19:04.081 --> 19:05.958
<i>There are casualties here.</i>

19:06.041 --> 19:07.292
Oh?

19:07.376 --> 19:09.544
That's quite unexpected.

19:09.628 --> 19:11.129
Didn't you order them
only to kill mutated magic beasts

19:11.213 --> 19:14.132
to avoid any risks?

19:14.216 --> 19:16.218
<i>They are simply too weak.</i>

19:16.885 --> 19:18.762
That is something you would say.

19:18.845 --> 19:19.930
Alright.

19:20.013 --> 19:23.183
With your abilities, missing a few people
shouldn't be an issue, right?

19:23.850 --> 19:26.895
<i>By the way, is the team over there
with the queen ant?</i>

19:26.979 --> 19:28.105
Yes.

19:28.188 --> 19:29.648
But just a moment ago,

19:29.731 --> 19:31.733
it was confirmed that
the interference waves have failed.

19:31.817 --> 19:34.903
All the ants outside
have returned to the nest.

19:34.987 --> 19:36.571
<i>Hmm...</i>

19:36.655 --> 19:39.866
<i>What do you think
their chances of survival are?</i>

19:39.950 --> 19:41.910
Given their strength,

19:42.619 --> 19:44.329
the chances are zero.

19:45.080 --> 19:46.873
Very well.

19:46.957 --> 19:51.670
Despite Japan's best efforts in support,
the allied forces were annihilated,

19:51.753 --> 19:53.964
so we had no choice
but to temporarily retreat.

19:54.047 --> 19:55.590
We will inherit their will

19:55.674 --> 19:58.093
and continue to advance towards
Jeju Island

19:58.176 --> 20:00.053
with the second assault team at sea,

20:00.137 --> 20:02.889
gradually weakening
the neighboring country's power

20:02.973 --> 20:06.518
to make our country the one
to conquer the S-rank gates.

20:06.601 --> 20:08.145
<i>It's about time.</i>

20:08.228 --> 20:09.646
<i>Everyone, retreat.</i>

20:09.730 --> 20:12.441
<i>Meet up with the second
assault team at sea.</i>

20:13.817 --> 20:14.735
Forget it.

20:15.777 --> 20:17.779
Chairman Matsumoto has given the order.

20:17.863 --> 20:18.989
We are retreating.

20:19.740 --> 20:20.949
We'll come back later
to retrieve the bodies.

20:26.455 --> 20:27.497
Ishida!

20:27.581 --> 20:28.957
Leave quickly.

20:29.041 --> 20:31.918
Join Bravo and meet up
with the second team.

20:32.002 --> 20:33.420
Prepare for the next offensive.

20:33.503 --> 20:34.671
But...

20:34.755 --> 20:36.965
You staying here will only get in the way.

20:38.467 --> 20:40.135
- Go.
- Understood.

20:43.472 --> 20:46.099
It has an extremely piercing aura.

20:46.850 --> 20:49.061
Are you the king?

20:50.187 --> 20:51.480
<i>Interesting.</i>

20:51.563 --> 20:53.023
<i>An ant can speak.</i>

20:55.150 --> 20:56.360
King...

20:56.443 --> 20:57.527
That's right.

20:57.611 --> 20:58.987
I am the king.

21:04.201 --> 21:05.952
<i>What is this magic power?</i>

21:06.036 --> 21:08.038
<i>This feeling...</i>

21:08.121 --> 21:10.290
<i>I have had it before.</i>

21:11.541 --> 21:12.667
<i>That is...</i>

21:22.386 --> 21:24.805
Choi Jong-in. Increase the firepower.

21:24.888 --> 21:27.182
Stop pushing me.
