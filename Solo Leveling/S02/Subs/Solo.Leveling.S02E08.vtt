WEBVTT

00:10.173 --> 00:11.382
I surrender!

00:12.508 --> 00:13.635
I surrender.

00:13.718 --> 00:14.886
Please spare my life.

00:16.679 --> 00:18.097
<i>That voice...</i>

00:18.181 --> 00:19.265
<i>Are you...</i>

00:27.482 --> 00:29.275
I'm... I'm sorry.

00:29.359 --> 00:30.985
We lost.

00:31.069 --> 00:33.196
Please spare me.

02:05.496 --> 02:08.666
You attacked us, and now
you want me to spare your life?

02:08.750 --> 02:11.085
I killed all your companions.

02:11.753 --> 02:14.547
It is the duty of a knight
to protect the lord.

02:14.630 --> 02:15.798
As long as I am safe,

02:15.882 --> 02:17.842
I'm sure they will be happy.

02:19.093 --> 02:21.054
<i>How could you say that...</i>

02:21.721 --> 02:23.014
Never mind.

02:28.936 --> 02:30.104
My chance!

02:36.444 --> 02:37.528
What's this supposed to mean?

02:37.612 --> 02:41.157
I will do anything
as long as you spare my life.

02:41.240 --> 02:42.825
So please show mercy.

02:42.909 --> 02:44.702
<i>This one...</i>

02:45.411 --> 02:49.165
Can you get the floor entry permit?

02:49.248 --> 02:50.875
The entry permit...

02:50.958 --> 02:53.336
It's currently being kept by my family.

02:53.419 --> 02:55.880
If you spare my life,
I can give it to you.

02:56.547 --> 03:00.051
I know the locations
of all the upper-level permits.

03:00.134 --> 03:03.513
If you can ensure the safety
of me and my family,

03:03.596 --> 03:04.597
I can take you there.

03:05.181 --> 03:07.809
So you hid them.

03:07.892 --> 03:10.812
No wonder I can't get them
by defeating opponents.

03:11.395 --> 03:12.730
But the question is...

03:14.774 --> 03:18.402
Can I trust you?

03:19.445 --> 03:21.114
Of course...

03:21.697 --> 03:25.326
I... I'm not lying to you.

03:27.912 --> 03:29.247
Alright.

03:29.330 --> 03:32.041
As long as I get the permit,
I will spare you.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.962
Thank... thank you very much.

03:36.796 --> 03:37.964
By the way,

03:38.714 --> 03:40.425
who are you people?

03:57.733 --> 04:00.570
I am Esil, the eldest daughter
of the Radiru family.

04:00.653 --> 04:03.865
No, that's not what I wanted to ask.

04:05.575 --> 04:07.118
<i>I thought I could get information</i>

04:07.201 --> 04:10.455
<i>about the system
from magic beasts other than Baruka...</i>

04:12.248 --> 04:13.958
In your minds,

04:14.041 --> 04:16.752
do you constantly hear voices
telling you to kill humans?

04:16.836 --> 04:17.962
Huh?

04:18.045 --> 04:20.465
Hmm... No.

04:20.548 --> 04:23.009
But we do hear another command.

04:23.092 --> 04:24.886
What command?

04:24.969 --> 04:26.804
Protect our space.

04:27.889 --> 04:28.764
Since when did it start?

04:28.848 --> 04:30.975
Since we came here.

04:31.058 --> 04:32.935
<i>Since you came here?</i>

04:33.519 --> 04:34.937
Where were you before?

04:35.021 --> 04:35.980
The Demon Realm.

04:36.063 --> 04:39.567
We found ourselves in this place
when we came to our senses one day.

04:40.276 --> 04:43.154
What were you doing in the Demon Realm?

04:46.073 --> 04:47.074
A war...

04:48.242 --> 04:50.536
We were preparing for a war.

04:50.620 --> 04:52.246
<i>A war?</i>

04:52.330 --> 04:53.581
Who were you going to fight?

04:54.582 --> 04:58.794
A formidable enemy who is so strong that
all the demons had to unite to fight.

04:59.378 --> 05:02.673
At that time, we were on the eve
of fighting that powerful enemy.

05:04.675 --> 05:07.011
This is not disclosable information.

05:07.094 --> 05:08.596
The conversation has been blocked.

05:08.679 --> 05:11.015
This is not disclosable information.

05:11.098 --> 05:12.600
The conversation has been blocked.

05:12.683 --> 05:13.935
This is not...

05:18.648 --> 05:20.691
<i>Seems I can't ask further questions.</i>

05:23.528 --> 05:26.906
Here is the disaster caused by
a winged ant magic beast

05:26.989 --> 05:29.575
landing on the Japanese outlying islands

05:29.659 --> 05:31.077
and its subjugation record.

05:31.953 --> 05:34.330
A total of 294 civilian casualties.

05:34.872 --> 05:38.000
108 hunters engaged in the battle.

05:38.084 --> 05:39.418
Among them,

05:39.502 --> 05:42.797
4 E-rank hunters, 1 C-rank hunter,
and 1 B-rank hunter died.

05:44.173 --> 05:46.759
Just one magic beast
caused such casualties...

05:47.426 --> 05:51.055
The A-rank hunter
who arrived later killed it.

05:51.138 --> 05:52.807
Only then was it subjugated.

05:52.890 --> 05:55.977
So, the strength
of the winged ant is A-rank.

05:57.144 --> 06:00.690
It's consistent with the conclusion
of the investigation department

06:00.773 --> 06:01.691
after dissecting the body.

06:04.735 --> 06:08.698
That island is 120 kilometers
from Jeju Island.

06:09.573 --> 06:12.868
If those ants gain
stronger flying ability,

06:12.952 --> 06:15.204
they can land
on the southern tip of our nation.

06:16.247 --> 06:18.708
Immediately request support from Japan.

06:19.458 --> 06:20.835
Warn neighboring countries

06:20.918 --> 06:23.713
- to be vigilant.
- Yes.

06:23.796 --> 06:25.881
What was bound to come is coming.

06:25.965 --> 06:27.675
Now every second counts.

06:27.758 --> 06:32.638
I wanted to strike first
before there were casualties.

06:33.222 --> 06:37.184
Now, as the president
of the Hunter's Association,

06:37.268 --> 06:40.730
I order to commence
the fourth Jeju Island raid mission.

06:42.690 --> 06:44.275
Sorry...

06:44.358 --> 06:47.570
I don't know why I fainted.

06:47.653 --> 06:49.739
No, it's okay.

06:50.364 --> 06:52.033
Do you feel unwell?

06:52.116 --> 06:54.285
No, I'm fine.

06:54.368 --> 06:56.245
You are worried about me.

06:56.996 --> 06:58.456
Sort of.

06:59.999 --> 07:02.626
By the way, are we almost there?

07:02.710 --> 07:04.295
Ah, yes.

07:04.378 --> 07:06.547
That is the castle
where the Radiru family resides.

07:06.631 --> 07:08.716
The permit is inside.

07:09.925 --> 07:12.428
Who did you bring back?

07:12.511 --> 07:14.388
- Esil!
- Eh?

07:14.472 --> 07:16.557
Didn't you see it?

07:16.641 --> 07:20.061
Those countless troops
lurking in that man's shadow.

07:20.144 --> 07:21.520
<i>Oh...</i>

07:21.604 --> 07:23.022
<i>He is very perceptive.</i>

07:23.105 --> 07:26.692
If you want to deceive my daughter
and then take over the castle,

07:26.776 --> 07:28.527
don't expect to get out alive.

07:28.611 --> 07:30.946
Father, wait.

07:31.030 --> 07:33.449
I have promised her.

07:33.532 --> 07:36.661
As long as you give me the permit,
I won't harm you.

07:39.205 --> 07:42.333
<i>I heard that he had defeated
Vulcan and Metus.</i>

07:42.416 --> 07:46.462
<i>That means he isn't
an opponent we can defeat.</i>

07:48.172 --> 07:49.548
Heck...

07:57.556 --> 07:59.100
I'll take it.

07:59.892 --> 08:02.978
So you're done, aren't you?

08:03.062 --> 08:04.647
Then leave quickly.

08:04.730 --> 08:06.107
There's one more thing.

08:07.441 --> 08:08.567
I need to borrow her.

08:08.651 --> 08:10.569
- Eh?
- What...

08:12.780 --> 08:15.574
Ah, no. I need her as a guide.

08:15.658 --> 08:18.786
She said she knows the locations
of the permits on each floor.

08:20.371 --> 08:21.914
Can you guarantee my daughter's safety?

08:21.997 --> 08:23.624
Yes.

08:26.335 --> 08:28.838
Alright then. I understand.

08:29.422 --> 08:32.007
That's it. Please show me the way, Esil.

08:32.091 --> 08:33.259
Okay.

08:45.646 --> 08:46.647
Guild master.

08:57.491 --> 08:58.325
Good.

08:58.409 --> 09:00.411
Now the 89th floor is completed.

09:02.413 --> 09:05.166
Igris and Tank have both leveled up.

09:06.959 --> 09:09.795
Their strength is about S-rank and A-rank.

09:09.879 --> 09:11.797
I'm also gaining combat power.

09:13.883 --> 09:15.176
Darn it...

09:15.259 --> 09:20.347
Now the gifts prepared
for negotiations are wasted.

09:20.431 --> 09:22.057
You can take them back.

09:22.141 --> 09:24.018
That's not possible.

09:24.101 --> 09:27.229
The floors above the 90th floor are
managed by high-ranking nobles.

09:27.980 --> 09:30.691
They are on a different level
than the lower ones.

09:31.275 --> 09:34.487
So, getting permits
through conversation might be more...

09:34.570 --> 09:37.114
If I were weaker than you,

09:37.615 --> 09:38.908
would you have a conversation with me?

09:40.409 --> 09:41.452
That's how things are.

09:42.453 --> 09:45.331
Aren't you competing in rankings
with other Demon Nobles?

09:46.123 --> 09:49.710
I will make the Radis family the first.

09:49.794 --> 09:52.963
It's Radiru... Wait.

09:53.047 --> 09:57.676
Jinwoo, why did you spare my family?

09:58.344 --> 09:59.887
Because I like you.

09:59.970 --> 10:02.097
Huh... What?

10:02.181 --> 10:04.141
<i>First it was Jinho, now it's Esil.</i>

10:04.725 --> 10:08.813
<i>I do get along well
with simple-minded people.</i>

10:09.605 --> 10:11.774
- Esil, you can go back.
- Eh?

10:11.857 --> 10:13.818
Eh?

10:13.901 --> 10:16.487
You said the next enemies
would be stronger.

10:17.071 --> 10:18.739
I also promised your father.

10:18.823 --> 10:21.242
Just tell me the location of the permits.

10:21.325 --> 10:23.410
I can handle the rest myself.

10:23.494 --> 10:26.288
Am I so useless to you?

10:26.372 --> 10:29.416
It's not like that.
I just think you must be tired.

10:30.167 --> 10:32.419
Thanks for everything. Thank you.

10:33.379 --> 10:35.756
I will follow you till the end.

10:35.840 --> 10:39.593
I want to see what kind of achievements
you will have.

10:41.262 --> 10:43.597
I understand. Then let's go.

10:45.391 --> 10:46.517
Yes.

10:50.312 --> 10:51.814
<i>As Esil said,</i>

10:51.897 --> 10:54.191
<i>the difficulty increased drastically
from the 90th floor.</i>

10:55.025 --> 10:57.403
<i>The strength and quantity
of the guardian magic beasts</i>

10:57.987 --> 11:00.072
<i>are completely different from before.</i>

11:00.739 --> 11:04.702
<i>But I'm still climbing
to the top step by step.</i>

11:05.995 --> 11:07.371
<i>I must</i>

11:07.454 --> 11:10.666
<i>get the materials for the Elixir of Life.</i>

11:10.749 --> 11:11.875
<i>For that...</i>

11:15.713 --> 11:20.384
Both Hunter Cha and I received a call
for the fourth Jeju Island raid mission.

11:20.467 --> 11:21.385
Yes.

11:21.468 --> 11:25.097
Besides us, it seems President Baek
from the White Tiger Guild

11:25.180 --> 11:29.602
and all S-rank hunters in the country
have also been called.

11:29.685 --> 11:31.812
<i>Then Hunter Sung too...</i>

11:31.895 --> 11:35.941
Moreover, it has been officially
decided to cooperate with

11:36.025 --> 11:37.776
neighboring country this time.

11:38.402 --> 11:40.779
- Do you mean Japan?
- Yes.

11:41.322 --> 11:43.657
Considering the flying ability
of the winged ants,

11:43.741 --> 11:46.118
they are also within the attack range.

11:46.201 --> 11:47.828
This is a natural decision.

11:49.330 --> 11:50.956
As long as they can be eliminated,

11:51.040 --> 11:53.250
it doesn't matter who does it.

11:54.793 --> 11:56.170
When do we take action?

11:56.253 --> 11:57.963
It has not been decided yet.

11:58.047 --> 12:00.507
But I think it will start soon.

12:01.091 --> 12:04.470
And, to discuss the battle plan,

12:04.553 --> 12:08.932
the hunters from ultra-large guilds
will come to our nation today.

12:13.479 --> 12:14.855
<i>I finally reached the top floor?</i>

12:15.439 --> 12:17.066
But there's no one here...

12:32.623 --> 12:35.209
<i>That is the lord of the demons,</i>

12:36.543 --> 12:37.544
<i>Baran.</i>

12:45.427 --> 12:47.304
<i>His aura is overwhelming.</i>

12:47.388 --> 12:49.223
<i>Can I defeat him?</i>

12:49.890 --> 12:52.309
<i>Feels like I'm about to be
dismembered by the killing intent.</i>

12:53.018 --> 12:55.187
<i>So strong that even Esil can feel it.</i>

12:55.896 --> 12:57.481
<i>Alright.</i>

12:57.564 --> 12:59.149
<i>It's hard to deal with it in the air.</i>

13:00.192 --> 13:02.945
<i>A flying dragon?
Are there non-demon creatures as well?</i>

13:27.928 --> 13:29.763
There are quite a lot of them.

13:30.347 --> 13:32.307
What... what should we do?

13:34.601 --> 13:35.477
Jinwoo!

13:36.103 --> 13:37.312
<i>I know.</i>

13:40.023 --> 13:41.275
Come out.

14:01.420 --> 14:02.838
That's amazing...

14:02.921 --> 14:05.591
Jinwoo can use
this kind of combat technique.

14:06.467 --> 14:09.261
But, that is the Demon Monarch Baran,

14:09.344 --> 14:10.596
the ruler of this place.

14:10.679 --> 14:13.432
Jinwoo is just an invader,

14:13.515 --> 14:15.059
someone to be eliminated.

14:16.018 --> 14:19.563
Which side should I choose?

14:49.468 --> 14:50.803
<i>This is not ordinary lightning.</i>

14:51.345 --> 14:53.472
<i>It's a wide-range attack
with a stun effect.</i>

14:54.556 --> 14:56.642
<i>Although the soldiers can be revived,</i>

14:56.725 --> 14:59.686
<i>if they keep getting hit by it,
my MP will soon run out.</i>

15:00.270 --> 15:01.647
<i>I must act before that.</i>

15:11.490 --> 15:13.158
<i>Start with the wings.</i>

15:14.660 --> 15:16.578
<i>My stealth was detected.</i>

15:25.712 --> 15:27.422
<i>It can track me.</i>

15:27.506 --> 15:29.341
<i>Darn it, I will be caught up.</i>

15:29.424 --> 15:30.968
Kiba, Igris!

15:57.870 --> 15:59.413
You finally came down?

16:00.330 --> 16:03.167
Looking up all this time
made my neck sore.

16:03.250 --> 16:04.209
This is much better.

16:12.676 --> 16:13.802
Nice to meet you all.

16:13.886 --> 16:17.181
I am Hanekawa from the Draw Sword Guild.

16:17.264 --> 16:20.058
This is the guild master, Goto Ryuji.

16:20.142 --> 16:23.645
He will communicate with you
through my translation.

16:24.229 --> 16:25.564
Draw Sword Guild.

16:26.148 --> 16:30.277
A super large guild in Japan
with eleven S-rank hunters.

16:30.903 --> 16:34.406
It's reputed to be
the second largest in Asia.

16:34.489 --> 16:35.782
And...

16:35.866 --> 16:38.827
Goto Ryuji, who manages the entire guild,

16:38.911 --> 16:41.580
does live up to the reputation
with his awe-inspiring aura.

16:42.497 --> 16:43.373
First of all,

16:43.457 --> 16:46.835
thank you for accepting the proposal
to form a joint assault team

16:46.919 --> 16:48.045
and work together.

16:48.128 --> 16:49.379
Please don't say so.

16:49.463 --> 16:52.674
We were the ones
who first requested support.

16:52.758 --> 16:54.635
We should thank you for your consent.

16:55.219 --> 16:57.095
As shown in the files,

16:57.179 --> 17:00.015
we have come to many conclusions

17:00.098 --> 17:02.893
from the information you provided

17:02.976 --> 17:04.937
and the dissection results
of the winged ants.

17:05.938 --> 17:06.897
Among them,

17:06.980 --> 17:09.858
there are two key points
related to this operation.

17:10.817 --> 17:11.985
One is its lifespan.

17:12.527 --> 17:15.405
Ants grow rapidly after hatching,

17:15.489 --> 17:17.324
but they only live for about a year.

17:17.407 --> 17:18.659
That means,

17:18.742 --> 17:20.369
as long as the queen ant is killed,

17:20.452 --> 17:23.538
the remaining ants will die after a year.

17:24.164 --> 17:27.042
The other is the ants' behavior patterns.

17:27.125 --> 17:29.628
From the records
of the past three raid missions,

17:29.711 --> 17:31.838
we found that ants

17:31.922 --> 17:35.509
are attracted by powerful enemies,
that is, strong magic power.

17:35.592 --> 17:39.721
This time, we will use this habit
to devise a combat plan.

17:40.973 --> 17:44.810
<i>We also noticed the ants' actions.</i>

17:44.893 --> 17:48.063
<i>I didn't know
they analyzed it so thoroughly...</i>

17:49.314 --> 17:50.565
As for this operation,

17:51.233 --> 17:55.237
among the eleven S-rank hunters
of Draw Sword Guild,

17:55.320 --> 17:58.031
ten will be dispatched, including me.

17:59.199 --> 18:00.909
Ten out of eleven...

18:01.493 --> 18:03.870
We will lure out all the ants.

18:03.954 --> 18:07.708
Your responsibility
is to kill the queen ant.

18:07.791 --> 18:10.877
But this way, you will have to
face thousands of ants...

18:11.461 --> 18:14.673
If we're only acting as bait,
this is not a problem.

18:14.756 --> 18:19.303
The AI simulation also indicates
that this is the best tactic.

18:20.053 --> 18:24.766
<i>Indeed, we can't mobilize
ten S-rank hunters...</i>

18:24.850 --> 18:26.226
<i>Well...</i>

18:26.310 --> 18:27.728
I understand.

18:27.811 --> 18:31.606
Then we will plan
the operation details based on that.

18:40.365 --> 18:42.743
<i>I have no chance
MP to restore MP with a potion.</i>

19:02.262 --> 19:03.889
<i>It blocked a vital hit.</i>

19:33.627 --> 19:35.337
<i>MP Is my MP depleted?</i>

20:19.131 --> 20:20.674
Darn it, the dagger...

20:31.393 --> 20:33.353
<i>It's too strong.</i>

20:35.188 --> 20:36.440
<i>No way.</i>

20:37.566 --> 20:38.400
<i>I can't dodge it.</i>

20:45.031 --> 20:46.032
<i>Now!</i>

20:46.116 --> 20:47.826
<i>As long as I have strength
that I've specially boosted</i>

20:47.909 --> 20:50.454
<i>and 'Ruler's Hand'...</i>

21:07.095 --> 21:10.140
<i>This is the end!</i>

21:24.237 --> 21:25.864
Jinwoo...

21:46.927 --> 21:48.053
Jinwoo!

21:48.136 --> 21:49.554
Esil.

21:49.638 --> 21:51.556
Go back and report to your father.

21:52.599 --> 21:53.642
From now on,

21:53.725 --> 21:56.061
the Radis family will be
at the top of the rank.

21:56.937 --> 21:58.063
Jinwoo.

22:02.067 --> 22:03.944
It's not Radis.

22:04.027 --> 22:05.195
It's Radiru.

22:05.275 --> 22:07.275
