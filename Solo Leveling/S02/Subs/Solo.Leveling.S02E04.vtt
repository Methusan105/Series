WEBVTT

00:11.620 --> 00:15.120
That's two of the three ingredients
I need for the Elixir of Life.

00:15.710 --> 00:17.580
Just one to go:

00:17.790 --> 00:20.690
the purified blood of the demon monarch.

00:20.690 --> 00:23.540
When I go for it,
I'll need to be fully prepared.

00:24.190 --> 00:27.760
I've leveled up a fair bit from
visiting the Demon's Castle.

00:27.760 --> 00:31.420
But officially, I'm still E-Rank.

00:31.420 --> 00:33.480
I might want to get stronger,

00:33.480 --> 00:36.590
but I won't be able to participate
in higher-level raids with that rank.

00:38.980 --> 00:41.650
I need to stop faking.

00:41.650 --> 00:44.230
And it's not like the truth
can stay secret forever.

00:45.490 --> 00:48.040
I'll get my hunter rank reassessed.

02:24.660 --> 02:29.420
The line for hunter rank
assessment is over here.

02:29.420 --> 02:33.380
I wonder what kind of personnel
we'll be able to recruit today.

02:33.800 --> 02:38.130
He looks like a C-Rank.
That one is a pretty obvious E-Rank.

02:38.130 --> 02:39.910
Beyond that...

02:43.310 --> 02:44.850
Yes, this is Baek Yoonho.

02:44.850 --> 02:46.910
This is Hyun Kichul from the
Second Administration Team!

02:46.910 --> 02:48.140
What can I do for you?

02:48.140 --> 02:49.480
He's here!

02:49.480 --> 02:51.280
Say that again?!

02:51.280 --> 02:53.290
I'm sure of it.

02:53.290 --> 02:56.600
Hunter Sung is here to have
his rank reassessed!

02:56.600 --> 02:58.490
Right this way, please.

02:58.490 --> 02:59.240
Sure.

02:59.240 --> 03:01.240
I'm heading there right now.

03:03.010 --> 03:05.210
You don't need to be nervous.

03:06.190 --> 03:09.030
The actual assessment is pretty simple.

03:09.670 --> 03:13.760
I need to get my hunter rank
sorted out so I can earn money.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.600
Maybe then, my ex-wife and
daughter will come back...

03:16.600 --> 03:18.140
Look there.

03:18.750 --> 03:24.350
If you get D-Rank or higher,
the scouts from the guilds will talk to you.

03:24.720 --> 03:28.560
Don't worry. As long as you're not E-Rank,
you can make a good living.

03:29.700 --> 03:32.520
"As long as you're not E-Rank," huh?

03:33.280 --> 03:34.720
Next!

03:34.720 --> 03:35.650
Coming.

03:37.740 --> 03:39.800
If I could get your name for confirmation?

03:39.800 --> 03:41.160
Sung Jinwoo.

03:41.160 --> 03:42.930
A reassessment, then?

03:42.930 --> 03:43.810
Right.

03:43.810 --> 03:47.180
The process is the same as before,

03:47.180 --> 03:49.880
so please hold your hand against
the black crystal and wait.

03:57.100 --> 03:57.960
Huh?

03:58.410 --> 03:59.440
An error?

04:00.080 --> 04:01.650
Pardon me. Could you do it again?

04:01.650 --> 04:02.650
Sure.

04:04.300 --> 04:06.010
That's odd...

04:07.390 --> 04:09.500
Hey, what's the problem?

04:09.500 --> 04:10.530
Chief...

04:11.790 --> 04:15.520
Something's strange. I keep trying,
but it's not able to evaluate him.

04:15.520 --> 04:18.240
That can't be right. Let me see.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.760
See what happens?

04:23.200 --> 04:24.410
Chief?

04:24.410 --> 04:26.750
It's not a malfunction.

04:27.160 --> 04:29.250
It's saying he <i>can't</i> be assessed.

04:29.250 --> 04:31.200
What's that mean?

04:31.200 --> 04:35.810
It means he's got more magic power
than can be measured with this machine!

04:35.810 --> 04:38.240
Huh? That'd mean...

04:38.240 --> 04:41.180
Right. He's the tenth person
ever in the country...

04:41.940 --> 04:43.380
to be S-Rank.

04:45.590 --> 04:48.290
Is there any news on the
winged ants from before?

04:48.740 --> 04:51.390
The intel department's
commenced their necropsy.

04:51.390 --> 04:54.770
They'll be comparing their biology and
trace magic power levels with past examples

04:54.770 --> 04:57.110
in order to see what's going on.

04:57.530 --> 05:01.000
The results will take a bit longer, though.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.320
I see.

05:02.320 --> 05:05.270
So many strange things lately...

05:05.270 --> 05:07.700
Like the red gate, for instance.

05:08.790 --> 05:12.090
Apparently an outsider who was participating
in the White Tiger Guild raid

05:12.090 --> 05:14.850
ended up beating the dungeon boss?

05:14.850 --> 05:16.240
Who exactly is he?

05:17.400 --> 05:21.960
I was present during the investigation,
but not the entire time.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.280
So I don't have all the details.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.960
That's a shame.

05:26.520 --> 05:29.850
Oh, something seems to be
going on over by the lobby.

05:30.410 --> 05:34.190
Most likely an awakened making a fuss
after having been assessed.

05:34.190 --> 05:35.450
I'll check it out.

05:37.150 --> 05:38.630
I'll join you.

05:39.470 --> 05:42.070
I'm curious about the commotion.

05:45.360 --> 05:47.350
He couldn't be assessed?!

05:47.350 --> 05:50.460
Seriously?! I wasn't sure that ever happened!

05:50.460 --> 05:51.830
Never seen anything like it...

05:50.460 --> 05:55.110
Unfortunately, the standard equipment can't properly assess you, Hunter Sung.

05:51.830 --> 05:55.110
Obviously! There's only been
nine hunters like that before.

05:55.110 --> 05:58.760
Would you mind coming back in three days?

05:55.110 --> 05:58.800
Then this guy is the tenth
S-Rank in the country?!

05:58.760 --> 06:00.150
Understood.

06:00.560 --> 06:04.720
It's just like Manager Ahn said!
I need to be the first one to talk to him...

06:05.050 --> 06:07.930
Once that's done,
you'll get your updated license.

06:08.610 --> 06:10.010
Something wrong?

06:10.830 --> 06:12.720
Hey, look!

06:15.600 --> 06:19.090
The head of the Hunters Guild, Choi Jong-in?!

06:19.930 --> 06:23.990
He who stands at the pinnacle of fire magic,

06:23.990 --> 06:26.460
the hunter known as the "ultimate weapon"...

06:26.940 --> 06:29.160
The counterpart to my old nickname.

06:29.680 --> 06:33.820
Well, that explains the commotion, then.

06:34.500 --> 06:35.950
It's a pleasure to meet you.

06:35.950 --> 06:40.120
My name is Choi Jong-in,
and I represent the Hunters Guild.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.510
Have you decided on a guild yet?

06:42.720 --> 06:45.120
I'd like to discuss it with you
if you're not busy.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.640
I am, sorry.

06:49.600 --> 06:50.990
No way!

06:50.990 --> 06:53.260
He just shot Guildmaster Choi down!

06:53.850 --> 06:59.230
Manager Woo, I did mention that I was Choi
Jong-in from the Hunters Guild, didn't I?

06:59.230 --> 07:00.940
Yes, I'm certain.

07:02.070 --> 07:05.370
It seems I've grown conceited.

07:06.010 --> 07:09.620
Hunter Sung... Then it's really true.

07:10.330 --> 07:13.100
And now he's gone without a trace.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.530
Maybe he's an assassin type?

07:17.610 --> 07:19.080
President Baek...

07:19.080 --> 07:20.500
President!

07:21.330 --> 07:23.640
I see how it is now.

07:23.640 --> 07:26.850
The White Tiger's office isn't far from here,

07:24.240 --> 07:25.340
Where is he?!

07:25.340 --> 07:29.430
He left as soon as he exited
the the assessment room!

07:26.850 --> 07:29.430
but he ran hard enough to be short of breath.

07:29.430 --> 07:31.600
I tried to call out to him, but...

07:30.070 --> 07:33.720
That's how badly he wanted to talk to him.

07:34.280 --> 07:38.690
Jackpot. This must be the outsider
who cleared the red gate.

07:40.930 --> 07:42.120
Jong-in.

07:50.750 --> 07:53.800
Of all the people to catch wind of this...

08:02.080 --> 08:05.130
She looks like she could
wake up at any moment.

08:13.170 --> 08:16.020
Just a bit longer now, Mom.

08:18.150 --> 08:22.110
It seems my eyes have failed me all this time.

08:22.110 --> 08:25.360
The surveillance team's job is to watch hunters

08:25.360 --> 08:27.980
and punish any who break the law.

08:28.680 --> 08:32.130
I'm usually confident about
my judgment, but this time...

08:32.130 --> 08:34.430
Do I need surveillance?

08:34.430 --> 08:36.370
Not the same way that a criminal might.

08:37.010 --> 08:41.250
The surveillance team is the only group
able to handle hunter-related incidents.

08:41.540 --> 08:45.530
But when dealing with S-Ranks,
even we're powerless.

08:46.590 --> 08:49.490
There's someone who'd like
to meet you, Hunter Sung.

08:58.520 --> 09:00.060
It's a pleasure.

09:00.060 --> 09:04.010
My name is Go Gunhee, and I'm the
chairman of the Hunter's Association.

09:05.750 --> 09:09.280
First of all, congratulations
on your S-Rank assessment.

09:10.560 --> 09:13.740
The reassessment is but
a formality at this point.

09:14.130 --> 09:18.750
From the moment you're confirmed to be
off the charts, you're S-Rank by definition.

09:18.750 --> 09:20.330
Why bother, then?

09:20.330 --> 09:24.330
With the formal reassessment?

09:24.850 --> 09:27.050
It's something of a grace period.

09:27.470 --> 09:32.260
It allows us to make contact
with individuals such as yourself.

09:32.600 --> 09:37.620
Sadly, despite our reach, the Association
does not have many skilled hunters.

09:37.620 --> 09:42.480
We can't really compete with large guilds
in terms of pay or fame.

09:42.930 --> 09:48.960
Manager Woo is one of our top-level hunters,
and even he's only A-Rank.

09:49.550 --> 09:51.730
I'll get to the point now.

09:52.850 --> 09:56.490
I would be thrilled if you could join us.

09:57.530 --> 10:01.420
I can prepare a key position
in the Association for you.

10:01.850 --> 10:03.220
Why go so far?

10:03.670 --> 10:07.480
The nation's greatest advocates right now
are not the government,

10:07.480 --> 10:10.800
but the hunters, who protect
the people from magic beasts.

10:10.800 --> 10:15.180
The core of which is the five largest guilds.

10:15.970 --> 10:17.730
In a sense, it's like five great dinosaurs

10:17.730 --> 10:20.990
maintaining a delicate stalemate
against each other.

10:20.990 --> 10:25.730
But should you join any of them,
that balance will collapse.

10:26.920 --> 10:31.400
The Hunter's Association is vital
to the nation as a deterrent to themâ€”

10:31.400 --> 10:33.730
a sixth power, essentially.

10:34.320 --> 10:36.280
And that's why you want me to join?

10:36.280 --> 10:39.240
You certainly possess the strength for the job.

10:39.760 --> 10:42.700
Perhaps even one day...

10:43.830 --> 10:45.570
So, what do you think?

10:46.290 --> 10:48.240
It's a good offer.

10:48.610 --> 10:53.050
A job inside of the Association
is basically a guaranteed career track.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.040
I doubt there's anyone with
greater reach than Chairman Go,

10:57.040 --> 11:00.300
especially with the press
and the government.

11:01.530 --> 11:06.610
Plus, he's an amazing hunter.
The first S-Rank to awaken in this country.

11:06.970 --> 11:08.830
He possesses overwhelming magic power

11:08.830 --> 11:11.460
and a physique that's makes it
hard to believe he's over 80.

11:12.090 --> 11:17.530
He's retired, yet he's on even footing
with me after all my efforts to level up.

11:18.920 --> 11:23.760
If I accept his offer, my life will change.

11:24.540 --> 11:26.120
Well, Hunter Sung?

11:29.000 --> 11:31.820
I'm sorry. I have to refuse.

11:34.030 --> 11:36.420
I suppose it all comes down to money, then.

11:37.320 --> 11:39.260
I want to fight, sir.

11:40.530 --> 11:44.840
You mean against magic beasts?

11:44.840 --> 11:49.060
Right. The dungeons are where I belong.

11:50.630 --> 11:54.760
Incredible. I can tell from his eyes
that he's not lying.

11:55.720 --> 11:59.440
How many years has it been
since I've felt this sensation?

12:00.090 --> 12:03.910
I'm impressed my heart can still
make these kinds of noises.

12:03.910 --> 12:09.620
If I were twentyâ€”no, ten years younger,
I could've stood aside someone like him.

12:12.670 --> 12:16.060
Understood. I won't press the issue.

12:16.060 --> 12:20.860
My sister is at home alone,
so I should get going.

12:21.730 --> 12:25.270
Thank you for your time.

12:28.330 --> 12:32.400
I remember how crestfallen I was
when I aged past the point

12:32.400 --> 12:35.020
that even an S-Rank healer
couldn't offset my decline.

12:37.070 --> 12:40.290
Cancel the rest of my schedule for today.

12:40.290 --> 12:43.040
I don't want anything to disrupt this feeling.

12:43.830 --> 12:47.320
Manager Woo, would you join me for a drink?

12:47.320 --> 12:50.920
As long as you don't mind
that I won't partake.

12:50.920 --> 12:52.130
Not a problem.

12:53.630 --> 12:56.160
I wonder if he likes to drink?

12:57.880 --> 13:01.920
The Association mostly handles
D and E-Rank dungeons.

13:01.920 --> 13:06.730
I need to level up as soon as possible
so that I can heal Mom.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.050
I don't have time to waste.

13:10.470 --> 13:12.980
Because I can keep growing!

13:33.750 --> 13:37.800
Come to rub salt in my wounds, Deputy Chief?

13:37.800 --> 13:40.720
Just had questions
I'd like to ask you in person.

13:41.370 --> 13:46.430
This Il-hwan Sung. Is he really a magic beast?

13:48.990 --> 13:51.430
Did he seem like a human to you?

13:53.400 --> 13:55.860
He sure as hell seemed like a beast to me.

13:57.730 --> 14:00.830
All right. Focus on your recovery, then.

14:00.830 --> 14:04.070
Drop by the command center
once you're discharged.

14:05.230 --> 14:06.410
Where is he?!

14:06.410 --> 14:08.490
The command center's tracking him down.

14:08.490 --> 14:13.490
But I doubt they'll be able to bring in
someone who was able to beat you.

14:18.100 --> 14:19.210
Shit!

14:20.070 --> 14:24.870
You'd better stay away from my family.
For your own sake.

14:25.530 --> 14:28.760
If you don't... even death
won't save you from me.

14:29.300 --> 14:31.820
What a humiliating loss...

14:31.820 --> 14:36.230
Even death won't save me?
Is that his idea of a threat?

14:36.870 --> 14:41.190
I know where he's headed.
Now I just need gear.

14:41.190 --> 14:44.910
An artifact that'll let me crush that bastard!

14:46.290 --> 14:50.730
Artifacts: a word that usually
refers to man-made relics.

14:50.730 --> 14:52.160
But in the world of hunters,

14:52.160 --> 14:56.670
artifacts are high-level gear that even
experienced craftsmen can't produce.

14:57.220 --> 14:59.330
With the increase in hunters,

14:59.330 --> 15:02.180
you can find them in online auctions
like anything else, but...

15:03.130 --> 15:05.790
Do they have to be so expensive?

15:06.970 --> 15:10.900
I want my gear to be flawless before
I take on the rest of the Demon's Castle.

15:10.900 --> 15:14.100
Nothing in the store seemed a good fit.

15:15.050 --> 15:18.780
The Sphere of Avarice can be transferred.
I should be able to sell it.

15:19.300 --> 15:24.530
Most of the best gear in circulation offers
a 20-30% increase in performance,

15:24.530 --> 15:27.850
but this sphere can double magic damage.

15:27.850 --> 15:29.990
And that means it'll fetch a high price.

15:30.690 --> 15:34.380
Which will raise the question:
how does an E-Rank like me have it?

15:34.740 --> 15:37.120
People are bound to try and
find out where it came from.

15:37.810 --> 15:41.290
If there was a record of me entering an
A-Rank gate, that'd serve as an excuse.

15:41.290 --> 15:44.840
But I can't join a raid like that as an E-Rank.

15:45.900 --> 15:48.790
Wait, someone's actually recruiting?

15:50.860 --> 15:53.190
This is our data from four years ago?

15:53.190 --> 15:56.350
His photo looks completely
different. Like a child.

15:57.030 --> 15:59.160
Is there a chance he
falsified his original rank?

15:59.820 --> 16:03.070
He's on the record as being
severely injured several times.

16:03.590 --> 16:05.370
That makes it unlikely.

16:05.730 --> 16:10.720
It's incredible that he held out
for so long, after so many raids.

16:11.090 --> 16:15.210
Paying for his mother's Eternal Sleep
treatment and his sister's tuition...

16:15.210 --> 16:17.790
He's been supporting his family
with his income.

16:18.060 --> 16:21.830
You don't see that kind of devotion
from young folks these days.

16:22.310 --> 16:27.220
There's been a report that Hunter Sung
has joined a Hunters Guild raid team.

16:28.270 --> 16:33.700
Then, in spite of what he said, he was
lured in by a lucrative signing bonus...

16:33.700 --> 16:38.190
From what the report says,
he's joined a mining team of theirs.

16:38.190 --> 16:39.790
A mining team?

16:39.790 --> 16:40.400
Yes, sir.

16:43.750 --> 16:46.590
He's certainly hard to predict, isn't he?

16:46.940 --> 16:48.650
So, you're E-Rank?

16:48.650 --> 16:49.580
Yes, sir.

16:49.580 --> 16:50.900
You do much excavation before?

16:50.900 --> 16:52.180
This is my first time.

16:52.180 --> 16:56.490
Then you're a combat type? Shouldn't
have to worry about your fitness, then.

16:57.020 --> 17:00.310
We've got plenty of folks like you, Mr. Sung.

17:00.310 --> 17:02.790
Just relax, and let's work hard!

17:02.790 --> 17:03.960
Right.

17:03.960 --> 17:08.420
Major raids that take place in high-level
dungeons demand a degree of specialization.

17:09.070 --> 17:11.750
You have the strike team
that deals with magic beasts,

17:11.750 --> 17:15.180
the mining team that collects
the mana crystals in the dungeon,

17:15.180 --> 17:18.140
and the collection team that
recovers the beast carcasses.

17:19.380 --> 17:21.820
It's a lot of personnel,
but the profits justify it.

17:23.210 --> 17:24.980
I bet right now, inside the dungeon...

17:26.820 --> 17:28.720
Back up, please.

17:28.720 --> 17:31.770
They don't seem to appreciate the light.

17:51.840 --> 17:53.180
Tanks...

17:55.570 --> 17:57.310
If you would, please.

18:10.050 --> 18:12.990
The carcasses aren't of much use
if they're cooked to well-done,

18:12.990 --> 18:14.910
so I tried to keep it at medium.

18:15.650 --> 18:19.040
I believe that takes care of most
of the nearby enemies.

18:19.040 --> 18:20.710
Let's move on.

18:21.340 --> 18:25.540
I know one of us has a sensitive nose,
so do mind the smell of burning beasts.

18:26.950 --> 18:29.130
The strike team's coming out!

18:30.070 --> 18:32.840
Then everything but the
dungeon boss is dead already?

18:33.290 --> 18:36.830
I could sense he was strong
during our encounter yesterday,

18:37.290 --> 18:40.070
but for everyone to emerge from an
A-Rank gate without a scratch...

18:40.070 --> 18:42.060
just goes to show how strong.

18:42.060 --> 18:45.520
And there's the Hunters Guild
second-in-command.

18:48.300 --> 18:49.570
That's her...

18:50.210 --> 18:55.530
The vice guild master of the Hunters Guild,
and the ninth S-Rank hunter in this country.

18:56.430 --> 18:58.870
Cha Hae-in, the Dancer.

18:59.540 --> 19:01.070
Incredible...

19:01.940 --> 19:05.900
I have to wonder how many people
in the world have that much aura.

19:09.990 --> 19:13.090
I thought I just sensed
something incredible...

19:13.090 --> 19:14.510
Was I imagining it?

19:14.510 --> 19:17.900
For a second, I thought
Chairman Go was around.

19:17.900 --> 19:20.800
But now there's no trace of whoever it was.

19:23.290 --> 19:25.390
She's even sharper than I thought.

19:25.390 --> 19:28.190
All right, everyone! Let's get moving!

19:28.190 --> 19:30.310
All righty...

19:28.490 --> 19:33.820
With the strike team's work finished,
it's the mining and collection teams' turn.

19:30.310 --> 19:33.000
One... two...!

19:34.970 --> 19:45.990
One, two!

19:37.350 --> 19:39.530
It's looking a little loose here!

19:44.610 --> 19:47.710
There's a magic power signal
coming from deeper in the dungeon.

19:48.670 --> 19:52.000
Must be the A-Rank dungeon boss giving it off.

19:53.650 --> 19:57.220
It's stronger than Vulcan and Metis
from the Demon's Castle.

19:58.110 --> 20:03.990
I'm tempted to find out for myself
how strong an A-Rank boss really is.

20:03.990 --> 20:07.380
Did you hear? The guy who joined
for this job is an E-Rank.

20:07.380 --> 20:09.060
E-Rank? Are you kidding me?

20:09.060 --> 20:11.560
What the hell was the boss thinking?

20:12.810 --> 20:16.930
No matter where you go,
E-Ranks get the same treatment.

20:16.930 --> 20:19.300
Not that I intend on doing this for long.

20:19.300 --> 20:22.080
Come on, let's get a move on!

20:22.080 --> 20:24.900
It's tight enough in here!
You can't just stand aroundâ€”

20:25.990 --> 20:30.520
Uh, well... P-Please take your time.

20:31.550 --> 20:34.640
Is that dude seriously E-Rank?

20:36.410 --> 20:40.600
Chief... Is he really E-Rank?

20:40.600 --> 20:41.740
Yeah.

20:41.740 --> 20:44.360
He seems... super strong, though?

20:44.360 --> 20:50.020
I get the feeling Mr. Sung is God's gift
to blue-collars like us.

20:52.350 --> 20:54.350
Okay, break time.

20:54.350 --> 20:56.150
Let's all go get something to eat.

20:56.150 --> 20:57.380
Right.

20:57.380 --> 20:59.580
You coming, Mr. Sung?

20:59.580 --> 21:01.430
I just want to finish up here first.

21:01.430 --> 21:02.910
Understood.

21:02.910 --> 21:05.600
Don't go too far in, though.

21:05.600 --> 21:06.670
Sure.

21:16.930 --> 21:18.750
I'm finally alone.

21:18.750 --> 21:21.320
I can't let this chance slip by.

21:21.320 --> 21:25.160
Break time lasts an hour... Let's take a peek.

21:29.370 --> 21:31.440
This must be the boss chamber.

21:32.190 --> 21:34.700
Definitely seems stronger than Metis.

21:35.940 --> 21:39.690
I realize that I shouldn't defeat this boss.

21:40.470 --> 21:42.540
If I do, the gate closes,

21:43.270 --> 21:46.150
at a huge loss to the Hunters Guild.

21:47.170 --> 21:51.380
Still... A little poke can't hurt.

21:51.380 --> 21:53.620
What are you doing there?

21:59.420 --> 22:01.130
I'll ask again.

22:01.900 --> 22:04.230
What do you think you're doing?
