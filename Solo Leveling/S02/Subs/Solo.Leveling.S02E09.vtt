00:09.700 --> 00:13.450
SOLO LEVELING SEASON 2
-ARISE FROM THE SHADOW-

01:37.010 --> 01:39.150
Purified Blood of the Demon Monarch.

01:39.650 --> 01:41.310
Now I have everything I need.

01:45.040 --> 01:49.090
The rate of success and quantity
depend on intelligence level?

01:50.050 --> 01:52.270
Jinwoo, are you alright?

01:55.920 --> 01:56.760
Craft.

02:16.990 --> 02:18.990
The Elixir of Life is complete.

02:19.490 --> 02:24.280
But, will this cure
my mother's Eternal Slumber?

02:29.210 --> 02:31.870
Iron, you're unusually
quick-witted today.

02:34.720 --> 02:35.850
Arise.

02:47.650 --> 02:49.010
The name...

02:49.560 --> 02:52.520
Kesslin... Kekalin...

02:52.520 --> 02:53.820
What was its name again?

02:53.820 --> 02:57.690
Jinwoo, you're terrible
at remembering names.

02:57.690 --> 02:58.780
Well, whatever.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.280
Your name...

03:00.910 --> 03:01.910
...shall be 'Kaisel.'

03:07.460 --> 03:10.000
With this dragon,
we'll return home in no time.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.170
Let's hold a party when we return!

03:12.170 --> 03:14.150
My father will be delighted!

03:15.880 --> 03:17.550
- Umm...
- I want to test

03:17.550 --> 03:19.300
- Hey!
- the elixir's effects immediately.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.850
Are you listening?

03:20.850 --> 03:23.520
- We're having a party!
- Right, there's a rune stone in the reward.

03:23.520 --> 03:24.720
A joyous party!

03:24.720 --> 03:25.430
No...

03:26.730 --> 03:28.230
Not this either.

03:28.230 --> 03:29.520
Ermm...

03:30.270 --> 03:31.730
Ah, here it is.

03:38.070 --> 03:39.740
Shadow Exchange...

03:40.200 --> 03:44.830
Does this mean I can switch places with
my Shadow Soldiers wherever they are?

03:45.250 --> 03:46.120
In that case...

03:48.080 --> 03:50.790
Sorry, Esil, you go back alone.

03:50.790 --> 03:52.420
Huh? What about the party?

03:52.420 --> 03:55.170
The Radis family lives on the 80th floor.

03:55.170 --> 03:57.050
It's too far for a detour.

03:57.050 --> 03:58.640
No way...

03:59.590 --> 04:01.390
Let's meet again if fate allows.

04:01.930 --> 04:02.980
Take care.

04:03.470 --> 04:05.600
Jinwoo, I...

04:06.570 --> 04:07.180
Hmm?

04:08.760 --> 04:09.810
Huh?

04:21.320 --> 04:24.220
I really switched places
with the patrol soldiers.

04:25.370 --> 04:27.950
It takes three hours
before I can reuse it.

04:27.950 --> 04:29.750
Then the remaining journey...

04:31.330 --> 04:32.250
Kaisel.

04:38.630 --> 04:42.340
We'll use Hunters' magical power as bait
to lure out the ants.

04:42.340 --> 04:46.100
Then use special interference waves
to disrupt their sensory communication.

04:46.600 --> 04:50.690
The special forces will seize
this chance to infiltrate the nest

04:50.690 --> 04:53.310
and eliminate the queen ant, huh?

04:53.940 --> 04:57.400
The issue is whether the interference
waves will work properly.

04:59.570 --> 05:03.200
It'd be a lie to say I don't feel uneasy.

05:03.200 --> 05:07.120
However the investigation results are accurate,
and the conclusions align with ours.

05:07.620 --> 05:12.750
We've also established a retreat plan
if the interference wave fails.

05:14.290 --> 05:16.590
What we should do...

05:16.590 --> 05:20.880
...is to make thorough preparations
to send Hunters to that island.

05:21.340 --> 05:22.290
Yes.

05:22.880 --> 05:24.010
Additionally...

05:24.680 --> 05:26.970
Have you been able
to contact Hunter Sung?

05:26.970 --> 05:28.520
Not yet.

05:30.980 --> 05:32.770
Yoonho.

05:32.770 --> 05:36.440
We rarely go drinking, so cheer up.

05:36.440 --> 05:39.110
That was funny, wasn't it?

05:40.030 --> 05:42.860
Byung-Gu, I don't understand at all.

05:42.860 --> 05:45.450
Frowning will make you age faster.

05:45.450 --> 05:46.740
Mind your own business!

05:49.740 --> 05:52.260
S-Rank healer, Min Byung-Gu.

05:52.260 --> 05:57.000
He is one of the few Hunters in the world
who retired young with all limbs intact.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.550
He's also my life-and-death companion.

06:02.010 --> 06:06.880
Just like his weird sense of humor,
he remains an eccentric.

06:08.010 --> 06:09.760
Since when are you so tactful?

06:09.760 --> 06:10.720
Yoonho.

06:12.560 --> 06:14.140
Are you really going?

06:15.270 --> 06:16.020
Yeah.

06:17.900 --> 06:20.110
You saw how Eunseok died.

06:24.860 --> 06:26.220
That's exactly why I must go.

06:28.030 --> 06:32.580
If we let those ants run wild,
the whole country will soon become like that.

06:33.130 --> 06:35.870
Since when were you so patriotic?

06:35.870 --> 06:40.670
I have to go either way,
so I might as well do it for a good reason.

06:44.760 --> 06:48.050
He said the same thing just like you.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.020
I'm not going. Never.

06:52.470 --> 06:53.810
If you came to invite me, thenâ€”

06:53.810 --> 06:55.680
I came to say goodbye.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.940
I might not be able to see you again.

07:00.650 --> 07:03.900
I plan to take the civil service exam.

07:03.900 --> 07:05.570
The civil service exam?

07:06.240 --> 07:10.030
I don't want to see any more blood.

07:11.660 --> 07:13.470
That's why I want to be a civil servant.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.230
But I'm only good at history.

07:16.230 --> 07:17.460
So the exam might be tough.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.960
Are you good at history?

07:19.960 --> 07:22.960
You know how much
I love historical dramas, right?

07:22.960 --> 07:24.170
Do you?

07:24.760 --> 07:27.150
But that's how normal life should be.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.720
Battles should remain confined to history.

07:31.510 --> 07:33.720
Yes, you are right.

07:34.640 --> 07:36.810
It's Hunters who are not normal.

07:37.520 --> 07:38.850
Come to think of it,

07:38.850 --> 07:43.320
I haven't met many Hunters
who hate fighting magic beasts.

07:43.900 --> 07:46.280
Fighting has become routine now.

07:46.280 --> 07:48.030
Some even enjoy it...

07:49.070 --> 07:51.950
Could it be, that's the condition
for awakening...

07:51.950 --> 07:53.030
Yoonho.

07:53.030 --> 07:56.000
You're frowning again.

07:56.460 --> 07:57.460
Shut up and drink!

07:58.620 --> 08:00.790
Very sly, Your Excellency.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.380
Why are you speaking like that?

08:29.780 --> 08:31.780
That burn mark was my fault.

08:44.040 --> 08:46.090
She might not be able to drink it.

08:46.880 --> 08:50.300
Even if she does,
no one knows what will happen.

08:51.300 --> 08:52.010
But...

08:53.430 --> 08:56.770
I've witnessed countless miracles
from the system.

08:57.680 --> 09:00.000
Including that I grew so much
from E-Rank.

09:04.150 --> 09:05.690
I'll trust it.

10:04.370 --> 10:05.290
Mom.

10:10.510 --> 10:13.340
Please open your eyes.

10:14.220 --> 10:17.430
I keep fighting and growing for you.

10:20.970 --> 10:22.520
Please wake up...

10:23.310 --> 10:24.310
Mom...

10:29.070 --> 10:32.460
I couldn't focus all day...
Why is that?

10:42.950 --> 10:44.650
The wind feels warm.

11:17.030 --> 11:18.110
You're Jinwoo...

11:18.110 --> 11:19.390
Right?

11:22.120 --> 11:24.800
How long was I asleep?

11:27.250 --> 11:28.290
Four years.

11:28.750 --> 11:29.870
You slept for four years.

11:30.380 --> 11:31.500
How is Jinah?

11:33.500 --> 11:34.640
She's good.

11:38.550 --> 11:40.390
Thank you, Jinwoo.

11:41.510 --> 11:44.100
You kept your promise.

11:46.940 --> 11:49.020
You've become so mature.

11:49.690 --> 11:51.870
But you're covered in wounds.

11:52.440 --> 11:55.950
You must have pushed
yourself too hard, right?

12:00.900 --> 12:02.310
It must have been tough for you.

12:10.880 --> 12:11.960
It's nothing...

12:12.670 --> 12:13.880
I'm fine...

12:16.420 --> 12:17.660
I'm fine...

12:29.390 --> 12:30.560
Thank you.

12:31.730 --> 12:32.760
Jinwoo.

12:39.320 --> 12:40.000
Yes...

12:42.830 --> 12:44.990
The patient with Eternal Slumber
has awoken?!

12:44.990 --> 12:47.370
Yes, I know it's hard to believe.

12:47.830 --> 12:51.500
Moreover, the patient's body
shows no abnormalities.

12:51.500 --> 12:55.630
The patient and their family
want to be discharged immediately.

13:00.590 --> 13:03.050
Jinah, you've grown so much.

13:03.970 --> 13:05.660
Mom...

13:09.890 --> 13:12.670
I'm sorry for worrying you.

13:13.860 --> 13:16.170
All my efforts have been rewarded.

13:16.690 --> 13:20.430
I've finally received the real reward.

13:24.370 --> 13:28.130
Thank you all for gathering here today.

13:28.620 --> 13:33.670
As you all know,
disasters are now occurring nationwide

13:33.670 --> 13:38.010
due to winged ant magic beasts
from Jeju Island.

13:38.010 --> 13:41.300
In response to this situation,
the Hunter's Association...

13:41.300 --> 13:45.510
...has decided to initiate
the "4th Jeju Island Raid Mission."

13:46.050 --> 13:50.220
This operation will involve
not only domestic S-Rank Hunters

13:50.610 --> 13:55.400
but also 10 S-Rank Hunters from Japan.

13:55.940 --> 13:58.980
Hunters of A-Rank and below

13:58.980 --> 14:01.940
will handle maritime surveillance
and homeland defense

14:01.940 --> 14:07.330
to jointly support this operation
and protect other members.

14:08.450 --> 14:12.250
This time, we are determined to succeed.

14:17.670 --> 14:19.050
Eunseok...

14:19.420 --> 14:21.710
To be honest, I'm scared.

14:22.220 --> 14:23.970
Me too.

14:25.430 --> 14:30.600
But those who can't fight
must be far more scared than us.

14:31.100 --> 14:32.020
We'll end this.

14:32.520 --> 14:35.100
This is something only
we can accomplish.

14:35.690 --> 14:38.860
We can't let this country
become an ant nest.

14:39.360 --> 14:40.320
Darn it!

14:41.690 --> 14:44.350
I'll crush those things
with my bare hands...

14:46.200 --> 14:48.570
Yoonho is someone to worry about.

14:48.570 --> 14:50.160
Both in personality and abilities.

14:51.120 --> 14:54.050
The only ones who can help him
at critical times...

14:54.830 --> 14:56.160
...are you and me.

15:07.970 --> 15:08.930
Hey...

15:09.410 --> 15:11.820
You do indulge yourself when I'm away.

15:11.820 --> 15:15.560
Alright, let's start
our first cleaning in four years.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.370
The three of us will do it together.

15:19.270 --> 15:21.980
This house has aged quite a bit.

15:21.980 --> 15:24.190
The grime won't come off easily.

15:24.190 --> 15:27.410
After all, we've lived here
since I was born.

15:28.070 --> 15:29.200
You're right.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.260
This is the scene I've longed for.

15:33.410 --> 15:34.080
But...

15:34.660 --> 15:36.180
My heart is filled with unease.

15:38.040 --> 15:40.670
While being a Hunter...

15:41.090 --> 15:44.630
...did I cross a line
that should never be crossed?

15:46.630 --> 15:47.440
Jinwoo.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.390
Huh? What is it?

15:51.720 --> 15:54.600
Has your father contacted you?

15:59.190 --> 16:01.480
By the way, I saw the news.

16:01.480 --> 16:03.530
That you became a Hunter.

16:03.530 --> 16:04.150
Mhm.

16:04.580 --> 16:08.510
Your father was a firefighter
before becoming a Hunter.

16:08.510 --> 16:12.740
I married him because I thought
he looked cool when saving lives.

16:12.740 --> 16:16.010
You've inherited his trait.

16:17.460 --> 16:21.290
I'm also trying to become a doctor
to heal people.

16:21.290 --> 16:22.670
Yes, that's right.

16:22.670 --> 16:24.380
Jinah, you've inherited it too.

16:24.380 --> 16:26.380
Right?

16:27.010 --> 16:27.920
Hello?

16:29.130 --> 16:30.010
Phew...

16:30.510 --> 16:32.390
You handled the press conference well.

16:32.970 --> 16:33.680
Yeah.

16:34.140 --> 16:36.140
Thank you for attending as well.

16:36.140 --> 16:37.000
It's nothing.

16:37.850 --> 16:41.150
I didn't expect him to visit
after the press conference.

16:41.980 --> 16:43.770
Thomas Andre.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.800
He's the America's S-Rank
national authority Hunter.

16:47.690 --> 16:50.530
I half-expected him to come help.

16:51.110 --> 16:53.740
Given the timing,
it was reasonable.

16:54.100 --> 16:59.080
But someone with power
tantamount to the national military

16:59.080 --> 17:02.250
usually wouldn't intervene
in a foreign country's operations.

17:02.250 --> 17:03.340
True.

17:04.250 --> 17:07.000
But then, why would he...

17:07.000 --> 17:11.930
Maybe as he claimed,
he was just passing through.

17:11.930 --> 17:15.600
He may have come to intimidate us
regarding Hunter Hwang

17:16.010 --> 17:19.720
or to verify something.

17:20.890 --> 17:23.770
Is Hunter Sung still unreachable?

17:23.770 --> 17:25.480
No, we just contacted him.

17:25.860 --> 17:27.360
He should arrive soon.

17:29.490 --> 17:31.570
We'll depart in four days.

17:32.030 --> 17:34.910
This raid mission has been
our long-cherished goal.

17:34.910 --> 17:37.120
Will you lend us your strength?

17:38.870 --> 17:41.410
It's a prime opportunity for leveling up.

17:41.410 --> 17:42.880
A pity to pass up.

17:43.750 --> 17:45.840
I would've thought so before.

17:50.880 --> 17:51.620
I...

17:53.800 --> 17:55.210
Magical power waves?!

17:56.760 --> 18:00.120
It's truly impressive that you can
sense it from this distance.

18:00.850 --> 18:05.390
The S-Rank Hunters are
warming up at the gymnasium.

18:05.860 --> 18:09.400
If you're interested,
you can go take a look.

18:23.120 --> 18:24.830
Instructor Baek!

18:24.830 --> 18:29.090
You're still young, so shouldn't you work on
strengthening your legs and back a bit more?

18:29.090 --> 18:32.840
I'm just an office worker now,
Instructor Ma!

18:34.350 --> 18:38.630
S-Rank Hunters rarely gather like this.

18:39.260 --> 18:43.890
The magical power wave earlier
must have been from them.

18:44.640 --> 18:46.770
Hunter Baek is being pushed back.

18:46.770 --> 18:51.480
If President Baek goes all out,
Hunter Ma probably couldn't withstand it.

18:52.110 --> 18:53.070
Hello.

18:53.650 --> 18:58.080
The person wearing the dobok
is Ma Dongwook from the Fame Guild.

18:58.930 --> 19:01.240
Why isn't he using full strength?

19:01.240 --> 19:04.620
The opponent doesn't seem like someone
he needs to hold back against.

19:04.620 --> 19:08.000
It's undesirable to show his true power
in front of so many people.

19:08.390 --> 19:12.710
When he fights at full power,
he becomes a real monster.

19:13.110 --> 19:15.840
So the rumors about
the transformation-type Hunter are true.

19:15.840 --> 19:20.220
Also, those people over there
are from the Knights Guild...

19:22.140 --> 19:23.220
Oh?

19:23.220 --> 19:25.100
They've come too.

19:26.560 --> 19:32.570
They're Japan's S-Rank Hunters
and Guild Master Goto Ryuji.

19:32.910 --> 19:35.280
Hmm? Who's that?

19:35.740 --> 19:36.700
Ah...

19:36.700 --> 19:40.570
That's Hunter Sung Jinwoo,
who recently became an S-Rank Hunter.

19:40.570 --> 19:42.490
Seems to be a highly capable Assassin.

19:42.960 --> 19:45.500
No. He's a Mage.

19:47.830 --> 19:48.830
A Mage?

19:50.710 --> 19:51.710
Oh?

19:51.710 --> 19:56.300
Isn't that Hunter Sung
who embarrassed our Minsung?

19:57.520 --> 19:59.790
No wonder the atmosphere here changed.

20:07.520 --> 20:09.730
So they are this country's top forces.

20:09.730 --> 20:10.900
Somewhat disappointing.

20:11.440 --> 20:14.610
Maybe because I'm always
watching Mr. Goto's battles,

20:14.610 --> 20:16.900
they don't look like
S-Rank to me at all.

20:16.900 --> 20:18.530
It's too early to judge.

20:18.530 --> 20:20.740
I can't let that comment slide.

20:21.150 --> 20:22.160
Miss Translator.

20:22.160 --> 20:24.450
You were mocking us just now, weren't you?

20:24.450 --> 20:26.500
I can tell even if it's in Japanese.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.080
Brilliant, Guild Master!

20:28.510 --> 20:29.460
You are...

20:29.460 --> 20:32.540
This is the Guild Master
of the Knights Guild,

20:32.540 --> 20:34.340
Mr. Park Jongsoo.

20:34.340 --> 20:35.630
Park Jongsoo?

20:35.630 --> 20:37.010
Never heard of him.

20:37.810 --> 20:41.010
The Master is an A-Rank Hunter,
not an S-Rank Hunter.

20:41.010 --> 20:43.100
That's probably why.

20:43.100 --> 20:46.140
But we're still one of
the top five guilds in the country.

20:46.140 --> 20:48.390
- During this raid mission...
- What are you doing?

20:48.390 --> 20:51.900
You'd better not cause trouble.

20:51.900 --> 20:55.270
They're the ones saying we're weak.

20:55.650 --> 20:57.490
Alright, calm down.

20:57.490 --> 20:58.690
Good timing.

20:59.010 --> 21:01.610
Since everyone's here,
let's hold a friendly match.

21:01.610 --> 21:03.400
Only S-Rank Hunters will participate.

21:04.280 --> 21:06.160
Are you excluding me?!

21:06.160 --> 21:09.470
You can decide the rules of the match.

21:10.050 --> 21:11.290
That sounds good.

21:12.280 --> 21:18.300
However, Mages are hard to judge in strength,
and non-combat Hunters should be excluded.

21:18.760 --> 21:19.840
No problem.

21:20.180 --> 21:23.430
Then only combat-type Hunters
can participate.

21:23.430 --> 21:26.430
Being grabbed at the wrists,
touched on the back,

21:26.430 --> 21:29.140
and falling to the floor
will be considered a loss.

21:29.140 --> 21:32.350
The match won't be one-on-one.

21:32.350 --> 21:34.310
We all go together.

21:35.230 --> 21:38.780
It'll be chaotic on the island anyway.

21:42.360 --> 21:43.530
I understand.

21:43.530 --> 21:44.700
Let's do that then.

21:47.160 --> 21:49.160
Our participants will be:

21:49.160 --> 21:53.290
Hunter Cha, Hunter Lim,
Hunter Ma, and Hunter Baek.

21:53.710 --> 21:58.250
Ours will be:
Tawata, Kumamoto, Hoshino, and Tanaka.

22:00.210 --> 22:03.930
Then, let the friendly match begin.

22:42.050 --> 22:44.720
SOLO LEVELING

22:44.720 --> 22:48.220
EPISODE 21: IT WAS ALL WORTH IT

23:37.690 --> 23:40.980
EPISODE 22: WE NEED A HERO
