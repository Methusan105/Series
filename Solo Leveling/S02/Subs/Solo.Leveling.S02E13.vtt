00:07.900 --> 00:09.560
Could you stop the camera?

00:09.560 --> 00:10.440
Excuse me?

00:10.440 --> 00:12.590
Do it right now, or I'll break it.

00:12.590 --> 00:14.150
U-Understood!

00:30.500 --> 00:34.280
Hunter Sung. What do you
intend to do to Byung-gu?

00:35.490 --> 00:38.170
I asked you a question!

00:38.170 --> 00:40.840
We're running out of time.
Please stop talking.

00:44.030 --> 00:44.930
Arise.

02:33.180 --> 02:37.240
The chairman has called for the
execution of plan 9. Are you ready?

02:37.240 --> 02:38.890
Are you insane?!

02:39.380 --> 02:43.330
You wanna send us back to the island
while that monster is still there?!

02:43.330 --> 02:46.240
You'd be singing a different tune
if you'd seen it yourself!

02:46.240 --> 02:48.790
Goto died... like it was nothing.

02:49.640 --> 02:51.370
The new variant is dead.

02:52.070 --> 02:54.230
One of their hunters took it down.

02:54.610 --> 02:57.380
It's... dead?

02:58.130 --> 03:00.310
Do you still insist on staying behind?

03:03.930 --> 03:06.700
A skill that lets you use
the powers of the dead?!

03:06.700 --> 03:09.560
It wasn't just summoning magic?

03:09.870 --> 03:11.110
Byung-gu...

03:14.050 --> 03:15.850
I heard a voice.

03:17.090 --> 03:21.170
It was Hunter Min, asking
me to use his power.

03:34.250 --> 03:37.040
I think I can tell what
he was like in life.

03:37.920 --> 03:41.480
To immediately go and heal Hunter
Cha without even being given the order...

03:42.220 --> 03:44.200
He must've been a
kind, caring person.

03:45.650 --> 03:48.910
I can see why he wouldn't
want this getting out on TV.

03:48.910 --> 03:52.960
The ability to grow stronger and stronger
as he engages in more difficult battles...

03:52.960 --> 03:55.340
What a monstrous ability.

03:55.340 --> 03:57.360
But with Min...

03:57.940 --> 03:59.460
Hunter Sung.

03:59.460 --> 04:03.220
If you intend to continue
battling as a hunter,

04:03.220 --> 04:05.840
I'm sure Byung-gu's power
will be of great use to you.

04:06.190 --> 04:09.300
But... He always hated fighting.

04:12.490 --> 04:17.330
I would rather he not have
to return to the battlefield.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.210
This takes me back
to the red gate incident.

04:20.660 --> 04:23.320
You grabbed my
shoulder then, too.

04:23.730 --> 04:28.650
But this time, instead of giving an
order, you're making an earnest plea.

04:29.580 --> 04:32.070
Don't worry. I was
thinking the same thing.

04:37.490 --> 04:39.000
Release extraction.

05:00.870 --> 05:03.790
Thank you so much.

05:05.230 --> 05:07.220
How are they alive?

05:07.560 --> 05:10.700
After a rendezvous with Hunter Sung,
he proceeded to defeat the new variant.

05:10.700 --> 05:12.240
I can see that, you fool!

05:12.540 --> 05:13.990
How is he on the island?!

05:13.990 --> 05:16.940
I thought he wasn't
participating in the raid!

05:16.940 --> 05:18.140
There's no way to tell.

05:18.140 --> 05:21.480
From the magic power readings, all we
can say is he appeared out of nowhere.

05:21.480 --> 05:27.000
This is a nightmare. And after we
lost seven of our ten S-Rank hunters!

05:27.560 --> 05:31.330
Chairman, should we
proceed with plan 9?

05:31.330 --> 05:36.990
Any further casualties will undercut
our ability to respond to domestic gates,

05:36.990 --> 05:40.620
to say nothing about the
global balance of power.

05:40.620 --> 05:41.750
What's your call?

05:42.870 --> 05:46.300
We're pulling out.
Withdraw immediately.

05:46.750 --> 05:48.030
Understood.

06:04.230 --> 06:06.740
Why have the ants started
coming at us so suddenly?!

06:07.350 --> 06:10.510
How should we know?! I
thought the queen was dead!

06:10.510 --> 06:11.630
That's probably why!

06:12.910 --> 06:15.830
With their leader gone,
they're running amok!

06:15.830 --> 06:18.160
We can't let them
reach the mainland!

06:18.710 --> 06:20.190
They ain't gettin' past us!

06:20.190 --> 06:22.500
Time to show these bugs
what the Knights Guild can do!

06:22.500 --> 06:23.940
You got it, Master!

06:26.670 --> 06:29.190
Hurry, everyone!

06:34.910 --> 06:36.700
Well, this is a real shitshow.

06:36.700 --> 06:40.210
It seems like the ants trying to
flee the island are spreading out

06:40.210 --> 06:41.700
and heading toward the mainland.

06:41.700 --> 06:44.080
We have to hurry before
they cut off our route back!

06:44.080 --> 06:47.480
We should take
off at once. Let's go.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.080
What about Hunter Sung?

06:49.080 --> 06:52.700
He's staying behind to take care
of the remaining ants and eggs.

06:52.700 --> 06:57.040
I hate to admit it, but in our
condition, we'd only slow him down.

06:57.660 --> 07:00.380
And though she's no
longer in mortal danger,

07:00.380 --> 07:03.750
it'd be better to have the medic team
examine Hunter Cha as soon as possible.

07:11.830 --> 07:16.320
Getting experience from smashing
unhatched eggs is a nice surprise.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.040
I almost feel bad for not
using this thing more often.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.460
The Demon Monarch's Sword
sure does live up to its name.

07:38.830 --> 07:41.720
That said... I'll leave
the rest to you guys.

07:56.660 --> 07:59.160
I've finally hit level 100.

08:04.440 --> 08:07.820
He's still emitting a ton
of aura, even after dying.

08:09.380 --> 08:10.320
Arise.

08:18.080 --> 08:21.860
What is this darkness?
I can't sense anything.

08:21.860 --> 08:23.840
Did something happen
during the extraction?

08:25.900 --> 08:27.160
I'm back.

08:53.360 --> 08:55.550
For a second there,
I thought it had failed.

09:01.950 --> 09:05.200
Well, on to the other ants...

09:05.200 --> 09:06.760
My king.

09:09.110 --> 09:10.820
Did you just talk?

09:10.820 --> 09:11.900
Yes.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.990
None of the other shadows
could talk... So why can he?

09:15.990 --> 09:20.320
My king, I ask that
you grant me a name.

09:21.150 --> 09:24.280
"General" rank?
Never seen that before.

09:24.640 --> 09:27.170
Is the new rank why he can talk?

09:27.520 --> 09:29.370
And I've gotta wonder...

09:30.150 --> 09:34.850
I was the one who killed you.
Are you still willing to obey me?

09:34.850 --> 09:38.700
I did not die.

09:38.700 --> 09:42.510
By your hand, I was reborn.

09:42.920 --> 09:46.730
I am filled with joy.

09:46.730 --> 09:50.540
I swear to serve
you for eternity.

09:51.180 --> 09:54.700
Please grant me a name.

09:57.250 --> 09:58.190
Beru.

10:00.180 --> 10:02.310
Your name is Beru.

10:02.640 --> 10:05.350
I am honored.

10:05.900 --> 10:07.860
Now, back to business.

10:08.530 --> 10:09.600
Arise.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.330
They got past
the hunters at sea!

10:16.330 --> 10:19.630
We're the last line of defense!
We cannot let them reach the cities!

10:19.630 --> 10:21.240
Oh, no, no, no!

10:21.240 --> 10:23.570
How the hell do we
fight these things?!

10:23.570 --> 10:24.850
Tanks, get in front!

10:24.850 --> 10:26.750
We hold the line,
or we die trying!

10:31.290 --> 10:32.630
That's a lot of ants.

10:33.210 --> 10:38.990
Four thousand without a leader. They
appear to be fleeing in all directions.

10:38.990 --> 10:40.860
There were still that many?!

10:41.430 --> 10:43.050
Can you thin out
the numbers for me?

10:43.050 --> 10:46.080
If that is your wish,
my king, then certainly.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.530
You need only say the word.

10:48.370 --> 10:49.440
Go.

10:58.750 --> 11:00.550
Good! Keep it up.

11:00.550 --> 11:04.420
These things are dangerous, so be
careful and take one down at a time!

11:04.420 --> 11:07.120
Work together, and make sureâ€”

11:05.970 --> 11:07.130
Mr. Song!

11:12.790 --> 11:14.770
Are you okay, Mr. Song?!

11:14.770 --> 11:16.550
What just happened?!

11:21.620 --> 11:23.140
What was that light?

11:23.140 --> 11:27.680
I don't know. But
I think it saved us.

11:28.910 --> 11:30.270
Jinwoo...

11:32.610 --> 11:34.690
There's just too damn many!

11:34.690 --> 11:36.310
Can't you do something?

11:36.310 --> 11:38.170
Not without wrecking
the helicopter, no!

11:42.730 --> 11:43.930
I hate this.

11:43.930 --> 11:46.160
There's not a lot
we can do in midair.

12:04.090 --> 12:07.490
In the end, he
saved us once again.

12:11.970 --> 12:13.950
They should be able
to make it back now.

12:16.170 --> 12:20.420
Afterward, the majority of the ants
that had dispersed from the island

12:20.420 --> 12:25.040
were held off by the
many hunters in the field,

12:25.360 --> 12:29.090
minimizing the
damage to the mainland.

12:29.410 --> 12:32.300
Our country's S-Rank
hunters returned safely.

12:32.300 --> 12:37.950
Hunter Cha, who remained
unconscious, was transported to a hospital.

12:38.620 --> 12:42.600
It was a battle with
many casualties,

12:42.600 --> 12:48.360
but the emergent threat from the
island was successfully dealt with.

12:49.210 --> 12:54.640
And so, the fourth Jeju
Island raid ended in our victory.

12:58.290 --> 13:02.750
Looks like we've got more
visitors from far abroad.

13:02.750 --> 13:05.200
It's been two days of this now.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.160
They'll be within
firing range shortly.

13:07.160 --> 13:09.410
Notify the mage-type
hunters on standby.

13:09.410 --> 13:10.560
Prepare to intercept.

13:10.560 --> 13:11.470
No, belay that order.

13:11.910 --> 13:15.380
Our country's hero seems
to want a bit of exercise.

13:16.540 --> 13:17.970
Here they come.

13:18.680 --> 13:21.480
Can't just sit around
all day, after all.

13:22.030 --> 13:24.800
Let's send every last one
of them to a watery grave.

13:41.440 --> 13:45.080
If I'd gotten a crack at the
black ant instead of these peons,

13:45.080 --> 13:47.790
I might've actually
had some fun.

13:47.790 --> 13:49.630
What a shame.

13:50.260 --> 13:52.340
It's now been several
days since the raid ended.

13:52.870 --> 13:55.800
A memorial has been
erected to honor the victims,

13:56.220 --> 13:58.720
and a large crowd has
come to pay their respects.

14:00.590 --> 14:05.350
Here we have the S-Rank hunter,
Sung Jinwoo, approaching the table.

14:05.350 --> 14:09.030
He contributed a
great deal to this raid,

14:09.030 --> 14:12.510
with some saying that it would not have
been a success without his participation.

14:12.900 --> 14:15.280
Some are calling him a hero...

14:13.810 --> 14:17.230
But at the same time, many
are questioning whether or not

14:17.230 --> 14:20.700
there would have been fewer casualties
had he participated from the start,

14:20.700 --> 14:22.700
to sum up some of
the more critical voices.

14:28.430 --> 14:30.350
Please hold your head high.

14:30.700 --> 14:36.730
No matter what the public thinks, you're
the one who put an end to this tragedy.

14:51.350 --> 14:55.760
As chairman of the Hunter's
Association, I'd like to first thank you

14:56.340 --> 14:59.700
for your service during
the fourth Jeju Island raid.

15:00.170 --> 15:06.290
No... If I had got there sooner,
maybe Hunter Min could have survived.

15:06.790 --> 15:13.700
But thanks to you, the other five S-Ranks and
many of our countrymen's lives were saved.

15:13.700 --> 15:15.630
That is a major accomplishment.

15:16.060 --> 15:21.170
I promise that you will be rewarded
however you wish in due time.

15:21.780 --> 15:22.850
I understand.

15:24.560 --> 15:28.960
Now, I was wondering what
your plans are for the future.

15:28.960 --> 15:30.930
The future, sir?

15:30.930 --> 15:32.080
Right.

15:32.080 --> 15:37.450
This raid resulted in your power being
demonstrated on an international level.

15:37.450 --> 15:40.240
I doubt the public
will leave you alone.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.920
There will be many who will
try to approach you, as well.

15:42.920 --> 15:46.460
The Association
can't ignore that.

15:47.080 --> 15:51.250
Which is why I feel the need
to ask you, Hunter Sung...

15:51.250 --> 15:56.910
What do you intend to do with
your great power, and where?

16:02.450 --> 16:05.370
I'm thinking about
starting my own guild.

16:08.070 --> 16:10.750
How the hell didya end
up stuck on cleanup duty

16:10.750 --> 16:13.230
instead of attendin' the
memorial service, Master?!

16:13.230 --> 16:16.700
Hey, dumbass. Makin' sure the
enemies're dead, killin' stragglers,

16:16.700 --> 16:19.560
and collectin' resources
is all important stuff.

16:19.560 --> 16:23.650
Bein' entrusted with the last
bits of a job is a sign they trust me.

16:23.650 --> 16:24.410
But...

16:24.410 --> 16:25.950
And besides...

16:29.250 --> 16:34.540
A real man does the job he's given,
nice and steady, without no bitchin'.

16:34.540 --> 16:36.460
You're so awesome, Master!

16:38.720 --> 16:42.350
Who the hell're you?!
This place is off-limits!

16:42.350 --> 16:43.950
What are you doingâ€”

16:46.520 --> 16:48.250
What was that?!

16:48.250 --> 16:51.290
I dunno who you are,
but yer not supposedâ€”

16:55.220 --> 16:57.100
What did you do?

16:57.100 --> 16:59.430
All the noise they were
making was bothering me.

16:59.430 --> 17:01.200
I just had them
take a little nap.

17:01.670 --> 17:04.210
So, were you able to make sure?

17:04.210 --> 17:06.660
Yeah. It was
definitely his power.

17:06.660 --> 17:11.200
So very strange. Someone
like that, helping humans...

17:11.200 --> 17:13.920
He's always been an odd one.

17:14.370 --> 17:16.150
If you're that curious,
go and see him.

17:16.150 --> 17:18.050
If the opportunity
presents itself.

17:18.050 --> 17:20.800
I think we're done here.

17:22.550 --> 17:24.510
Let's head back.

17:24.830 --> 17:27.240
Isn't one of them here?

17:27.240 --> 17:30.170
We can leave this area to him.

17:30.170 --> 17:32.860
In other words, you
don't want to get involved.

17:33.420 --> 17:37.600
The hunt will commence as
planned. That hasn't changed.

17:45.530 --> 17:49.490
I guess it's not worth
the extra trouble.

17:50.960 --> 17:55.870
Quite the stench, though. I can only imagine
the fuss she'd make if she were here.

18:07.210 --> 18:09.140
I'm not getting anywhere.

18:09.830 --> 18:12.850
So, about the guild...

18:12.850 --> 18:15.960
Oh, Chairman Go
just gave his approval.

18:15.960 --> 18:19.320
Seriously?! Then I'll get
right on finding us an office!

18:19.320 --> 18:20.250
Hey!

18:20.250 --> 18:21.390
Waitâ€”

18:21.390 --> 18:24.420
Jinwoo! Make sure
you hire me, okay?!

18:24.420 --> 18:25.930
I promise I'll be useful!

18:25.930 --> 18:27.900
Come on, we're discussing
some very importantâ€”

18:27.900 --> 18:28.970
I'm hanging up.

18:27.900 --> 18:30.010
Like what, exactly?

18:30.430 --> 18:31.480
Those two...

18:32.640 --> 18:35.400
Man, I am seriously
not getting anywhere.

18:38.750 --> 18:39.930
Hello?

18:39.930 --> 18:42.240
Hunter Sung. This is Go.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.550
Did something
happen with the guild?

18:44.550 --> 18:46.450
No, I'm calling
about something else.

18:47.380 --> 18:49.430
Further down this highway?

18:49.430 --> 18:52.410
Correct. A B-Rank
gate has appeared.

18:52.410 --> 18:53.870
That explains it.

18:53.870 --> 18:56.100
Hunters are being arranged for,

18:56.100 --> 18:58.800
but it's going to take some
time before they can get there.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.840
Well, if you don't mind...

19:01.580 --> 19:03.980
One vehicle at a time, please!

19:03.980 --> 19:05.890
How much longer before
the hunters get here?

19:06.250 --> 19:09.030
You mean the traffic's so
bad the hunters can't make it?!

19:09.030 --> 19:10.630
What are we supposed to do?

19:10.630 --> 19:12.440
Hey, don't hang up!

19:14.000 --> 19:15.560
I'm here to close the gate.

19:15.560 --> 19:16.360
Oh, right!

19:16.360 --> 19:18.100
Manager Woo informed me.

19:18.100 --> 19:22.800
But it's going to be a while before
the other hunters are able to make itâ€”

19:21.260 --> 19:22.800
I'll be fine solo.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.090
But...

19:26.050 --> 19:27.920
There he goes.

19:27.920 --> 19:30.490
I mean, I know it's only
a B-Rank gate, but...

19:33.960 --> 19:35.180
Don't tell me...

19:36.370 --> 19:40.280
Well, this is
obviously a red gate.

19:41.530 --> 19:44.020
How does this keep
happening to me?

19:44.020 --> 19:47.810
The exit's closed, and I have no
idea how far this forest extends...

19:48.950 --> 19:52.940
Now I'm thinking I should've
told Mom I was gonna be late.

19:56.020 --> 19:59.690
Then again, if this is all that's in
here, it shouldn't take that long.

20:23.580 --> 20:25.650
Let's make this quick.

20:33.340 --> 20:35.080
He came to the
memorial ceremony.

20:35.870 --> 20:41.290
This raid proved that I
still have a lot to learn.

20:41.290 --> 20:45.000
I wasn't able to do
anything. I had to be saved.

20:45.870 --> 20:48.510
But not him.

20:49.760 --> 20:52.050
I want to catch up to him.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.480
I want to stand at his side.

20:55.050 --> 20:56.010
And to do that...

20:58.360 --> 21:00.440
I need to get stronger.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.790
Hunters are born to hunt.

21:08.240 --> 21:10.930
Dungeons are worlds where
survival is all that matters,

21:10.930 --> 21:13.600
and a hunter has to be prepared
to become prey at any time.

21:14.590 --> 21:18.660
That's because there's no telling
when the roles might be reversed.

21:19.250 --> 21:21.780
You're always one
step away from death.

21:22.390 --> 21:25.180
But hunters are
still willing to fight,

21:25.670 --> 21:27.610
no matter how many
enemies they face,

21:27.610 --> 21:30.950
or how much stronger
those enemies might be.

21:31.880 --> 21:35.050
They've all got different
reasons for fighting.

21:35.050 --> 21:37.010
To protect their family.

21:37.010 --> 21:38.970
To uphold their ideals.

21:39.740 --> 21:41.890
To prove who they are.

21:42.420 --> 21:44.350
To defy fate.

21:45.640 --> 21:48.940
So hunters continue to hunt.

21:50.130 --> 21:53.740
And none of them are ready to stop.

22:14.530 --> 22:17.100
On to the next target.
