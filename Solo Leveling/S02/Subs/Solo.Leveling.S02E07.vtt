00:11.900 --> 00:15.160
Whoa, look over there! That's Baek
Yoonho from the White Tiger Guild!

00:15.160 --> 00:17.720
Choi Jong-in from the Hunters Guild, too!

00:18.500 --> 00:20.570
Look at all the press.

00:20.570 --> 00:22.830
What are they even here for?

00:22.830 --> 00:26.150
Are the two of you here
to recruit Lee Minsung?

00:26.150 --> 00:28.080
Minsung? Who are they talking about?

00:26.150 --> 00:28.770
What's the likelihood that
he'll be retiring from acting?

00:28.770 --> 00:31.500
I'm not here for him.

00:28.770 --> 00:31.500
Do you have any comment on his assessment?

00:31.500 --> 00:35.870
I understand that Mr. Minsung has
contracted with the Reaper Guild already,

00:35.870 --> 00:37.720
so this is a separate matter.

00:37.720 --> 00:39.010
Damn...

00:39.010 --> 00:40.880
It would've spiced the story up.

00:40.880 --> 00:43.110
What a waste of time.

00:43.110 --> 00:44.760
I've heard the news.

00:44.760 --> 00:48.700
That A-Rank gate that nearly hit the
S-Rank threshold was real trouble, huh?

00:48.700 --> 00:54.770
Nothing as serious as the red gate that
cost the White Tigers a rookie A-Rank.

00:54.770 --> 00:58.390
I heard you were on the verge
of giving us a call, though.

00:58.390 --> 01:01.600
He's the reason why that wasn't necessary.

01:01.600 --> 01:06.670
The Hunters Guild is prepared to give him
a very warm welcome as a show of gratitude.

01:06.670 --> 01:11.910
Don't be ridiculous! He saved our people,
too! And after a casualty, at that!

01:14.810 --> 01:19.390
Do you really need more S-Ranks?
Are you looking to start a war?

01:19.390 --> 01:23.090
I could say the same thing to you!

01:24.980 --> 01:28.020
Hey, if it isn't Jong-in and Yoonho.

01:28.020 --> 01:32.790
You boys aren't here to try and
snatch Minsung from us, are you?

01:32.790 --> 01:36.400
Like I said, I don't give a damn
about Minsung or Min-<i>anyone</i>!

01:32.790 --> 01:36.400
I already said, I don't care
about Minsung or Min-<i>anyone</i>!

01:36.820 --> 01:39.810
Damn, you guys are in sync.

01:40.410 --> 01:42.660
Uh, I'm here for my reassessment.

01:43.140 --> 01:44.470
What's going on?

03:15.840 --> 03:18.250
Check it out! It's
Minsung's press conference!

03:18.550 --> 03:19.870
The actor?

03:19.870 --> 03:22.410
He's supposed to be a total playboy.

03:22.410 --> 03:24.420
They call him the co-star killer.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.420
What are they talking about?

03:24.420 --> 03:26.220
Is he giving a public apology?

03:24.420 --> 03:26.220
Don't care.

03:26.660 --> 03:29.800
I'd like to thank you
all for gathering today.

03:30.130 --> 03:35.570
As you're all aware, I, Lee Minsung,
have awakened as a hunter.

03:35.570 --> 03:38.020
I'll be getting my rank assessed today.

03:38.350 --> 03:41.580
Since the day I awakened,
I've struggled with this decision.

03:41.580 --> 03:43.500
But now I've made up my mind!

03:43.500 --> 03:45.950
To fulfill the destiny
that I've been born with!

03:46.570 --> 03:52.330
I'll be fighting for Mr. Lim Tae-gyu,
the guild master of the Reaper Guild!

03:52.330 --> 03:55.460
Are your acting days over?

03:55.460 --> 03:57.390
Isn't this jumping the gun
before your assessment?

03:57.390 --> 03:59.230
Will you be focusing on your hunter duties?

03:59.960 --> 04:04.630
How gullible can they get?
I've got my A-Rank already.

04:04.630 --> 04:08.090
My contract with the
Reapers is for two years.

04:08.090 --> 04:11.150
I'll dabble in hunting for that time,

04:11.150 --> 04:12.900
people will forget all about my scandals,

04:12.900 --> 04:17.680
and after? I'll be an
A-Rank hunter who acts.

04:17.680 --> 04:21.920
No matter what rank I receive, I'm prepared
to fight as a hunter with my life on the—

04:21.920 --> 04:23.530
What do you think you're doing?!

04:23.530 --> 04:25.420
Can't you see all these reporters?

04:25.420 --> 04:27.190
You're in the way! Buzz off!

04:27.190 --> 04:29.660
Uh, I have business with the Association.

04:29.660 --> 04:30.900
It can wait!

04:30.900 --> 04:33.280
Who is this oblivious idiot?

04:33.620 --> 04:36.450
This entrance is closed!
Now get out of here—

04:36.450 --> 04:39.560
I'm afraid that isn't your call to make.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.160
Ch-Chairman Go!

04:42.620 --> 04:45.460
This young man is a guest of mine.

04:46.090 --> 04:50.520
I seem to recall asking you to refrain from
holding a press conference at this hour.

04:50.520 --> 04:54.310
But... I'm trying to distract from my...

04:51.470 --> 04:54.310
Right this way, Hunter Sung.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.770
What the hell do I do now?

05:00.290 --> 05:03.730
I'll be right back! I just need to
confirm with the Association!

05:06.320 --> 05:09.840
There's someone else being
reassessed at the moment.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.370
I'm afraid you can't enter
until it's complete.

05:13.380 --> 05:16.150
Dude, do you know who I am?

05:16.150 --> 05:18.310
One word from me,
and you'll be out on your—

05:18.310 --> 05:21.120
I can't say I recognize you,

05:21.120 --> 05:26.210
but I don't appreciate
your lack of consideration.

05:30.910 --> 05:35.050
After hearing about today,
they came to await your results.

05:35.560 --> 05:40.790
I'm sure they're interested in the first
S-Rank hunter to appear in two years.

05:45.770 --> 05:47.510
Before we begin the reassessment,

05:47.510 --> 05:50.830
I'd like to confirm the nature
of your hunter abilities.

05:50.830 --> 05:53.700
What kind of powers do
you have, Hunter Sung?

05:53.700 --> 05:55.870
I can produce these.

05:59.200 --> 06:02.180
I... assume this is a summon?

06:02.180 --> 06:05.000
Then you have summoning magic.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.440
That... sounds right, sure.

06:07.440 --> 06:09.210
Hunter Sung.

06:09.210 --> 06:12.390
I've received a detailed account of
your abilities from Manager Woo.

06:12.390 --> 06:15.180
You're not going to
hold out on us, are you?

06:15.430 --> 06:18.760
Yeah, I guess the cat's out
of the bag at this point.

06:24.940 --> 06:27.940
I can produce around a hundred more.

06:27.940 --> 06:29.830
A h-hundred?!

06:29.830 --> 06:31.490
That's unbelievable!

06:33.190 --> 06:35.280
His magic power is tremendous!

06:35.280 --> 06:37.490
It's enough to overwhelm even me...

06:38.500 --> 06:42.360
This is Hunter Sung's power?!

06:45.400 --> 06:49.420
Thank you for your patience.
Your reassessment is now complete.

06:49.420 --> 06:52.190
This is your new hunter ID.

06:52.590 --> 06:56.670
Perfect. Now I can sell the Sphere of
Avarice without raising any eyebrows.

06:56.670 --> 07:01.420
That should cover the gear I need
to beat the Demon's Castle!

07:01.420 --> 07:06.270
You are now officially an S-Rank hunter.

07:06.660 --> 07:11.770
I'm looking forward to seeing
what you do with that strength.

07:16.410 --> 07:19.240
Congratulations on your S-Rank assessment.

07:19.240 --> 07:23.440
Would you mind letting me thank you
for your help the other day?

07:23.440 --> 07:26.030
I've got something I'd like
to discuss with you, as well.

07:26.030 --> 07:28.550
If you could spare some of your time...

07:28.550 --> 07:31.110
Sorry. I've actually got something
to attend to right now.

07:31.110 --> 07:32.300
Hang on, there's still—

07:32.650 --> 07:34.170
Huh? What did he...

07:38.220 --> 07:40.200
Uh, hey...

07:40.650 --> 07:42.390
Hmm?

07:42.390 --> 07:45.300
Hey. Hey, pay attention!

07:45.300 --> 07:46.590
What?

07:46.590 --> 07:49.900
That's Jinwoo—uh, your
brother on the stream.

07:49.900 --> 07:51.130
Huh?

07:54.650 --> 07:56.910
No way! How?!

07:57.360 --> 08:01.630
We've only just been able
to confirm this information.

07:58.360 --> 08:00.550
He really did make the news.

08:00.550 --> 08:05.370
I tried to tell you!
He's got a killer's eyes!

08:01.630 --> 08:05.370
It's been one hour since
Chairman Go appeared,

08:05.370 --> 08:07.830
No telling what kind of
messed-up stuff he's done!

08:05.370 --> 08:07.830
accompanying him to his reassessment...

08:07.830 --> 08:11.750
and now Hunter Sung has been
officially named as S-Rank.

08:11.750 --> 08:14.140
The Association's
database has been updated,

08:14.140 --> 08:18.500
and while there has been no announcement,
it seems his S-Rank status is confirmed.

08:18.500 --> 08:19.890
He is now

08:19.890 --> 08:22.050
the 10th S-Rank hunter in the country—

08:22.050 --> 08:26.020
the first to emerge in the
two years since Hunter Cha.

08:29.100 --> 08:30.060
An S-Rank?!

08:30.060 --> 08:31.430
W-Wait—

08:30.060 --> 08:31.440
He's the tenth S-Rank!

08:31.440 --> 08:32.890
Hurry! Get after him!

08:31.440 --> 08:33.790
But... my press conference...

08:33.790 --> 08:34.900
Don't let him get away!

08:36.440 --> 08:39.930
I wasn't able to get Mr. Sung
to accept the offer.

08:39.930 --> 08:40.950
I see.

08:43.130 --> 08:44.160
Sorry.

08:44.610 --> 08:48.170
There's still something I need
to take care of on my own.

08:48.940 --> 08:53.410
And to do that, I need to keep fighting
and get even stronger.

08:54.060 --> 08:57.720
Joining up with any organization
would only get in the way.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.300
Jinho.

09:02.280 --> 09:03.790
That's why...

09:06.550 --> 09:10.810
He... also asked me to join him.

09:12.080 --> 09:16.190
And you realize how selfish that would be?

09:17.900 --> 09:21.660
I had every intention of letting
Jinsung run this operation.

09:22.020 --> 09:27.070
You then came in,
and despite everything you said,

09:27.070 --> 09:29.100
instead of actually accomplishing anything,

09:29.100 --> 09:31.790
you intend on forsaking your
responsibilities to work elsewhere?

09:32.820 --> 09:34.540
You can't be serious.

09:42.260 --> 09:44.000
Dad, I'm sorry.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.360
But I'm still going to work with Mr. Sung.

09:53.770 --> 09:57.900
Then you had best be prepared
for the consequences.

10:00.770 --> 10:02.220
Back away, please!

10:02.660 --> 10:04.860
Please keep a reasonable distance!

10:05.260 --> 10:07.450
Don't push! It's dangerous!

10:06.190 --> 10:08.370
Don't wear yourself out dealing with them.

10:08.370 --> 10:11.290
We'll give you a lift home.

10:11.290 --> 10:12.330
It's okay.

10:19.090 --> 10:24.000
He's so physically gifted,
despite being a mage-type hunter...

10:24.550 --> 10:25.820
President Baek?

10:26.750 --> 10:29.430
So fast! Faster than I could see!

10:30.020 --> 10:32.730
He's gotten even stronger since then.

10:33.260 --> 10:34.890
How is that possible?!

10:36.800 --> 10:38.630
It's time to gear up.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.680
We've been waiting for you, Hunter Sung.

10:44.150 --> 10:47.850
You're looking for artifacts capable
of defending against flame, yes?

10:47.850 --> 10:50.580
May I inquire the specifics?

10:50.580 --> 10:53.510
I'm looking for protection
from a dungeon that's pretty hot.

10:53.510 --> 10:56.530
I see! In that case...

10:56.530 --> 10:59.020
These may be what you're looking for.

10:59.020 --> 11:03.710
A cape that you can wear on top of your
clothes, and a ring that's easy to equip.

11:03.710 --> 11:05.100
Perfect!

11:05.850 --> 11:08.220
And at these prices,
they should be well within your budget.

11:09.710 --> 11:12.180
I don't suppose... I can get a discount?

11:14.070 --> 11:19.550
I'm ever so sorry, sir, but the listed
prices are the only ones we offer.

11:19.550 --> 11:26.360
That said, if you can shatter this glass,
then you can have them free of charge.

11:27.160 --> 11:32.260
We happen to use glass
that is magically enhanced, you see.

11:32.260 --> 11:36.430
This glass? I can sense magic power,
but not that much...

11:32.260 --> 11:36.870
Constructed as to not even budge
under blows from an A-Rank hunter.

11:36.870 --> 11:42.340
Across all the globe, you won't find
a display case of comparable security!

11:42.340 --> 11:46.130
Wait, please! It was
only a joke, I'm afraid.

11:46.130 --> 11:50.620
Any unusual vibrations will summon security,
even if the glass isn't fully broken.

11:50.620 --> 11:53.290
Oh! I didn't realize. Sorry.

11:53.290 --> 11:56.430
No, I should be the one to apologize.
It was in most poor taste.

11:56.880 --> 12:01.920
Well.. uh... I was looking for some
other stuff, too. Like daggers.

12:01.920 --> 12:05.570
I'm in charge of weapons,
so please allow me.

12:05.570 --> 12:07.070
Right this way.

12:11.370 --> 12:14.320
But he hadn't even touched it...

12:15.230 --> 12:16.930
How much for this one?

12:16.930 --> 12:20.540
For that item, if you'll look here...

12:20.540 --> 12:22.550
This little thing?

12:22.550 --> 12:25.100
It's only about as strong
as Kasaka's Venom Fang.

12:26.870 --> 12:28.270
In that case...

12:28.810 --> 12:30.090
Sir?

12:30.090 --> 12:32.050
Where'd I put it...?

12:32.410 --> 12:34.650
How much could I get for this?

12:34.650 --> 12:36.560
Oh, this is impressive.

12:36.930 --> 12:40.120
I can sense an attention to detail
from the craftsman.

12:40.120 --> 12:43.230
It was just an item on sale in the store...

12:43.230 --> 12:46.520
I believe it would sell for
no less than a hundred million.

12:46.520 --> 12:47.630
A hundred mill—?!

12:48.010 --> 12:50.870
But it only cost 2.8 million gold.

12:52.160 --> 12:55.120
If the store's items can be
sold at these prices...

12:55.370 --> 12:58.470
I might not even need to sell
the Sphere of Avarice.

12:59.710 --> 13:01.770
Could I use your bathroom?

13:01.770 --> 13:03.150
Oh, sure.

13:06.180 --> 13:09.010
I knew he was strong.

13:09.010 --> 13:11.970
But what I saw... goes far beyond that.

13:12.680 --> 13:15.280
The magic power I could sense
from the assessment lab,

13:15.280 --> 13:17.310
and the athleticism he showed...

13:17.970 --> 13:20.510
His reawakening should be long since past.

13:20.510 --> 13:25.020
And yet he's even stronger since then.
Is that even possible?

13:26.780 --> 13:29.680
What if he's not a reawakened hunter...

13:29.680 --> 13:33.850
but one capable of
getting stronger over time?

13:41.220 --> 13:46.480
They're finally gone. Now I can head
to school without worrying...

13:46.480 --> 13:47.500
You mean the press?

13:47.990 --> 13:49.760
The Association must've chased them off.

13:49.760 --> 13:52.810
Uh, if you were gonna be on TV,
could you at least tell me,

13:52.810 --> 13:55.040
instead of making a huge scene
out of nowhere?!

13:54.110 --> 13:56.100
Whoa, it wasn't <i>my</i> idea.

13:56.830 --> 13:58.180
Oh, by the way...

13:58.180 --> 14:00.980
I'm gonna be out of the house
for about a week, starting tomorrow.

14:00.980 --> 14:03.550
Again? What now?

14:05.520 --> 14:07.070
Could you people give it a—

14:08.030 --> 14:11.820
Yoo Jinho, your trusty
sidekick, has arrived!

14:11.820 --> 14:14.120
Huh. Is this a friend of yours?

14:14.120 --> 14:16.230
You must be his sister!

14:16.230 --> 14:19.310
I'm your brother's trusted
assistant, Yoo Jinho!

14:21.710 --> 14:25.140
Starting tomorrow, we're gonna
be on a job for a week.

14:25.140 --> 14:27.430
Tomorrow? What are you—

14:27.430 --> 14:28.710
We're gonna be on a job.

14:29.070 --> 14:30.210
Aren't we?

14:30.790 --> 14:34.640
Y-Yep! Tomorrow's job is a big deal!
Painfully so...

14:43.560 --> 14:46.980
They might be gone for now,
but given all the media coverage...

14:47.440 --> 14:48.520
Come out.

14:50.950 --> 14:54.260
Huh? I thought Tusk had four bodyguards.

14:54.260 --> 14:55.570
Where's the other one?

14:58.080 --> 15:02.000
Right, I didn't get to extract his shadow
because he was smashed into the ceiling.

15:02.720 --> 15:06.230
Well, whatever. Strong as you are,
three of you should be plenty.

15:07.340 --> 15:10.690
You're in charge.
I need you to protect Jinah.

15:13.330 --> 15:14.690
Look after my sister for me.

15:16.630 --> 15:19.350
I should take a few more
precautions while I'm at it.

15:22.560 --> 15:24.250
Start your patrol.

15:27.020 --> 15:30.800
Might end up making the city
a little safer, come to think of it.

15:37.680 --> 15:40.980
Thanks for letting me stay the night.

15:41.620 --> 15:45.050
I don't mind, but what are you
gonna do going forward?

15:45.050 --> 15:47.240
He didn't say you had to move out.

15:47.240 --> 15:49.840
It's my way of owning
up to the consequences.

15:49.840 --> 15:53.300
What's this job at the DS Tower, though?

15:53.580 --> 15:56.830
You mentioned yesterday that you
wouldn't be coming home for a week.

15:56.830 --> 15:59.390
Well... Let's call it training.

15:59.390 --> 16:03.540
You wanna get even <i>stronger</i>?!
After earning an S-Rank?

16:04.010 --> 16:05.070
I guess I do.

16:09.390 --> 16:11.770
Thanks. I'm heading out.

16:11.770 --> 16:13.860
Sure! Come back safe.

16:14.230 --> 16:17.780
A ring enchanted with water,
and a cape with wind...

16:18.180 --> 16:19.990
That'll help me beat the heat.

16:20.710 --> 16:24.030
It's time I finished off
the Demon's Castle.

16:25.440 --> 16:26.960
Quest info?

16:27.690 --> 16:30.860
"Collect Demon Souls 2."

16:30.860 --> 16:34.500
I need to defeat the Demon Monarch,
Baran, and collect his soul.

16:34.500 --> 16:37.350
Rewards... A rune stone
for Shadow Exchange.

16:37.350 --> 16:39.430
That sounds like a job-exclusive skill!

16:39.430 --> 16:43.260
That's a better reward than last time.
A nice bit of extra motivation.

16:43.930 --> 16:47.980
Let's head to the 75th
floor, where I left off.

16:51.980 --> 16:55.150
I never would've thought Jinho
would take off on his own.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.230
Do you miss him?

16:57.230 --> 17:00.740
A troublesome child has
left the nest, that's all.

17:00.740 --> 17:03.200
Honestly, I'm surprised he
stuck around as long as—

17:03.830 --> 17:05.750
That's strange...

17:05.750 --> 17:06.830
Honey?

17:07.280 --> 17:08.800
It's all dark...

17:08.800 --> 17:10.250
Honey?!

17:10.740 --> 17:12.230
Honey!

17:29.360 --> 17:31.260
Time for a test drive.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.230
Come on out, Tusk.

18:23.660 --> 18:27.240
He blew it away?!
And that's after being nerfed?

18:27.670 --> 18:30.720
Might have to think carefully
about how to use that move.

18:31.230 --> 18:34.640
For now, I'll have Tusk hold on
to the Sphere of Avarice.

18:35.780 --> 18:38.460
I see. Jinho came to visit, then?

18:38.820 --> 18:42.790
Yes... I told him it was exhaustion.

18:43.900 --> 18:45.260
I'm sorry about this.

18:46.060 --> 18:48.220
Then it's... Eternal Sleep Disease?

18:48.670 --> 18:54.650
Yes. After periods of sudden drowsiness,
it leads to a persistent coma.

18:55.120 --> 18:57.940
How did I end up with such a disease?

18:58.400 --> 19:03.040
It tends to occur in people with
naturally low resistance to magic power

19:03.040 --> 19:05.330
after prolonged exposure to it.

19:05.330 --> 19:09.500
Do you have any hunters
in your personal life?

19:11.110 --> 19:12.430
Honey...

19:14.700 --> 19:16.640
My son's a hunter.

19:17.320 --> 19:21.050
We can't be certain
that is the cause, but...

19:22.510 --> 19:26.220
The entire world is permeated
with magic power these days.

19:26.220 --> 19:28.850
And I have no resistance.

19:31.930 --> 19:35.900
Am I being... culled?

19:36.860 --> 19:39.710
Sure is peaceful, huh?

19:39.710 --> 19:41.290
Sure is.

19:41.290 --> 19:43.110
You wanna go fishing after?

19:43.110 --> 19:46.300
Aw, come on. We're still on patrol, y'know.

19:48.770 --> 19:50.200
What... is that?

19:54.500 --> 19:57.430
I formed six squads of shadows
for efficiency's sake.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.910
Looks like having them
split up has paid off.

20:00.700 --> 20:04.420
When I sent them out,
I gave them two orders:

20:05.050 --> 20:08.390
Each team is to take down
any enemies they encounter,

20:08.920 --> 20:11.600
and if they find an entry permit,
they're to let me know.

20:12.520 --> 20:14.830
That means missing out on any other items,

20:14.830 --> 20:17.290
but we're making much
faster progress in exchange.

20:17.900 --> 20:19.990
Or so I thought.

20:19.990 --> 20:22.360
But it's been two days since
we made it to the 80th floor,

20:22.360 --> 20:24.280
and the pace has slowed down a lot.

20:25.110 --> 20:26.760
Is there some reason?

20:28.630 --> 20:31.120
The shadows are being destroyed.

20:31.700 --> 20:33.950
That's the high orc squad A.

20:34.430 --> 20:37.790
I didn't think any of the greater demons
would be a match for the high orcs.

20:38.780 --> 20:42.630
I'll recall them and go check it out.

20:46.220 --> 20:49.160
Squad B's down now, too.

20:49.550 --> 20:52.550
I don't know who did this,
but they must be pretty fierce.

20:53.420 --> 20:58.380
Something doesn't make sense, though.
Tusk's squad was right by squad A.

20:58.380 --> 21:01.900
So why was squad B, which was
further away, the next to go down?

21:01.900 --> 21:04.570
Did they know they weren't
strong enough to beat Tusk?

21:05.130 --> 21:10.590
If they target foes based on strength,
that implies a level of intelligence.

21:10.590 --> 21:14.480
And if that's the case,
the next target is likely...

21:29.300 --> 21:30.760
Makes sense.

21:32.800 --> 21:36.180
No wonder the magic beast soldiers
couldn't handle them.

21:52.700 --> 21:54.820
I've been curious for a while now.

21:56.720 --> 21:59.500
Do magic beasts feel fear?

22:02.460 --> 22:05.770
Guess I have my answer.
