rabbits come out of hats...

in astrology and homeopathy...

-Yes.

14:26.907 --> 14:29.284
Channel-set baguettes,
20 points total weight.

14:29.493 --> 14:33.121
Remarkable. Diamonds.
Crystallized carbon.

14:33.289 --> 14:36.624
Every day, people go to the grocery
store and come home with sacks...

14:36.792 --> 14:39.419
...full of carbon in the form
of charcoal briquettes...

14:39.587 --> 14:42.171
...they toss in their barbecues
and set on fire.

14:42.339 --> 14:46.050
But just because you've got some
carbon with the atoms stacked neatly...

14:46.218 --> 14:48.887
...you expect me to plunk down
thousands of dollars.

14:49.096 --> 14:51.806
Actually, that's only 750.
Everything's on sale.

14:52.016 --> 14:54.142
Really? Talk to me
about that pocket watch.

14:58.522 --> 15:01.024
I'm still trying to wrap
my mind around it.

15:01.191 --> 15:04.652
I always thought
I'd be a dad someday.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.322
Me too. You're so caring.

15:07.489 --> 15:10.533
I've often pictured you guiding
a young boy into manhood.

15:15.539 --> 15:19.667
There you go, Howard. Sounds like Raj'll
have your babies. Problem solved.

15:19.877 --> 15:22.045
Because a man
shows caring for another man...

15:22.212 --> 15:25.882
...doesn't mean he's displaying the love
that dare not speak its name.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.094
Did she say she didn't want kids?

15:30.304 --> 15:32.347
Yeah. She doesn't like them.

15:32.514 --> 15:35.224
And from what I saw,
the feeling was mutual.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.191
-What are you gonna do?
-I don't know.

15:43.359 --> 15:47.570
I can't see a life where I don't have kids.
I mean, people have kids.

15:47.780 --> 15:52.408
I mean, even Donkey Kong
had Donkey Kong Jr.

15:53.827 --> 15:57.205
So he could teach someone
how to kidnap princesses...

15:57.373 --> 16:00.333
...and throw barrels
at Italian plumbers.

16:02.503 --> 16:06.172
You know, there's no guarantee even if
you have kids you're gonna like them.

16:06.382 --> 16:09.008
Wow, that's rough.
Where'd you get that?

16:10.886 --> 16:13.429
It's right off the dust jacket
of my mom's last book.

16:17.476 --> 16:20.103
Maybe me and Bernadette
aren't right for each other.

16:21.730 --> 16:24.440
Look, Howard, I'd say
there's a lot of fish in the sea...

16:24.608 --> 16:27.276
...but I watched you dangle your hook
for years.

16:27.444 --> 16:29.529
Do not throw her back.

16:32.950 --> 16:36.536
I don't want to,
but this is kind of a deal breaker.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.746
What will your mom say
if you call off the wedding?

16:38.914 --> 16:42.000
Heh, it'll kill her.
If I don't give her grandchildren...

16:42.167 --> 16:46.045
...that'll kill her too. So either way
on the Mom front, I'm golden.

16:49.717 --> 16:53.094
-What time did you tell Amy to be here?
-Eight o'clock.

16:58.809 --> 17:01.561
-That pocket watch is ridiculous.
-Nonsense.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.855
I look like a train conductor.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.569
Under what pretext
did you lure her here?

17:10.571 --> 17:12.822
I said, ''Hey, wanna come
over and hang out?''

17:12.990 --> 17:16.617
Good, good. If you'd said something clever,
she might've gotten suspicious.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.287
-Hey.
-Hi.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.915
-What's he doing here?
-Okay, he wants to talk to you.

17:23.083 --> 17:26.794
Well, I don't wanna talk to him.
And I'm pretty disappointed in you too.

17:26.962 --> 17:29.547
Although we both know
that won't last.

17:31.967 --> 17:33.926
-Sheldon, you're up.
-Thank you.

17:34.136 --> 17:37.013
Amy, I'd like to apologize.

17:37.222 --> 17:41.309
Your accomplishment was impressive,
and I'm proud of you.

17:45.773 --> 17:48.149
-We both know that's your koala face.
-I told you.

17:49.943 --> 17:51.903
Okay, look. He bought you this.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.782
Jewelry? Seriously?

17:55.991 --> 17:59.577
Sheldon, you are the most shallow,
self-centered person I have ever met.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.121
You think another
transparently manipulative--

18:02.289 --> 18:03.873
Oh, it's a tiara!

18:04.041 --> 18:08.002
A tiara. I have a tiara. Put it on me,
put it on me, put it on me...

18:08.212 --> 18:10.296
...put it on me, put it on me,
put it on me.

18:13.842 --> 18:15.510
You look beautiful.

18:15.719 --> 18:18.304
Of course I do.
I'm a princess and this is my tiara.

18:28.398 --> 18:30.817
You were right.
The tiara was too much.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.533
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard, Bernadette's--

18:38.700 --> 18:41.077
Oh. She slipped right by me.

18:42.788 --> 18:45.248
-Here's your vest back.
-You should keep it.

18:45.415 --> 18:48.209
-You could wear it again sometime.
-Where?

18:48.961 --> 18:50.545
I don't know, hunting?

18:52.005 --> 18:55.174
Don't forget to talk to her
about this meshugas...

18:55.342 --> 18:57.093
...where I don't get grandkids.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.973
[YELLING]: Don't worry, Ma, I will,
as soon as I can figure out...

19:02.141 --> 19:04.517
...a way to bring up
such a sensitive issue.

19:09.481 --> 19:12.066
-Guess you talked to your mom.
[IN NORMAL VOICE]: I was upset.

19:12.234 --> 19:15.027
My mom can be
a pretty good shoulder to cry on...

19:15.195 --> 19:18.114
...if the smell of Bengay
doesn't burn your eyes.

19:19.741 --> 19:23.119
Look, it's obvious having kids
is really important to you...

19:23.287 --> 19:25.329
...and I think I came up
with a solution.

19:25.539 --> 19:28.916
Really? That's great. What?

19:29.084 --> 19:32.336
Well, seeing as how I make
way more money than you anyway...

19:32.546 --> 19:35.339
...what if I work
and you stay home with the kids?

19:36.466 --> 19:37.550
-Me?
-Yeah.

19:37.759 --> 19:41.304
You know, you'll watch Barney
and pull Cheerios out of their noses...

19:41.513 --> 19:44.682
...and go on play dates and I'll work
and have conversations...

19:44.850 --> 19:47.351
...with people my own age
and enjoy my life.

19:51.732 --> 19:55.276
-Yeah.
-Yay! So we're good.

19:55.485 --> 19:57.778
Yeah, we're good.

20:00.157 --> 20:02.241
I don't know if this counted as a fight...

20:02.409 --> 20:04.702
...but how about some make-up sex?

20:04.912 --> 20:09.081
I would love that.
But what is that behind your ear?

20:09.249 --> 20:10.917
Oh, look, it's a condom.

20:41.448 --> 20:43.449
