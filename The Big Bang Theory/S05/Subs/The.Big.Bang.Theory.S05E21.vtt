00:03.753 --> 00:06.755
So I got the craziest e-mail
this morning.

00:06.923 --> 00:11.719
I don't mean to burst your bubble,
but penile-enlargement pills do not work.

00:13.096 --> 00:15.055
Believe me, I know.

00:16.266 --> 00:19.143
The e-mail I got was from the office
of Stephen Hawking.

00:19.310 --> 00:20.728
-You're kidding.
-Why?

00:20.895 --> 00:22.938
He's coming to the university
to lecture...

00:23.106 --> 00:27.192
...and he's looking for an engineer to
maintain equipment on his wheelchair.

00:27.360 --> 00:30.738
That's amazing.
You'll be like his pit crew.

00:32.782 --> 00:36.076
A word of caution, I would not do
your Stephen Hawking impression...

00:36.244 --> 00:37.995
...in front of him.

00:38.788 --> 00:40.247
[MIMICS STEPHEN HAWKING]
You're right.

00:40.415 --> 00:41.623
[BOTH CHUCKLING]

00:42.417 --> 00:46.170
[MIMICS STEPHEN HAWKING] I suppose
that could be considered offensive.

00:46.921 --> 00:49.339
Oh, boy.
Oh, Sheldon's going to freak out.

00:49.507 --> 00:51.258
Yeah, he worships Hawking.

00:51.426 --> 00:55.387
I was thinking about bringing him along,
so he can meet the great man.

00:55.555 --> 00:58.223
-That's really nice of you, Howard.
-It's no big deal.

00:58.391 --> 01:01.643
Boy, a restraining order
from Stephen Hawking.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.563
It'll look so nice
next to the ones he's got...

01:04.731 --> 01:07.274
...from Leonard Nimoy,
Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.

01:08.610 --> 01:11.820
Leonard, do you recall when I said
that I was going...

01:11.988 --> 01:15.074
...to revolutionize understanding
of the Higgs boson particle...

01:15.241 --> 01:18.786
...and you said, ''Sheldon, it's 2 a.m.
Get out of my bedroom''?

01:19.746 --> 01:21.663
Like it was 1 0 hours ago.
What about it?

01:21.831 --> 01:23.415
Well, I believe I've done it.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.709
I'm only saying ''believe''
to sound modest...

01:25.877 --> 01:28.128
...because, sweet Sam Houston,
I did it.

01:28.296 --> 01:30.297
-Really?
-That's incredible. Oh, here.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.841
-Break out the math.
-Oh, okay. Let me see this.

01:33.009 --> 01:37.679
All right, so this particle here
is the boson moving forward in time.

01:37.847 --> 01:39.598
Now, I was thinking--

01:39.766 --> 01:43.227
Howard, you go ahead and eat.
This isn't gonna make any sense to you.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.689
Sheldon, I have a working understanding
of physics.

01:47.857 --> 01:50.484
Yeah, good for you.
And don't stop working on it.

01:52.028 --> 01:53.487
You still going to tell him...

01:53.655 --> 01:55.572
-...about you-know-who?
-Yep.

01:55.740 --> 01:58.242
-Still gonna introduce him?
-Not on your life.

02:25.186 --> 02:29.189
Please, please, please.
Let me meet Hawking.

02:29.357 --> 02:32.317
-I told you no.
-But I said I'm sorry.

02:32.485 --> 02:35.237
No, you said,
''Would it help if I said 'I'm sorry'?''

02:36.447 --> 02:38.157
Well, and you never answered me.

02:38.324 --> 02:40.492
So who owes whom an apology now?

02:41.327 --> 02:43.287
Sheldon, you're a condescending jerk.

02:43.454 --> 02:46.707
Why on earth would I want
to do something nice for you?

02:46.875 --> 02:48.917
To go to Jewish heaven?

02:50.837 --> 02:52.379
Jews don't have heaven.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.381
Well, then, to avoid Jewish hell?

02:54.549 --> 02:56.758
Have you met my mother?
I live in Jewish hell.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.971
Howard, please.
This is Stephen Hawking.

03:01.139 --> 03:04.183
Perhaps my only intellectual equal.

03:04.684 --> 03:06.476
You can't be serious.

03:06.644 --> 03:08.187
Try to put yourself in my place.

03:08.354 --> 03:11.106
Imagine you're the sole human being...

03:11.274 --> 03:13.984
...living on a planet
populated with nothing but dogs.

03:14.152 --> 03:18.655
And then it turns out
there's another human being.

03:21.451 --> 03:25.204
Hang on.
Are you saying the rest of us are dogs?

03:25.371 --> 03:27.789
I can see you're gonna
take this the wrong way.

03:27.957 --> 03:29.208
Let me try again.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.460
Imagine
you're the sole human being...

03:31.628 --> 03:35.047
...living on a planet
populated with nothing but chimps.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.298
Get out of my lab.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.675
Oh, now,
they're so much smarter than dogs.

03:38.843 --> 03:41.303
Have you seen them
on those little bicycles?

03:41.471 --> 03:43.597
Get out!

03:44.724 --> 03:46.642
-How about dolphins?
-Out!

03:48.937 --> 03:51.355
So come on,
how was the first day with Hawking?

03:51.522 --> 03:53.899
It was great. We talked about movies.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.484
Oh.

03:56.319 --> 03:59.071
-I showed him some card tricks.
-Oh.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.490
He even let me read a couple pages
from his new book.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.617
Oh....

04:05.161 --> 04:07.913
Something got you down there,
bunky?

04:08.081 --> 04:11.083
Howard, please, I'm begging you.

04:11.251 --> 04:14.503
Raj, you're our group historian.
Has Sheldon ever begged before?

04:14.671 --> 04:15.879
Three times.

04:16.047 --> 04:19.341
He begged the Fox network
not to cancel Firefly.

04:19.926 --> 04:23.887
He begged the TNT network
to cancel Babylon 5.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.350
And when he got food poisoning
at the Rose Bowl parade...

04:28.518 --> 04:32.187
...he begged a deity he doesn't believe in
to end his life quickly.

04:33.481 --> 04:36.400
Do you understand
how important Hawking is to me?

04:36.567 --> 04:41.238
When I was 6 years old,
I dressed up as him for Halloween.

04:43.032 --> 04:44.825
-You're kidding.
-No, sir.

04:44.993 --> 04:48.453
No, I took my dad's desk chair,
attached a Speak & Spell to it...

04:48.621 --> 04:52.040
...and made my sister push me up
and down the block to trick-or-treat.

04:53.960 --> 04:58.338
Granted, most people thought I was
R2-D2, but still, I got a lot of candy.

04:58.506 --> 05:01.925
You don't seem to be understanding
the English word ''no.'

05:02.093 --> 05:04.052
Maybe a different language will help.

05:04.220 --> 05:11.059
Russian: Nyet. Chinese: bù.
Japanese: iie. Klingon: qo'.

05:18.818 --> 05:22.321
-It's actually 01 1 01 1 1 1 0--
-No!

05:22.613 --> 05:24.906
I'm not asking for me.

05:25.074 --> 05:27.576
I'm asking for Hawking.

05:28.703 --> 05:32.122
Let me try gangster: Hells no.

05:35.793 --> 05:37.377
Okay, look. How about this?

05:37.545 --> 05:40.130
You just give him my paper
on the Higgs boson.

05:40.298 --> 05:43.258
If he sees the breakthrough I've made,
he'll reach out to me.

05:43.426 --> 05:46.053
-What if he doesn't?
-Yeah, he will. He's really smart.

05:48.681 --> 05:50.515
That's an interesting idea.

05:50.683 --> 05:53.727
Why don't you give me a minute
to talk it over with my friends?

05:53.895 --> 05:55.020
-How?
-Walk away.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.813
Walking away!

06:05.573 --> 06:08.658
You do realize
you own his ass right now.

06:08.826 --> 06:10.786
I do.

06:10.953 --> 06:12.829
You can make him
do anything you want.

06:12.997 --> 06:16.625
Yeah, I know. I'm just trying to figure out
how much I wanna punish him.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.001
Well, don't be too mean.

06:18.169 --> 06:19.961
Hey, I'm thinking about making...

06:20.129 --> 06:22.631
...freshly brewed iced tea
if anyone would like some.

06:22.799 --> 06:25.759
-I wouldn't mind a glass.
-I wasn't talking to you.

06:28.096 --> 06:31.181
Bring him to his bony knees.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.310
Sheldon, come on back.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.479
Yes, yes!

06:41.984 --> 06:43.068
What did you decide?

06:44.112 --> 06:45.946
I'll give your paper to Hawking.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.240
Great. Thank you. Oh, that's terrific.

06:48.408 --> 06:53.537
But in exchange,
I'd like you to do a few things for me.

06:53.704 --> 06:55.330
What kinds of things?

06:55.498 --> 07:00.085
Are you familiar
with the 12 labors of Hercules?

07:01.879 --> 07:03.380
Of course.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.799
You should be so lucky.

07:08.678 --> 07:12.013
All right.
What would you like me to do first?

07:12.181 --> 07:17.144
Well, I thought I'd start you off
by polishing my belt buckles.

07:17.311 --> 07:21.648
By all means. Yeah, when I was a boy,
I would polish my Mee-Maw's silver.

07:21.816 --> 07:25.402
And she would entertain me with stories
about growing up in Oklahoma.

07:25.570 --> 07:26.653
Interesting woman.

07:26.821 --> 07:30.991
You know, she once killed a prairie dog
with a gravy boat.

07:31.659 --> 07:33.827
That's nice.

07:40.543 --> 07:42.043
Whew. Heh.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.131
That's a lot of belt buckles.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.676
Funny thing is I only have one belt.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.096
Anyway, I'll let you get started.

07:53.264 --> 07:57.350
Oh, by the way, the little marks
that look like water spots...

07:57.518 --> 08:00.145
...I tend to stand too close
to the urinal, so....

08:02.523 --> 08:06.026
What you're seeing there
is splash-back.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.696
You make sissy on your belt buckles?

08:12.658 --> 08:15.785
Mee-Maw's forks never had that.

08:15.953 --> 08:19.831
Here is a black light to check them.
For your own peace of mind...

08:19.999 --> 08:23.084
...you might not wanna shine that
around the rest of the room.

08:32.762 --> 08:35.096
Sheldon, these look great.

08:35.264 --> 08:37.974
I mean,
they're like magnificent little crowns...

08:38.142 --> 08:40.852
...to hang
over my magnificent little jewels.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.481
How did you get them so shiny?

08:44.649 --> 08:47.067
Oh, I buffed them with Turtle Wax.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.319
The man down at Pep Boys
says from now on...

08:49.487 --> 08:52.405
...the urine should just bead up
and roll right off.

08:53.199 --> 08:56.117
Way to go the extra mile.
Your Mee-Maw would be proud.

08:56.285 --> 08:58.828
My Mee-Maw
must never know of this.

08:59.455 --> 09:01.623
Now will you give
Professor Hawking my paper?

09:01.791 --> 09:04.000
Oh, my dear boy, no. Okay.

Next, this is a sexy French maid
costume I bought for Bernadette.

09:11.175 --> 09:12.968

09:13.135 --> 09:15.887
...and get her to dust my room
at the same time, heh...

09:16.055 --> 09:18.848
...but I was wrong and really wrong.

-Hello.

It's not Saturday night.
Why are you doing your laundry?

10:01.309 --> 10:04.644
This is not my laundry.

Kind of trashy. Good for her.

Why are you washing
Howard's man-panties?

he won't give my paper to Stephen Hawking.

-He's a famous physicist--
-Yeah.

I know. He's the wheelchair dude
who invented time.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.715
Close enough.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.760
Why doesn't Howard
just introduce you to the guy?

10:36.927 --> 10:40.930
Because he's punishing me
for being a, quote, ''condescending jerk.''

You don't think I'm condescending,
do you?

10:44.226 --> 10:46.519
-Well....
-Oh, I'm sorry.

10:46.687 --> 10:48.938
-Condescending means--
-I know what it means!

10:49.899 --> 10:52.734
And, yes, you love correcting people
and putting them down.

says ''who'' instead of ''whom''...

that Howard is being mean to me for no reason.

to wear the French maid's costume.

You've heard him tease me
about not having a doctorate.

You don't wanna get teased about that,
get a doctorate.

I'm letting him have a little taste
of his own medicine.

12:29.540 --> 12:33.626
It's not the same. Sheldon doesn't know
he's being mean. The part of his brain...

12:33.794 --> 12:37.130
...that should know is getting a wedgie
from the rest of his brain.

a couple more things, then I'll stop.

We're gonna have to work as a team.

I'm not sure how to do this.

14:02.424 --> 14:07.595
MRS. WOLOWITZ: It's easy. Just pretend
you're putting away a sleeping bag.

14:08.722 --> 14:13.059
SHELDON: Sleeping bags don't usually
sweat this much, but okay.

Now zip me up.

you might turn into a diamond.

Oh, guys, I just remembered.

I got you some Hawking souvenirs.

on the motor drive...

15:06.113 --> 15:08.281
...and when I was putting it
back together...

15:08.449 --> 15:11.492
...I could not for the life of me
figure out where they went.

15:15.122 --> 15:16.205
I did it.

15:16.373 --> 15:18.416
Had to go to three clothing stores...

15:18.584 --> 15:23.046
...but we finally found a dress
that could envelop your mother.

15:24.465 --> 15:27.675

my paper to Professor Hawking?

-I don't know.
-Oh, for heaven's sake.

15:39.855 --> 15:43.024
I did your laundry.
I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles.

15:43.192 --> 15:47.570
I even sprained my wrist
helping your mother lift her bosom.

15:52.493 --> 15:56.037
All right, Sheldon. There's only
one thing left I want you to do.

-Don't worry, it's an easy one.
-Okay.

Fine.

You have very tiny hands.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.718
No. About my job.

I want you to tell me
I'm good at what I do.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.016
You're obviously good
at what you do.

16:17.184 --> 16:20.103
Well, then, why are you always ripping
on me?

16:20.270 --> 16:21.771
Oh, I understand the confusion.

16:21.981 --> 16:25.400
No. I have never said
that you are not good at what you do.

16:25.901 --> 16:29.696
It's just that what you do
is not worth doing.

16:35.119 --> 16:38.538
It's nicer than anything
he's ever said to me. I'd take it and run.

-Sorry, I can't.
-What? Why not?

16:46.547 --> 16:48.589
I gave it to him three days ago.

Please let Professor Hawking know...

at his earliest convenience.
