- Sure.

- Okay, Priya.
- I'll have the Shepherd's Pie.

00:08.331 --> 00:11.357
- You want to split that with me?
- Oh, no, no, no, he doesn't.

[LAUGHING]

00:22.712 --> 00:25.738
Not quite accurate.
The Macy's balloons are filled with helium...

...whereas Leonard produces
copious amounts of methane.

frozen yogurt. Do not believe it.

I have amazing news.

01:05.188 --> 01:07.179
Bernadette,
before you change the subject...

01:07.357 --> 01:11.157
...does anyone have any final comments
on Leonard's faulty digestive system?

01:11.728 --> 01:13.252
So, what's your news, Bernadette?

01:14.464 --> 01:17.262
The thesis committee accepted
my doctoral dissertation.

01:17.433 --> 01:19.196
I'm getting my PhD.

01:19.369 --> 01:20.961
- Oh, congratulations.
- Oh!

- Ha-ha-ha!
- Yeah, ha, ha!

01:34.784 --> 01:37.150
- Congratulations, honey.
- Thank you.

01:37.320 --> 01:40.778
So, Howard, tell us, how's it feel
knowing that when you two get married...

01:40.957 --> 01:43.949
...you'll be referred to
as Mr. And Dr. Wolowitz?

01:45.328 --> 01:47.159
Unless he takes Bernadette's last name.

01:47.330 --> 01:50.128
And considering her status,
that could open doors for him.

01:50.300 --> 01:52.200
Please, this isn't about me.

01:52.368 --> 01:55.565
- I'm proud of you.
- Well, you'll really be proud of this.

Better than what you've got
a buttload of.

If I roll down the windows in the car,
everything's peachy.

on the car window deal.

It's indeed admirable.

05:00.423 --> 05:03.392
Although, it is microbiology.

05:04.427 --> 05:08.625
Your doctorate is in neurobiology.
I fail to see the distinction.

I'll make it simple for you.

I study the brain, the organ responsible
for Beethoven's "Fifth Symphony."

to support such a valuable payload.

I'd like to respond to that sarcastically.

Hint: Sometimes they pack the alcohol
in their trunks.
