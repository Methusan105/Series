WEBVTT

00:09.259 --> 00:10.926
I've never seen him
this happy before.

00:11.094 --> 00:14.596
It's because you've never seen him on
"Restock the Medicine Cabinet Day."

00:14.764 --> 00:15.931
Look!

00:16.099 --> 00:18.684
A new topical
antihistamine with lidocaine.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.728
Wow!

00:20.895 --> 00:22.438
I can't wait until I get a rash.

00:24.149 --> 00:26.859
Oh, Gas-X has a new ultra strength.

00:27.485 --> 00:29.528
I guess they really do
read their mail.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.574
Hey, isn't that Professor Proton?

00:33.742 --> 00:35.075
Oh, yeah.

00:39.664 --> 00:41.999
Look at him, just standing in line,

00:42.125 --> 00:45.252
like he wasn't moderately
famous 30 years ago.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.087
Let's go say hello.

00:47.255 --> 00:49.423
Oh, maybe we shouldn't bother him.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.711
I'm not going to bother him,
I'm going to talk to him.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.304
He thinks there's a difference.

00:55.472 --> 00:57.264
Arthur?

00:57.432 --> 00:59.683
Arthur, it's me, Sheldon Cooper.

00:59.851 --> 01:03.145
You may not remember
because of your advanced age.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.815
Trust me, I... I remember.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.193
This is my girlfriend, Amy.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.320
Amy, this is television
legend Arthur Jeffries.

01:11.488 --> 01:15.365
His science show
inspired millions of children.

01:15.533 --> 01:18.118
Hold... Hold on.

01:18.286 --> 01:20.746
You... You have a girlfriend?

01:21.706 --> 01:23.832
Yes, and I've heard
so much about you.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.668
Hey, look, we're wearing
the same orthopedic shoes.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.547
I can't believe I dress
like a celebrity.

01:33.134 --> 01:35.344
Okay, I get it now.

01:37.013 --> 01:39.264
Dr. Jeffries, hello again.
Leonard Hofstadter.

01:39.432 --> 01:42.518
Oh, oh, right,
I remember your girlfriend.

01:44.562 --> 01:47.689
Is she... is she here?

01:47.857 --> 01:49.358
No, she's not.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.287
So, what prescription
are you getting filled?

01:52.445 --> 01:53.885
- Sheldon.
- No. Wait, I want to guess.

01:53.905 --> 01:54.905
Don't tell me.

01:55.073 --> 01:57.449
I wasn't going to tell you.

01:58.576 --> 01:59.660
Sheldon, come on.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.829
No, no, no. I'm really good at this.
All right, give me a hint.

02:01.996 --> 02:05.999
Does it involve difficulty initiating
a stream of anything?

02:07.877 --> 02:11.588
Well, given my age,
that's more than just a lucky guess.

02:12.715 --> 02:14.424
Hey, Sheldon,
let's go mock the people

02:14.592 --> 02:17.344
buying homeopathic medicine.
You love that.

02:17.512 --> 02:19.753
But I'm hanging out with my friend,
and we're having fun.

02:19.889 --> 02:21.682
Look how happy he is.

02:51.546 --> 02:54.214
Bernie's having a girls' night
on Friday at our place.

02:54.382 --> 02:55.424
You want to do something?

02:56.509 --> 02:58.343
- Actually, I'm busy.
- Doing what?

02:58.511 --> 03:00.888
There's a new sports bar
over on Colorado Ave.

03:01.055 --> 03:03.432
- You're going to girls' night.
- Yeah.

03:05.268 --> 03:06.894
You know
they're making jewelry, right?

03:07.437 --> 03:09.146
You think they came up with that?

03:10.273 --> 03:12.774
They were going
to drink beer and play darts.

03:13.902 --> 03:17.321
- What's up?
- Not his testosterone levels.

03:17.488 --> 03:20.449
Excuse me. I happen to be very
comfortable with my masculinity.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.702
How is that possible?

03:27.665 --> 03:30.459
Hey, I got an email
from Professor Proton.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.377
Goody! What's it say?

03:32.545 --> 03:35.297
He's working on a paper
about nano vacuum tubes,

03:35.465 --> 03:37.257
and wants to know
if I'd take a look at it.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.593
That's strange,

03:39.761 --> 03:42.054
that he would come to you
for that and not me.

03:43.806 --> 03:45.349
Oh, I got two emails from him.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.686
"Do you have Leonard's
email address?"

03:52.273 --> 03:53.273
And...

03:53.441 --> 03:55.692
"Never mind, I found it."

03:57.820 --> 03:59.738
I can't believe
he picked you over me.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.491
You don't want to read a paper
by some old has-been

04:02.659 --> 04:05.994
who hasn't done
any real science in decades.

04:06.162 --> 04:07.621
Yeah, it's nothing to cry about.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.249
Sheldon Cooper does not cry.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.292
It's true. You'd rust.

04:18.174 --> 04:20.342
And to think I idolized that man.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.010
And why?

04:22.178 --> 04:24.930
At the end of the day he's just
another Hollywood phony.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.433
Is it really worth
getting upset about?

04:28.601 --> 04:30.185
They say don't meet your heroes.

04:30.353 --> 04:33.146
Don't peek behind
that curtain of fame and celebrity,

04:33.314 --> 04:36.191
because if you do,
you'll see them as they really are:

04:36.359 --> 04:38.235
degenerate carnival folk.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.281
Come on,
he's a retired kids show host.

04:42.448 --> 04:45.659
That's even worse.
Using the sweet candy of science

04:45.827 --> 04:47.744
to trick children into loving him.

04:49.247 --> 04:50.455
Pervert.

04:53.209 --> 04:56.837
Have you thought about why Arthur
didn't want you to read his paper?

04:57.005 --> 04:58.380
Yes, I have.

04:58.548 --> 05:01.174
And my only conclusion is the
prescription he was picking up

05:01.342 --> 05:03.302
the other day was for cuckoo pills.

05:04.637 --> 05:07.848
Maybe he found you a bit much.

05:09.225 --> 05:11.268
That's kind of a stretch.

05:11.436 --> 05:14.438
Look, when it comes to social skills,
I've mastered the big three.

05:14.605 --> 05:17.107
There's the coy smile.

05:18.609 --> 05:20.610
There's the friendly chuckle.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.782
There's the vocalization of sympathy.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.492
Aww...

05:28.369 --> 05:30.912
That last one's tricky.
I'm still working on it.

05:31.956 --> 05:33.790
From what I saw the other day,

05:33.958 --> 05:37.169
I could understand why he and...

05:37.337 --> 05:39.713
some people might find you...

05:41.341 --> 05:42.341
What?

05:44.969 --> 05:46.720
Doesn't matter.

05:46.888 --> 05:49.139
No, go ahead, say it.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.892
I know what it is.
I've heard it my whole life.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.227
The word's "annoying".
Go ahead, say it.

05:54.395 --> 05:56.605
Say it. Say I'm annoying.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.857
- Sheldon...
- Oh, it won't hurt my feelings.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.734
Go ahead, Amy, say I'm annoying.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.611
I'm annoying. I'm annoying.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.280
I'm annoying.
Yeah, now where are you going?

06:05.448 --> 06:07.657
Look, you know you want
to say it. Say it.

06:08.242 --> 06:10.619
Say I'm annoying. Go ahead, say it.

06:10.953 --> 06:13.830
Say it. Say it. Amy, say it.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.960
Well, she can't stand it
when I'm right.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.255
This is fun.

06:22.423 --> 06:24.174
I'm going to feel like such
a vixen wearing jewelry

06:24.342 --> 06:27.511
that doesn't have a list
of medications I'm allergic to.

06:28.262 --> 06:29.583
Penny, how's it going over there?

06:29.639 --> 06:32.849
Good. I'm just having
little trouble with the glue.

06:34.143 --> 06:37.813
How do you not know how to use glue?
Did you ditch pre-school?

06:38.815 --> 06:41.191
Yeah, but only because
I was dating a second grader.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.153
Hello, everyone.

06:45.321 --> 06:47.948
Okay, let me have it.

06:48.116 --> 06:51.159
Let's hear all
the "Raj is a girl" jokes.

06:51.327 --> 06:54.121
Nope, Bernadette told me
it isn't nice and I'm not allowed.

06:54.288 --> 06:56.415
- Thank you.
- So I won't be making fun of you,

06:56.582 --> 06:59.918
or the things you like, or the fact
that you just want to have fu-un.

07:04.090 --> 07:07.050
Howie, stop.
Come on, look at what I'm making.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.511
Oh, that's actually pretty nice.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.389
- I'm making a bracelet.
- Yeah, I'm just making a mess.

07:14.934 --> 07:17.352
You know, instead of beads and glue,

07:17.520 --> 07:18.920
you guys can use my soldering iron.

07:19.021 --> 07:20.856
You'd be able to make
much cooler stuff.

07:21.023 --> 07:24.192
Oh, I think we're doing
just fine, thank you.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.736
Actually, I'd kind of like
to try that.

07:26.904 --> 07:28.280
- Me, too.
- Be right back.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.867
When did I have pistachios?

07:37.665 --> 07:41.877
Arthur.

07:43.754 --> 07:45.547
Door knocker.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.466
That's TV money.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.053
Sheldon, what are you doing here?

07:52.221 --> 07:54.806
I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

07:54.974 --> 07:57.267
Of course you woke me.
It's 7:30.

07:59.937 --> 08:02.814
Well, I would have been here sooner,
but for some reason your home

08:02.982 --> 08:05.734
isn't on this map of Hollywood stars.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.278
What do you want, Sheldon?

08:09.405 --> 08:11.364
It's been pointed out
by my girlfriend

08:11.532 --> 08:14.367
that I may have been annoying to you.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.453
She sounds like a keeper.

08:17.747 --> 08:21.833
Anyway, I wanted to apologize.
I am truly sorry.

08:21.959 --> 08:23.919
All right, apology accepted.
Have a nice night.

08:24.086 --> 08:26.755
Now that we've cleared the air,

08:26.923 --> 08:29.216
I wanted to discuss
another matter with you.

08:29.383 --> 08:32.135
Sheldon, in a couple hours,
I have to get up,

08:32.303 --> 08:34.763
pee and then wander
around the house.

08:41.646 --> 08:43.939
Well, then, I'll make this quick.

08:44.106 --> 08:46.733
I want to talk about the paper
you sent Leonard.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.262
Now, I know he said it's promising

08:48.486 --> 08:50.195
and he's going to collaborate on it,

08:50.404 --> 08:54.282
but now that you and I are friends
again, I am at your disposal.

08:54.450 --> 08:56.117
And, frankly, lending my name

08:56.285 --> 08:58.912
and reputation to it will help,
because a lot of people think

08:59.080 --> 09:01.790
that you're a washed-up has-been.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.959
Or dead.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.628
I should be so lucky.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.798
So, what do you say?

09:10.800 --> 09:12.361
You know,
if it's all the same with you,

09:12.468 --> 09:13.969
I think I'll stick with Leonard.

09:14.720 --> 09:18.139
It's because I'm annoying, right?
I know it is. Say it.

09:18.307 --> 09:19.641
Say it. Say I'm annoying.

09:19.809 --> 09:20.976
- Good night.
- Say it.

09:21.143 --> 09:25.105
Arthur, say it.
Say I'm annoying. Say it. Say it.

09:25.273 --> 09:27.107
I'm annoying. Say it.

09:28.150 --> 09:29.526
You're annoying!

09:32.989 --> 09:34.155
Wow, that really hurt.

09:40.329 --> 09:41.997
If you would have told me
when I was a kid

09:42.164 --> 09:43.873
that someday
I would be doing science

09:44.000 --> 09:47.002
next to Professor Proton,
I would not have believed you.

09:47.169 --> 09:50.589
If someone had told me that people
would still call me Professor Proton

09:50.756 --> 09:53.174
when I was 83 years old,

09:53.342 --> 09:55.176
I never would have quit smoking.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.682
I'm sorry, Dr. Jeffries,
I'm just excited.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.893
This nano vacuum tube idea
of yours, it's really interesting.

10:04.061 --> 10:06.646
Hello, Leonard. Oh, hello, Arthur.

10:06.814 --> 10:09.190
What an odd coincidence
that you're both here.

10:09.358 --> 10:10.650
Why is it odd?

10:10.818 --> 10:13.695
Because as it just so happens,
I'm also spending the day

10:13.863 --> 10:16.781
with a beloved children's
television science personality.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.242
Isn't that right,
new friend and colleague,

10:19.410 --> 10:20.744
Bill Nye the Science Guy.

10:25.833 --> 10:28.710
Sorry, I replaced you
with a newer model.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.421
Wow, Arthur Jeffries.

10:31.589 --> 10:32.714
It's an honor to meet you.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.050
My show never would
have happened without yours.

10:35.217 --> 10:37.052
That's what I told my lawyers.

10:40.139 --> 10:43.892
Mr. Nye, hello. I'm sorry he got
you involved in this nonsense.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.269
He said I'd be speaking to a class.

10:46.437 --> 10:49.689
No, I said you were teaching
someone a lesson. Now let's go.

10:51.692 --> 10:53.068
What are you guys working on?

10:53.235 --> 10:56.237
Oh, we're making nano vacuum tubes.

10:56.947 --> 10:59.574
- That's interesting.
- Haven't you stolen enough from me?

10:59.742 --> 11:01.868
Back off, bow tie!

11:07.124 --> 11:10.085
Hey, guys, what do you think?

11:10.920 --> 11:12.379
Wow, Penny, good job.

11:12.546 --> 11:15.256
Thanks. Target, 4.99.
I'm getting a drink.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.928
- What are you working on?
- I'm making a necklace for my mom.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.096
That's sweet.

11:21.263 --> 11:23.306
Yeah, she and my dad are
going through a bit of a rough patch,

11:23.474 --> 11:25.892
so I wanted to do something to let
her know I was thinking about her.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.185
What's going on with them?

11:27.353 --> 11:29.771
They're just having
a little trouble communicating.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.107
My dad says it's because
the sound of my mom's voice

11:32.274 --> 11:34.275
makes him want to tear his ears off
and sew them over his eyes

11:34.443 --> 11:35.923
so he never has to look at her again.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.073
- Hi.
- Hey, guys.

11:40.241 --> 11:43.493
Look who's here to put
the "Jew" in "Jewelry Night."

11:46.872 --> 11:49.165
Oh, sure,
so it's fine when you say it.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.210
Sorry we're late.
I wanted to swing by the lab

11:52.378 --> 11:55.463
and pick up some even
cooler tools for us to use.

11:55.631 --> 11:58.091
- I didn't know you were coming again.
- Well, last week was a blast.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.844
Plus, I thought you might
like having a guy here.

12:04.765 --> 12:06.307
It was not funny.

12:07.643 --> 12:08.852
So, what tools did you bring?

12:09.019 --> 12:10.620
Everything we need
to make jewelry molds.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.355
Here's some silver, a crucible

12:12.523 --> 12:14.399
and an acetylene torch
to melt it down.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.401
Ooh! That looks like fun.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.654
Maybe you should master glue
before you move on to fire.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.323
Okay, who's up first?

12:22.491 --> 12:25.660
Rajesh, want to make a bracelet
for your mom to go with the necklace?

12:25.828 --> 12:27.162
No, thanks.

12:27.329 --> 12:28.872
I was gonna make
a necklace for my mom,

12:29.039 --> 12:30.999
but unfortunately,
she doesn't have a neck.

12:33.002 --> 12:36.379
She's just chins and fat and feet.

12:40.676 --> 12:42.302
Okay, we're almost ready to go.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.679
Once we bond the wires,
we can test the tubes.

12:44.847 --> 12:47.766
This is so exciting, I feel...

12:47.933 --> 12:49.934
like I'm 75 again.

12:54.690 --> 12:55.732
Oh, God.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.108
What... what is it?

12:57.276 --> 13:00.069
Sheldon just sent me a picture of him
and Bill Nye getting smoothies.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.534
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, sure.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.120
Why do you put up with Sheldon?

13:10.039 --> 13:11.039
Oh.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.874
You know, because we're friends.

13:15.252 --> 13:17.128
Why?

13:18.631 --> 13:20.298
Wow, you ask really hard questions.

13:20.466 --> 13:21.758
Yeah.

13:21.926 --> 13:24.135
Look, I know he can be aggravating,

13:24.303 --> 13:27.096
but what you have to remember is that
he's not doing it on purpose.

13:27.264 --> 13:28.515
It's just how he is.

13:28.682 --> 13:31.643
But he's also loyal and trustworthy

13:31.811 --> 13:33.228
and we have fun together.

13:33.395 --> 13:36.648
You know you're describing a dog.

13:38.692 --> 13:39.901
He did bite me once.

13:42.071 --> 13:45.073
But in his defense, I came up
behind him while he was eating.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.867
Yeah, they hate that.

13:50.079 --> 13:54.332
You know what, Sheldon is the
smartest person I have ever met.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.793
He's a little broken
and he needs me.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.088
I guess I need him, too.

14:00.756 --> 14:01.756
Why is that?

14:02.508 --> 14:04.384
Boy, you will not
let this go, will you?

14:07.263 --> 14:08.513
Oh, geez.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.265
Another photo from Sheldon?

14:10.432 --> 14:11.766
No, I have to go pick him up.

14:11.934 --> 14:14.143
Bill Nye ditched him
at the smoothie place.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.189
He probably stole his wallet, too.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.362
You know, if you guys are interested,

14:24.530 --> 14:26.771
there's a technique
where I can take a lock of your hair,

14:26.866 --> 14:30.076
refine it into carbon dust,
and use the hydraulic press at work

14:30.244 --> 14:33.329
to turn it into a tiny little diamond
with your DNA in it.

14:33.497 --> 14:34.998
Oh, that's amazing!

14:35.165 --> 14:36.565
Yeah. See Bernie's engagement ring?

14:36.667 --> 14:39.127
That came right off my mom's back.

14:40.796 --> 14:41.963
He's kidding.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.632
If that were true,
it'd be so much bigger.

14:46.844 --> 14:49.005
"My name is Howard.
I can make your hair into diamonds.

14:49.096 --> 14:52.807
My mom is morbidly obese.
Everybody love me."

14:53.934 --> 14:55.602
Whoa, where is that coming from?

14:55.769 --> 14:57.770
I'll tell you where it's coming from.

14:57.938 --> 14:59.647
All you do is make fun of me
for coming to girls' night,

14:59.815 --> 15:01.535
and now you're here ruining it
for everyone.

15:01.609 --> 15:05.278
Raj, cool it.
He's gonna make us hair diamonds.

15:06.196 --> 15:07.488
How am I ruining anything?

15:07.656 --> 15:09.536
I'm just trying to help you
make better jewelry.

15:09.658 --> 15:11.409
But this isn't about the jewelry.

15:11.577 --> 15:15.038
This is about me having a place where
I can open up about my feelings.

15:15.664 --> 15:18.458
Since when can't you open up
with me?

15:18.626 --> 15:19.959
There are just some things

15:20.127 --> 15:21.794
that I feel more comfortable
sharing with the girls,

15:21.962 --> 15:23.671
because they won't make fun of me

15:23.839 --> 15:27.800
or and call me names, or ask me if my
"Koothrapanties are in a bunch."

15:31.513 --> 15:34.098
Buddy, I was just joking around.

15:34.266 --> 15:35.975
Yeah, well,
sometimes your jokes hurt.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.478
You're right.

15:38.646 --> 15:41.356
I didn't realize
I was making you feel that way.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.568
It was very brave of you to tell me.

15:45.736 --> 15:47.028
Thank you.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.405
It wasn't easy.

15:50.574 --> 15:53.534
They're gonna have sex
before Sheldon and I do. I knew it.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.376
- Arthur.
- Hi, Sheldon.

16:01.543 --> 16:03.169
I'm surprised to see you here.

16:03.337 --> 16:04.879
Yeah, me, too.

16:05.047 --> 16:07.090
Somewhere around the third floor,

16:07.257 --> 16:10.343
I began to see a white light.

16:12.721 --> 16:13.763
I'll get Leonard.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.515
No, no, no, I'm...

16:15.683 --> 16:17.475
I'm here to see you.

16:17.643 --> 16:21.604
If you're hoping to get in touch
with Bill Nye, I can't help you.

16:21.772 --> 16:25.066
I've been informed that he's now
Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy.

16:27.569 --> 16:31.447
No, I'm... I was thinking,
if it isn't too much trouble,

16:31.615 --> 16:34.784
I'd like to get your opinion
about my paper.

16:35.953 --> 16:37.996
Thank you. It would be an honor.

16:38.831 --> 16:39.831
Oh, great.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.582
Well, actually, I don't need that.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.293
I hacked into your e-mail
account and read it.

16:45.879 --> 16:47.880
And... what did you think?

16:48.048 --> 16:50.299
Well, first, I think the fact

16:50.467 --> 16:55.013
that you use your birthday
as a password is embarrassing.

16:56.390 --> 16:57.640
Thank you.

16:59.309 --> 17:01.019
Second...

17:01.186 --> 17:03.187
I thought your paper was inspired.

17:04.398 --> 17:06.691
Oh, well, that...
that means a lot to me.

17:07.609 --> 17:08.860
Can I invite you in for tea?

17:09.445 --> 17:12.447
No, no. I really... I have to run.

17:12.614 --> 17:13.698
Hey, Arthur. How are you?

17:13.866 --> 17:15.658
Well, I guess one cup wouldn't hurt.

17:24.668 --> 17:25.793
Hey, buddy, what's up?

17:25.961 --> 17:28.588
Well, I was feeling bad
about how I acted the other night

17:28.756 --> 17:30.882
so I made you a little something.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.551
- You didn't have to do that.
- Well, it was fun.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.887
I used some of the jewelry techniques
you taught us.

17:39.016 --> 17:41.851
It's a lightsaber belt buckle.

17:43.103 --> 17:44.812
This is so cool. Thanks.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.898
It gets better.

17:50.569 --> 17:51.694
Wow!

17:51.862 --> 17:52.862
And that's not even the best part.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.280
See?

17:54.448 --> 17:56.616
I have one, too.

17:58.952 --> 17:59.952
Check it out.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.204
You can wear yours,

18:01.330 --> 18:03.831
and we can have little sword fights
whenever we want.

18:17.471 --> 18:20.223
Yeah, and my eighth favorite
episode of Professor Proton

18:20.390 --> 18:21.974
was "Alka-Seltzer Rocket."

18:22.142 --> 18:24.685
You said, "Plop, plop, fizz, fizz,

18:24.853 --> 18:26.979
oh, what a blast-off it is."

18:28.440 --> 18:30.441
Remember?
Remember that? Remember?

18:32.027 --> 18:34.362
He can't help it.
He can't. He really can't.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.364
Wait here,
I'll get some Alka-Seltzer,

18:36.532 --> 18:38.407
we can build that rocket,

18:38.534 --> 18:41.285
and we can shoot it
at Bill Nye's house.

18:41.411 --> 18:43.204
As long as I'm not
within 500 feet of it.

18:48.877 --> 18:50.211
So, you...

18:50.379 --> 18:52.588
you have... you have any...

18:52.756 --> 18:54.549
single grandmothers?

18:57.052 --> 18:58.344
Sorry, they're both married.

18:58.512 --> 18:59.679
Good.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.183
Ha... ha...

19:04.309 --> 19:05.726
happily?
