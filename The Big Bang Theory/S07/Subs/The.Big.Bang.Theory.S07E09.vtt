WEBVTT

00:03.920 --> 00:05.087
The math is all there.

00:05.255 --> 00:07.131
- It's not real.
- Yes, it is.

00:07.298 --> 00:10.384
Look.
It is scientifically impossible

00:10.552 --> 00:12.428
for a person to tip a cow.

00:13.722 --> 00:15.180
Even you, with your stocky build

00:15.348 --> 00:17.108
and lumberjack shoulders,
you couldn't do it.

00:18.727 --> 00:21.127
It's horrible. Why would you push
a cow over? They're sacred.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.271
Oh, stop it.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.273
I've seen you eat,
like, a million hamburgers.

00:24.441 --> 00:27.109
Hey, an animal can be both
sacred and delicious.

00:28.278 --> 00:30.029
Look, I'm telling you
I've done it, okay?

00:30.196 --> 00:31.780
I clearly remember
the cow standing up

00:31.948 --> 00:33.282
and then the cow on its side.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.242
Were you drunk?

00:35.410 --> 00:38.787
I was 16 in Nebraska.
What do you think?

00:38.955 --> 00:41.707
I think you're the one who fell over.

00:41.875 --> 00:45.794
That would explain why the sky
was also on its side.

00:46.504 --> 00:48.422
- Hey.
- Howard.

00:48.590 --> 00:49.965
Real or not?

00:50.133 --> 00:52.342
I'm going to say... not.

00:52.510 --> 00:54.428
That's just based on me
trying to roll

00:54.596 --> 00:56.722
my mom over when she's snoring.

00:57.932 --> 01:00.809
Speaking of that big side of beef,

01:00.977 --> 01:04.271
she's invited all of you
to Thanksgiving at her house.

01:04.731 --> 01:05.939
Mmm.

01:07.275 --> 01:08.995
You know, I've been told
that a bald refusal

01:09.152 --> 01:11.320
of an invitation is rude
and one must instead

01:11.488 --> 01:13.155
offer up a polite excuse, so...

01:13.323 --> 01:15.616
I'd love to go, but, unfortunately,

01:15.784 --> 01:17.659
that sounds awful.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.956
Come on, it'll be fun.

01:23.124 --> 01:24.291
We were actually
going to do it here.

01:24.459 --> 01:26.043
Please?
Bernadette's bringing her dad,

01:26.211 --> 01:27.169
because her mom's out of town,

01:27.337 --> 01:29.296
and I never have anything
to say to that guy.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.673
Since you put it that way,
I'd love to go,

01:31.841 --> 01:33.550
but that sounds even more awful.

01:34.552 --> 01:35.886
It'd actually be nice to not hear

01:36.054 --> 01:37.694
Sheldon complain
about my cooking all day.

01:37.847 --> 01:39.056
Excuse me,

01:39.224 --> 01:41.934
but every year
you prepare a terrible meal

01:42.102 --> 01:44.061
and every year I criticize it.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.563
Do our traditions
mean nothing to you?

01:48.733 --> 01:50.150
- I want to go.
- Yeah, me, too.

01:50.318 --> 01:51.527
- I'm in.
- Sheldon.

01:51.694 --> 01:53.987
Fine, I'll go.

01:54.155 --> 01:56.406
But if her food is delicious,
Thanksgiving is ruined,

01:56.574 --> 01:57.741
and it's on you.

02:25.270 --> 02:27.729
Do we really have to go
to Mrs. Wolowitz's house?

02:28.273 --> 02:29.439
We do.

02:29.607 --> 02:32.276
And I expect you
to be on your best behavior.

02:32.443 --> 02:35.696
Now I know how the
African slaves felt.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.699
Being dragged from their homes

02:38.867 --> 02:42.077
to labor under the
yoke of the white man.

02:42.245 --> 02:45.247
Are you honestly comparing
Thanksgiving dinner

02:45.415 --> 02:48.041
at Wolowitz's mom's with
one of the greatest tragedies

02:48.209 --> 02:49.918
in the history of mankind?

02:50.336 --> 02:51.837
Yes.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.006
Sheldon, you can have
a nice Thanksgiving anywhere.

02:55.049 --> 02:56.341
I spent one in Vegas.

02:56.509 --> 02:57.509
You did?

02:57.510 --> 02:59.344
Yeah, back when I was dating Zack.

02:59.512 --> 03:01.073
It was actually more fun
than I thought.

03:01.139 --> 03:03.515
We gambled, we went to one
of those cheesy wedding chapels,

03:03.683 --> 03:05.142
we had a really good
turkey dinner.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.811
Which was surprising,
since we were at a strip club.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.231
Wait, you went to a chapel?

03:11.399 --> 03:12.608
- Yeah.
- Why?

03:12.775 --> 03:15.694
We had one of those
silly fake weddings.

03:19.449 --> 03:20.532
Penny...

03:20.700 --> 03:22.743
you know those are real, right?

03:22.911 --> 03:24.328
No, they're not.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.581
Yeah, they are.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.666
No, they're not.

03:30.979 --> 03:31.979
Yeah, they are.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.420
- He's right.
- They're real.

03:34.923 --> 03:38.008
But it... didn't seem real.

03:38.968 --> 03:40.177
Let me ask you a question.

03:40.345 --> 03:45.098
At any point,
was Las Vegas on its side?

03:49.729 --> 03:51.980
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, honey. Mm.

03:52.899 --> 03:55.901
Oh, you brought beer
for everybody.

03:56.069 --> 03:59.571
Okay.
Yeah, it's for everybody.

04:01.616 --> 04:04.159
I really just wanted to have
a nice, quiet day at home

04:04.327 --> 04:05.494
and watch the game.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.955
You can have a quiet day
and watch the game here.

04:08.122 --> 04:11.625
Howard,
the medicine's not working!

04:12.710 --> 04:14.544
You just took it.

04:14.712 --> 04:17.214
At least let it
reach your first stomach!

04:21.427 --> 04:22.844
Hey, Mike.

04:23.012 --> 04:24.093
Let me help you out, there.

04:24.222 --> 04:26.181
Thanks.
What's wrong with your mom?

04:26.349 --> 04:27.557
Oh, her gout's flaring up.

04:27.725 --> 04:30.894
Turns out an apple pie a day
does not keep the doctor away.

04:32.230 --> 04:35.148
How can
one little toe hurt so bad?

04:35.984 --> 04:40.195
Maybe because that little piggy
is being crushed by the barn!

04:41.990 --> 04:43.907
She should quiet down soon.

04:44.075 --> 04:47.077
I gave her enough pain meds
to choke a... well, her.

04:49.580 --> 04:51.540
I guess we're going to
have to do all the cooking.

04:51.582 --> 04:52.582
I have a better idea.

04:52.750 --> 04:53.917
If you think you're
going to make me

04:54.085 --> 04:55.485
do all this by myself,
you're crazy.

04:55.545 --> 04:57.305
I was going to make Raj
do it all by himself.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.839
Oh, well, that's a great idea.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.719
No traffic, we're sailing.

05:03.886 --> 05:06.847
Yes. Like we're on a ship.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.559
Coming from Africa to America.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.355
Sheldon, that's
completely inappropriate.

05:15.523 --> 05:18.400
You can't keep comparing
yourself to a slave.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.069
Yes, Miss Amy.

05:24.198 --> 05:25.958
I can't believe you're
married to that idiot.

05:26.075 --> 05:28.410
Would you stop?
We just did it as a goof.

05:28.578 --> 05:29.953
Well, a goof or not,
you're actually married.

05:30.121 --> 05:31.747
You need to get
this taken care of.

05:31.914 --> 05:34.207
I will. Why are you
making this such a big deal?

05:34.375 --> 05:36.376
Oh! I have a reason.

05:36.544 --> 05:39.254
It could be because
you said yes to marrying Zack,

05:39.422 --> 05:40.922
but every time
Leonard's proposed,

05:41.090 --> 05:42.591
he's gotten a resounding no.

05:44.594 --> 05:47.596
That's just off the top of my head.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.431
So how do I undo this?

05:49.599 --> 05:50.999
I'm hoping you can
get an annulment,

05:51.100 --> 05:52.500
so it's just like
it never happened.

05:52.643 --> 05:54.186
Great, well, what do I have to do?

05:54.354 --> 05:55.854
It says here
you can get an annulment

05:56.022 --> 05:57.702
if any of the following
conditions are met.

05:57.815 --> 05:59.649
"Were you unable
to consummate the marriage?"

05:59.817 --> 06:01.485
Penny? Next.

06:03.613 --> 06:06.114
"Is there any evidence
of fraud, bigamy,

06:06.282 --> 06:07.699
want of understanding?"

06:07.867 --> 06:08.867
'Want of understanding?'

06:08.910 --> 06:09.910
What does that even mean?

06:09.952 --> 06:11.661
Ding, ding, ding.
We have a winner.

06:14.165 --> 06:15.540
Thanks for saving the day.

06:15.708 --> 06:16.708
No problem.

06:16.834 --> 06:17.915
It wouldn't be Thanksgiving

06:18.002 --> 06:21.171
without an Indian
providing the food.

06:22.799 --> 06:25.008
Now, where does your mom
keep the Crisco?

06:25.176 --> 06:26.176
I don't know.

06:26.302 --> 06:28.136
Probably in a wad in her cheek.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.432
I'll help Raj in here.
Why don't you go keep my dad company?

06:32.600 --> 06:34.893
Oh, he doesn't want me in there.
I'm the creepy little guy

06:35.061 --> 06:37.354
who has sex with his daughter.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.817
- Don't be silly, he loves you.
- Does he?

06:41.984 --> 06:44.361
- Okay, he cares about you a lot.
- Really?

06:44.529 --> 06:47.614
I do crap for you all the time.
Get out there.

06:53.246 --> 06:56.456
So your wife's in Arizona
with the grandkids?

06:56.874 --> 06:57.874
Uh-huh.

07:01.003 --> 07:03.088
You know, my mom's been to Arizona.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.799
She rode one of those mules
down in the Grand Canyon.

07:05.967 --> 07:08.635
Long story short,
they had to shoot it.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.100
Because she's so fat.

07:19.605 --> 07:22.065
I'll get the door
while you finish laughing.

07:25.361 --> 07:27.696
- Hey, guys.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.281
It smells wonderful.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.533
Is anyone slaving away
in the kitchen?

07:31.701 --> 07:33.160
- Because I, too, know...
- Sheldon.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.122
Here. Thank you for having us.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.290
What's with you?

07:38.332 --> 07:39.374
She's mad at me

07:39.542 --> 07:41.710
because she just found out
she's married to Zack.

07:41.878 --> 07:42.878
Really?

07:42.879 --> 07:44.713
That dumb-ass you used to date?

07:44.881 --> 07:47.299
That's hysterical.

07:48.634 --> 07:50.969
I can't believe I felt bad
for opening this in the car.

07:56.934 --> 07:57.934
You need any help?

07:58.019 --> 08:00.395
Yeah, can you reach
that gravy boat up there?

08:00.688 --> 08:01.897
- Uh, sure.
- Great.

08:02.064 --> 08:03.315
That makes one of you.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.904
Okay we have a lot to do
and not much time to do it.

08:09.071 --> 08:11.490
Bernadette, you're on corn,
gravy and yam detail.

08:11.657 --> 08:12.978
Amy, you're on rolls, cranberries

08:13.075 --> 08:15.435
and making sure Bernadette stays
away from the marshmallows.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.455
That's right, I see you.

08:20.249 --> 08:21.489
Okay if you have any questions,

08:21.501 --> 08:23.418
I'll be over here
basting my ass off.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.003
Focus is key.

08:25.254 --> 08:28.131
Did you guys know Penny
married Zack three years ago?

08:28.299 --> 08:30.091
- What?
- Wha...?

08:35.598 --> 08:36.932
You ever play football?

08:37.099 --> 08:38.558
A little in college.

08:38.726 --> 08:40.727
- You?
- No.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.563
But I did get tackled
in the hallway once.

08:45.399 --> 08:48.276
The whole school cheered.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.155
I found the, court papers

08:52.323 --> 08:53.684
that you and Zack
need to fill out.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.463
- I'll print them when we get home.
- Fine.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.661
And we can just put this
whole thing behind us.

08:57.828 --> 08:58.620
Are you done?

08:58.788 --> 09:00.455
- What?
- Look, I get it, I screwed up.

09:00.581 --> 09:02.249
Is this all we're going to talk
about the rest of the day?

09:02.291 --> 09:03.375
Why are you mad at me?

09:03.543 --> 09:04.834
You're the one that
did the stupid thing.

09:04.961 --> 09:07.754
- I'm just trying to fix it.
- I need some air.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.631
Well... Penny.

09:09.799 --> 09:11.600
Now, I don't know the
first thing about women,

09:11.676 --> 09:13.510
but I would not follow her.

09:16.472 --> 09:18.723
Listen to Stretch.

09:24.772 --> 09:25.939
How am I the bad guy?

09:26.107 --> 09:28.692
She's the one who married
someone else. I'm the victim.

09:28.859 --> 09:31.903
Sounds like Zack's the victim.
You're sleeping with his wife.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.534
I've kept my marriage
together for 35 years.

09:37.702 --> 09:39.035
Can I weigh in here?

09:39.203 --> 09:40.203
Sure.

09:40.329 --> 09:42.372
I'm trying to watch the game.
Shut up.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.253
How do you not make
a first down there?

09:48.421 --> 09:50.005
They passed against
a nickel defense.

09:50.172 --> 09:51.965
They should have run it off-tackle.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.428
How the hell do you know that?

09:56.596 --> 09:58.054
My father loved football.

09:58.222 --> 09:59.806
He always made me watch it

09:59.974 --> 10:01.558
before I was allowed
to do my homework.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.393
Well...

10:03.603 --> 10:05.103
You'll be happy to know
I just spoke to Zack

10:05.271 --> 10:06.911
and he's willing to
sign the court papers.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.106
He's on his way here now.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.942
- Wait, you invited him here?
- Yeah.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.777
I'm getting ready
to weigh in again.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.070
Come on.

10:15.531 --> 10:18.158
What do you think
they ought to do now?

10:18.326 --> 10:20.452
I would throw a quick slant
to a wide-out,

10:20.620 --> 10:22.912
given that the defense
is showing blitz.

10:23.080 --> 10:26.207
Oh, I love a good blitz,
especially with sour cream.

10:29.378 --> 10:30.378
Get it?

10:30.546 --> 10:32.922
Because it sounds like "blintz."

10:33.841 --> 10:36.217
Did someone say blintz?

10:37.386 --> 10:38.386
I just don't understand

10:38.512 --> 10:39.846
why you invited him here today.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.264
Because you wouldn't
shut up about it.

10:41.390 --> 10:42.599
When I called him,
he had nothing to do,

10:42.683 --> 10:43.558
so I just thought it would...

10:43.643 --> 10:45.268
Hey, guys, I'm trying
to cook in here.

10:45.436 --> 10:46.603
Oh, sorry.
We'll keep it down.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.647
No, no, speak up.

10:49.565 --> 10:50.815
I'm about to use the blender,

10:50.983 --> 10:52.776
and I don't want to miss anything.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.528
Well, you might have
to cook for one more

10:55.696 --> 10:56.738
because she invited Zack.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.740
- What?
- What?

10:59.909 --> 11:01.534
My, my.

11:01.702 --> 11:05.288
The plot, like my gravy, thickens.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.753
I don't care for your
mother's bathroom.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.922
There's not an angle
to do one's business

11:14.090 --> 11:16.758
without a clown figurine
staring at you.

11:18.094 --> 11:22.514
- That's why I sit.
- Yeah, that's why.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.102
You remember
the Thanksgiving game

11:27.269 --> 11:29.104
when it snowed in Dallas?

11:29.271 --> 11:32.732
Nineteen-ninety three. Leon Lett blew
the game in the final seconds

11:32.900 --> 11:34.693
and the Dolphins
emerged victorious.

11:34.860 --> 11:37.696
Then I finally got to do
my calculus.

11:37.863 --> 11:41.157
I was so pissed,
I wanted to shoot my TV.

11:41.325 --> 11:43.118
So was my dad.

11:43.285 --> 11:44.369
And then he did.

11:46.455 --> 11:48.248
- Anyone need a beer?
- Yeah.

11:48.416 --> 11:49.833
Thank God.

11:50.793 --> 11:53.586
So, does your dad
still live in Texas?

11:53.754 --> 11:56.339
No.
He died when I was 14.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.384
I'm sorry to hear that.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.803
So was the man who owned
the local liquor store.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.473
He cried and cried.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.561
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

12:10.479 --> 12:13.148
So, if your dad died
when you were 14,

12:13.315 --> 12:16.067
you were never old enough
to have a beer with the man.

12:16.485 --> 12:17.485
No, sir.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.530
He did try to give me one
for my high school graduation,

12:20.698 --> 12:22.907
but I was 11 and my mom said, no.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.039
Well, you're having one with me.

12:35.337 --> 12:36.337
All right.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.258
To your dad.

12:44.013 --> 12:47.474
I never had a beer
with my dad, either.

12:51.103 --> 12:53.188
Do you mind?
We're having a moment here.

13:01.572 --> 13:03.698
I can't believe Penny's
married to Zack.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.366
I wonder what she saw in that guy.

13:05.534 --> 13:06.868
I don't know.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.870
He's sweet, he's tall, handsome.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.580
Broad shoulders, good hair.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.624
Hmm, wonder what she
sees in Leonard.

13:16.629 --> 13:17.921
How's it going out there?

13:18.088 --> 13:21.466
Sheldon and your dad are bonding
and completely ignoring me.

13:21.842 --> 13:23.760
I know how you feel.

13:23.928 --> 13:27.222
Sheldon ignored me for a week
when he got that Roomba vacuum.

13:29.183 --> 13:31.309
I kick it when he's not looking.

13:33.562 --> 13:34.562
What are they doing?

13:34.855 --> 13:37.315
They're drinking beer
and watching football.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.108
So why don't you do that
with them?

13:39.318 --> 13:41.611
- They don't want me.
- What do you mean?

13:43.280 --> 13:45.406
Well, Sheldon started talking
about how his dad isn't alive anymore,

13:45.574 --> 13:46.908
and they were toasting,
and I tried to tell them

13:47.034 --> 13:48.754
about how sad I was
when my dad abandoned...

13:48.828 --> 13:50.078
Zack's here!

13:50.913 --> 13:52.872
Stir the gravy.

13:55.459 --> 13:57.460
Sorry. I really want
to hear how sad you are.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.629
I'll be back in, like, five, ten minutes.

14:04.343 --> 14:06.469
Sorry she made you come
over here on a holiday.

14:06.637 --> 14:08.555
It's all right.
I didn't have anything going on.

14:08.722 --> 14:10.139
Plus, Penny told me we're married,

14:10.307 --> 14:12.851
and Thanksgiving's a time
to be with family.

14:13.811 --> 14:14.853
Yeah, okay great.

14:14.979 --> 14:15.812
Can we just get this over with?

14:15.980 --> 14:19.190
Yeah, you guys
have to sign here and here.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.025
On Monday,
we'll file for the annulment,

14:21.193 --> 14:22.694
and this "marriage" will be over.

14:22.862 --> 14:23.903
Okay.

14:25.197 --> 14:26.698
I don't know if I want to sign it.

14:26.907 --> 14:28.575
Ooh!

14:30.870 --> 14:32.120
Why won't you sign it?

14:32.288 --> 14:35.540
I just think splitting up
can be rough on kids.

14:36.917 --> 14:38.001
We don't have any kids.

14:38.168 --> 14:39.627
Are you sure?
Because you didn't know

14:39.795 --> 14:41.546
we were married
until this morning.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.133
Okay, look, Zack, come on.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.302
You know neither of us
thought this was real.

14:47.469 --> 14:49.554
I mean, we were married
by an Elvis impersonator.

14:49.763 --> 14:51.084
Of course it was an impersonator.

14:51.181 --> 14:53.892
We could never afford
a real Elvis.

14:57.062 --> 14:59.272
You married him instead of me?

14:59.440 --> 15:01.065
Good call.

15:01.233 --> 15:02.650
Sign the papers.

15:02.818 --> 15:03.943
Hang on.
You know what?

15:04.111 --> 15:05.820
You have been a jerk
about this all day.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.322
You always do this!
Whenever I mess up,

15:07.489 --> 15:09.324
you're right there to make me
feel even worse about it.

15:09.491 --> 15:10.491
That is not true.

15:10.576 --> 15:11.576
We could've waited till Monday,

15:11.744 --> 15:13.119
signed the papers,
this all would have been over.

15:13.287 --> 15:14.704
You're the one who
invited him here.

15:14.872 --> 15:15.997
There you go again.
Just another mistake

15:16.040 --> 15:17.332
you're throwing in my face.

15:17.499 --> 15:19.250
Not cool, bro.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.337
I'm starting to think

15:22.504 --> 15:25.006
you're not the kind of guy
I want dating my wife.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.345
Yeah, well, she's not going to
be your wife for long.

15:30.554 --> 15:32.138
Oh, no.
Are you dying?

15:34.308 --> 15:35.850
I'm about to.
Sign the paper.

15:38.312 --> 15:42.148
"Happy wife, happy life."

15:43.442 --> 15:44.484
Let's eat.

15:48.405 --> 15:53.284
Two, three, eight, four, six.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.122
That's all I can do
without throwing up.

15:59.416 --> 16:00.875
That is not what I expected

16:01.043 --> 16:04.003
when you said you
were going to burp "pi."

16:05.214 --> 16:07.924
Did somebody say pie?

16:08.926 --> 16:10.385
I don't know what's scarier:

16:10.552 --> 16:11.886
the bathroom clowns,

16:12.054 --> 16:14.847
or the woman
that put them there.

16:15.891 --> 16:19.560
All I know is you can
only fit one of her in a car.

16:22.731 --> 16:24.440
And there's the clown
that came out of her.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.739
I really didn't want
to come here,

16:31.907 --> 16:33.658
but this is shaping up to be

16:33.826 --> 16:36.202
one of the best Thanksgivings
I've had in a long time.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.870
Me, too.

16:38.622 --> 16:41.457
Hey. Howard says you've
been making fun of him all day!

16:41.625 --> 16:44.460
Now, both of you apologize right now!

16:45.337 --> 16:46.963
She's so tiny.

16:51.093 --> 16:53.261
It's funny when she's mad.

16:56.807 --> 16:58.224
All right, mister, I think you owe

16:58.392 --> 17:01.227
Howard and Bernadette an apology.

17:02.479 --> 17:03.855
Perhaps you're right.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.650
I'm sorry for my behavior.

17:07.818 --> 17:09.861
I've had alcohol,
and it's caused me

17:10.029 --> 17:11.070
to be inappropriate.

17:11.238 --> 17:13.072
- It's okay.
- Don't worry about it.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.615
Thank you.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.659
Ain't she great?

17:17.745 --> 17:18.786
Sheldon.

17:19.079 --> 17:21.247
Now, how's about you get
us a couple of beers?

17:34.887 --> 17:36.054
Thanks again for cooking.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.555
Yeah, everything was delicious.

17:37.723 --> 17:41.642
Well, I couldn't have done it
without my two favorite girls.

17:41.810 --> 17:44.479
Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray.

17:48.275 --> 17:50.777
Hey, Sheldon,
what do you say we go outside

17:50.944 --> 17:52.987
and throw around the old pigskin?

17:53.864 --> 17:55.239
This is a Jewish house.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.617
I don't think they have pigskin.

17:59.828 --> 18:02.205
Did someone say pigskin?

18:04.249 --> 18:06.334
Hey, I'm sorry about today.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.461
And I promise,
next time I get married,

18:08.629 --> 18:09.754
it won't be a joke.

18:09.838 --> 18:11.631
It'll be for love.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.424
Or money.

18:16.887 --> 18:18.054
I'm sorry, too.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.014
Don't be.
It's my fault.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.641
I was a terrible husband.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.478
I was never around.

18:27.731 --> 18:29.607
I know I'm hard on you,

18:29.775 --> 18:32.401
but you're not the worst
son-in-law in the world.

18:32.569 --> 18:35.321
Mike, that's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

18:35.489 --> 18:38.032
Well, I'm drunk.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.788
I just vomited on a lot of clowns.
