00:02.002 --> 00:03.669
Previously on The Big Bang Theory:

00:03.837 --> 00:07.339
- This is just a minor setback.
- No, it's not, okay?

00:07.507 --> 00:08.841
I've been out here for,
like, ten years.

00:09.009 --> 00:12.052
- I have nothing to show for it.
- Well, you have me.

00:14.305 --> 00:15.723
I do have you.

00:16.766 --> 00:18.392
Mmm.

00:22.272 --> 00:24.106
Leonard Hofstadter,

00:24.274 --> 00:25.858
will you marry me?

00:27.068 --> 00:28.694
Um...

00:31.031 --> 00:33.365
Did you seriously just say... umm?

00:34.993 --> 00:37.119
- It's an outrage.
- I know.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.568
The university, they think
they can do whatever they want.

00:39.622 --> 00:41.123
We just have to sit
there and take it.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.531
You need to let it go, Sheldon.

00:42.625 --> 00:45.294
You work tirelessly for someone
and this is what you get.

00:45.462 --> 00:49.256
Oh, my God! They're just making
you use your vacation days!

00:50.967 --> 00:52.259
But I don't want a vacation.

00:52.427 --> 00:55.220
Okay, listen, I don't mean to
diminish what you're going through,

00:55.388 --> 00:57.139
but I'm a little
distracted right now.

00:57.307 --> 00:58.974
Oh, this again?

00:59.142 --> 01:01.435
So, Penny proposed,
you didn't say yes,

01:01.603 --> 01:03.683
and now you think you may
have lost her love forever.

01:03.813 --> 01:07.608
How does this compare to me being
forced to relax for a few days?

01:09.652 --> 01:11.987
- It doesn't!
- Thank you!

01:14.074 --> 01:15.532
I'm gonna go talk to Penny.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.869
I'm going to go inside,
put on my coziest pajamas,

01:19.037 --> 01:22.581
curl up with a good book and wait
for this nightmare to be over.

01:26.628 --> 01:28.337
Penny.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.385
Sorry.

01:37.639 --> 01:38.680
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:38.848 --> 01:40.140
Look, I'm sorry I
didn't text you back.

01:40.308 --> 01:41.642
I just needed
some time to think.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.852
- Okay.
- Here. Come in.

01:44.020 --> 01:45.896
Look, if you want
to break up, just say it.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.356
- Leonard...
- No, no, no. I take it back.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.441
Don't say it.
Just hate me, but stay with me.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.318
It worked for my parents.

01:53.488 --> 01:56.115
Listen, I don't want
to break up with you.

01:56.866 --> 01:58.367
Oh. Okay.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.536
Good, good.

02:00.703 --> 02:02.871
So it's cool if I cry a little?

02:04.541 --> 02:07.709
- Yeah, I probably wouldn't.
- Yeah.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.923
Look, you did the right thing
last night. I was a mess.

02:13.091 --> 02:15.332
I was just frustrated because
my career is going nowhere.

02:15.426 --> 02:17.219
Look, I get it,
and I want you to know

02:17.387 --> 02:19.888
that I support
whatever you want to do.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.932
Great, because
I've been thinking,

02:22.100 --> 02:23.433
if I really want this
acting thing to work,

02:23.601 --> 02:26.311
I need to focus all my energy on it.
And to do that,

02:26.479 --> 02:29.523
I should quit waitressing
at The Cheesecake Factory.

02:30.544 --> 02:31.544
Wow.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.402
- That's a big step.
- I know.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.696
So, you know, before
making any rash...

02:35.864 --> 02:37.865
- I already quit.
- And I support you.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.102
Come on, take me
to work with you.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.104
No. You're on vacation.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.732
Please? What if there's a big
breakthrough in science today

03:11.900 --> 03:13.066
and I'm not there to see it?

03:13.234 --> 03:14.484
Do you really think
there's gonna be a breakthrough

03:14.652 --> 03:18.030
- without you there to do it?
- No. I was just tricking you.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.782
Bye.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.119
Leonard, wait!

03:24.287 --> 03:26.246
- Take me with you.
- No!

03:27.040 --> 03:28.457
- Please.
- No!

03:28.625 --> 03:30.626
- Too bad. I'm coming with you.
- Sheldon, stay!

03:30.793 --> 03:32.586
- But...
- I said stay!

03:40.136 --> 03:41.803
I'm going to work.

03:41.971 --> 03:43.263
Do not follow me.

04:02.784 --> 04:03.951
Hey, Stuart.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.621
- Hey.
- Sorry. Did I startle you?

04:07.789 --> 04:11.124
Yes, but at this point, pretty
much any customer does.

04:12.001 --> 04:14.503
- What can I do for you?
- Well, I need a little help.

04:14.671 --> 04:17.271
I accidentally destroyed one of
Howard's comic books this morning,

04:17.423 --> 04:20.008
- and was hoping I could replace it.
- Wow. What happened?

04:20.176 --> 04:22.844
Batman got his ass kicked
by my curling iron.

04:24.847 --> 04:27.099
Don't let The Riddler know that.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.936
It's a comic book joke.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.189
Or maybe it's not.

04:35.149 --> 04:38.110
- Do you have this one?
- Well, it's pretty rare.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.320
Can you give me a few
days to track it down?

04:40.488 --> 04:43.365
I was kind of hoping to get it
before Howie comes home from work.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.334
- What's the hurry?
- Well, he's always saying

04:45.451 --> 04:47.452
I should be more careful
with my curling iron,

04:47.620 --> 04:48.954
and it seems like
a dangerous precedent

04:49.122 --> 04:51.331
to let him think he can be right.

04:52.542 --> 04:55.794
Well, I'll do what I can,
but I can't make any promises.

04:56.671 --> 05:00.507
You know, I do work
at a pharmaceutical company.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.426
If you can make this happen today,

05:02.593 --> 05:06.138
I can hook you up with anxiety
medication, antidepressants.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.723
Really.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.809
Do you have any of these?

05:15.732 --> 05:18.108
Hello, Mr. Rat Brain.

05:19.319 --> 05:23.280
Not so bitey without the rest of the
rat to back us up now, are we?

05:23.573 --> 05:25.240
...Anybody home?

05:25.491 --> 05:26.731
Hey, what brings you guys here?

05:26.868 --> 05:28.285
Well, we were just on our way
to lunch and wanted to see

05:28.453 --> 05:30.579
- if you'd like to join.
- Why?

05:30.747 --> 05:32.187
Because Sheldon's
not here this week,

05:32.332 --> 05:33.749
and you don't think I
have any other options?

05:33.916 --> 05:35.584
I'm just kidding.
I'll get my purse.

05:36.085 --> 05:38.420
Hi, Amy. I... Oh.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.348
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you had any company.

05:40.506 --> 05:43.050
That's okay.
Bert, this is Howard and Rajesh.

05:43.217 --> 05:44.259
Guys, this is Bert.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.587
- Hey. Good to see you.
- Hey.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.137
Anyway, I wanted to show you

05:47.305 --> 05:49.348
this tourmalinated quartz
that we got in the lab.

05:49.974 --> 05:51.266
This is so pretty.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.976
Bert works for the
geology department.

05:53.144 --> 05:56.938
Yeah. You know what geologists
and Bon Jovi have in common?

05:57.648 --> 05:59.483
You're both into rock?

06:01.527 --> 06:03.195
Yeah.

06:04.864 --> 06:08.367
- Well, see ya.
- You forgot your quartz.

06:09.118 --> 06:11.745
Oh, it's okay.
I want you to have it.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.247
Bye.

06:14.832 --> 06:16.041
He's nice.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.919
Yeah, he's nice
because he likes you.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.462
What?

06:20.630 --> 06:23.215
- No, he doesn't.
- He brought you a pretty rock.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.550
So? He does that every day...
Oh.

06:28.012 --> 06:29.221
You know, if you'd
rather skip lunch

06:29.389 --> 06:31.765
and hang out with your boyfriend,
Bert, it's totally okay.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.266
He's not my boyfriend.

06:33.434 --> 06:35.185
Are you sure?
He's tall, pale and awkward.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.646
That sounds like your type.

06:38.106 --> 06:40.816
Should someone as lonely as you
really be making fun of me?

06:40.983 --> 06:42.651
Yeah, grow up, Howard. God.

06:44.529 --> 06:47.114
What do I do?
I don't want to hurt his feelings.

06:47.281 --> 06:49.658
Maybe the problem is
he thinks you're available.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.201
Does he know
you're dating Sheldon?

06:51.369 --> 06:53.537
I guess it hasn't come up.

06:53.704 --> 06:55.580
There you go.

06:55.748 --> 06:58.250
And does Sheldon know
you're dating Sheldon?

07:00.837 --> 07:02.671
I'm sorry. Who are you dating?

07:03.589 --> 07:05.590
Yeah, knock it off, Howard!

07:15.017 --> 07:17.978
- Oh, hey, Sheldon.
- Hello.

07:25.069 --> 07:26.653
You okay?

07:26.821 --> 07:29.489
I'm on vacation.
What do you think?

07:31.033 --> 07:32.617
Why are you sitting
in the stairwell?

07:33.744 --> 07:35.745
Leonard told me to stay.

07:36.831 --> 07:38.206
Oh.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.459
Well, good boy.

07:41.669 --> 07:43.870
- Where are you going?
- I have a ton of errands to run.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.922
I need to make copies of my
headshot, send them off to agents

07:46.090 --> 07:47.841
and sign up for a new
acting class.

07:48.009 --> 07:51.011
- Well, have fun.
- Okay.

07:57.685 --> 07:59.853
- You want to come with me?
- Really?

08:00.897 --> 08:03.315
Come on, boy. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.066
Get in the car. Come on.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.696
All right, thanks a lot.

08:10.448 --> 08:11.990
They have one at Capital Comics.

08:12.158 --> 08:15.827
- That's great.
- No, it's not. I hate that place.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.829
Guy who owns it is a jerk.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.831
He's always making me
feel bad about myself.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.000
That's terrible.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.419
What's the address?

08:25.880 --> 08:26.963
You know, why don't I
just take you there?

08:27.131 --> 08:28.715
That way, I can make sure
he doesn't rip you off.

08:28.883 --> 08:30.717
Thanks, but I don't
want you to close up.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.928
I mean, won't you lose business?

08:35.681 --> 08:37.766
Sorry. That was mean.

08:41.103 --> 08:42.704
Penny really quit
The Cheesecake Factory?

08:42.855 --> 08:44.898
- Yeah.
- So what is she doing today?

08:45.066 --> 08:47.192
I don't know. She already
thinks I don't support this,

08:47.360 --> 08:49.778
so if I call, it might look like
I'm checking up on her.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.072
- Well, do you support this?
- Of course I do.

08:52.240 --> 08:55.450
She's a great actress.
I'm proud she's taking this risk.

08:55.618 --> 08:59.079
- That's nice.
- You bought that? Great!

09:01.707 --> 09:04.167
I got to call her before
I forget how I said it.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.003
Hey.

09:07.171 --> 09:08.964
- Hi. What's up?
- How's it going?

09:09.131 --> 09:10.423
You taking Hollywood by storm?

09:10.591 --> 09:11.925
Actually,
I'm at The Cheesecake Factory.

09:12.093 --> 09:14.427
You got your job back.
That is great news.

09:14.595 --> 09:17.514
I didn't want to say anything,
but you are making the right choice.

09:17.682 --> 09:20.475
To plunge yourself into debt right
now would be literally insane.

09:20.643 --> 09:23.186
Yeah. I'm just
returning my uniform.

09:25.898 --> 09:27.983
And I support you.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.992
Before we begin your
guided meditation,

09:37.159 --> 09:40.745
close your eyes and picture
yourself in a peaceful environment.

09:41.539 --> 09:42.998
Okay.

09:44.375 --> 09:48.003
I'm inside the CERN super collider.

09:49.547 --> 09:52.674
Now, take a deep, relaxing
breath in through your nose.

09:55.052 --> 09:56.845
And let it out.

09:57.013 --> 09:59.097
Wow. Didn't see that coming.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.183
In.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.353
Let me guess.

10:05.521 --> 10:07.188
And out.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.650
What was I gonna do?
Two "ins" in a row?

10:15.615 --> 10:18.199
- Where's my lemonade?
- I didn't get it.

10:18.367 --> 10:21.369
A fitting swan song
to your career as a waitress

10:21.537 --> 10:24.205
to forget my order one last time.

10:30.379 --> 10:32.881
Do you think quitting
my job was a mistake?

10:33.883 --> 10:35.884
Do you see me drinking lemonade?

10:37.011 --> 10:38.386
No. I'm serious.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.722
Why do you ask?

10:40.890 --> 10:43.433
Because Leonard just pissed me off.

10:43.601 --> 10:45.060
Am I being an idiot or not?

10:45.227 --> 10:47.520
No, I don't think you are.

10:47.688 --> 10:49.064
Really?

10:49.565 --> 10:52.525
The best way to achieve
a goal is to devote 100 percent

10:52.693 --> 10:54.653
of your time and energy to it.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.321
When I decided I was
going to be a physicist,

10:56.489 --> 10:59.741
I didn't take some other job
in case it didn't work out.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.989
Which wasn't easy because
there was a lot of pressure

11:02.078 --> 11:04.954
from Ms. Pierson for me
to be chalk monitor that year.

11:07.249 --> 11:09.084
Thank you.
I needed to hear that.

11:09.251 --> 11:11.086
Why can't Leonard understand it?

11:12.296 --> 11:14.839
Because he's not like us, Penny.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.634
We're dreamers.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.597
Yeah, I need to start cracking the
window when I leave you in the car.

11:29.980 --> 11:30.980
Hey.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.440
Hello, Bert.

11:32.608 --> 11:35.402
So, anyway, there's this big
rock and mineral show

11:35.569 --> 11:37.320
next week in Santa Monica and...

11:37.488 --> 11:41.116
Listen... Bert, before you
say anything else, I...

11:41.867 --> 11:43.410
I have a boyfriend.

11:43.619 --> 11:46.454
Oh. This is awkward.

11:46.622 --> 11:49.541
You thought I was gonna ask you
to go with me to the mineral show.

11:49.709 --> 11:50.875
Weren't you?

11:52.002 --> 11:53.628
Yeah.

11:56.090 --> 11:59.968
That's very nice of you,
but I do have a boyfriend.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.553
That's what you all say.

12:01.721 --> 12:02.721
You just don't want
to go out with me

12:02.888 --> 12:04.889
because I have
an off-putting personality.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.641
No, that's not true.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.810
My boyfriend has
an off-putting personality, too.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.187
Way worse than you.

12:13.315 --> 12:15.483
Don't worry. I'm used to it.

12:15.651 --> 12:18.570
I mean, I'm big and weird
and funny-looking

12:18.738 --> 12:21.448
and no one ever wants
to do anything with me.

12:22.032 --> 12:23.825
Don't say that.

12:24.243 --> 12:27.203
It's okay.
I know I'm a monster.

12:27.371 --> 12:29.664
No, Bert, come on.

12:30.624 --> 12:32.344
I'd love to go to the
mineral show with you.

12:32.501 --> 12:35.170
Sweet. It's a date.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.842
- No, it's not.
- Too late!

12:48.851 --> 12:51.060
Wow.

12:52.688 --> 12:55.064
Yeah. Haven't seen this
many people in my store

12:55.232 --> 12:58.693
since that Korean church bus
crashed through my front window.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.405
- Hey! Stuart!
- Jesse.

13:02.573 --> 13:05.700
Haven't seen you in forever.
Look how gray you've gotten.

13:05.868 --> 13:08.203
My hair's exactly
the same color as always.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.455
No, I was talking about your skin.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.958
Look... my friend here
needs a comic book...

13:14.168 --> 13:16.377
Ooh! And she went into
your store by mistake.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.130
Good thing there was no
one there to see you.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.174
What do you need?

13:21.842 --> 13:24.803
Oh, yeah, yeah. I got this.
Right over here.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.057
Even you, Sweatpants?

13:29.225 --> 13:30.975
Free popcorn.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.312
Can I offer you a coffee?

13:34.480 --> 13:36.815
- Espresso? Latte?
- No, thanks.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.775
How about you, Stu?
Mocha? Scone?

13:38.943 --> 13:41.236
Directions to the
nearest soup kitchen?

13:42.446 --> 13:43.905
- Hey.
- I'm just kidding.

13:44.073 --> 13:46.241
He knows where the soup kitchen is.

13:48.744 --> 13:50.286
It's on Merton Avenue.

13:51.872 --> 13:54.165
I don't think I like the way
you're treating my friend.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.792
Sorry.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.169
- You want the book or not?
- Not from you.

13:58.879 --> 14:00.421
Let's go, Stuart.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.593
You know something, Jesse?

14:05.761 --> 14:07.595
You may have a
successful business

14:07.763 --> 14:11.099
and the kind of pink complexion
that comes with good nutrition...

14:12.601 --> 14:14.602
but I have something
more important.

14:14.770 --> 14:18.022
- What's that?
- Friendship.

14:21.277 --> 14:24.070
Which I would trade in a
heartbeat for all of this.

14:27.449 --> 14:29.450
The mineral and rock show?

14:29.618 --> 14:32.328
That would be awful even
without Bert.

14:33.455 --> 14:35.456
So what am I supposed to do now?

14:35.624 --> 14:38.877
Prepare your uterus
for his gigantic offspring?

14:41.130 --> 14:42.797
This isn't funny.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.405
I'm gonna have to
tell him the truth:

14:44.425 --> 14:45.945
that even if I didn't
have a boyfriend,

14:45.968 --> 14:47.468
I wouldn't be interested in him.

14:47.636 --> 14:49.637
I've heard those
words so many times.

14:49.805 --> 14:51.931
From Linda Nosenchuck,
Tammy Rosenworcel...

14:52.099 --> 14:53.474
Padma Kapur, Neha Chowdury...

14:53.642 --> 14:55.476
Marci Grossman,
Lisa Mazzarino...

14:55.644 --> 14:57.145
- Megan Pincus...
- Tammy Cho...

14:57.313 --> 14:58.753
Who was that girl
from our Starbucks?

14:58.814 --> 15:01.024
- Arlene Russell!
- Yes! Arlene!

15:02.026 --> 15:05.194
She wrote "no way"
on both our cappuccinos.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.156
Poor Bert.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.491
That guy's got a rough
afternoon ahead of him.

15:10.659 --> 15:14.287
Well, how would you want a girl
to tell you she wasn't interested?

15:14.455 --> 15:19.459
I guess, uh, I'd like her to sit me
down, look me in the eye and say,

15:19.627 --> 15:22.128
"I was wrong. I love you."

15:22.296 --> 15:25.548
And then maybe she could
touch me in a special way.

15:27.301 --> 15:29.344
That's how you reject a guy.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.220
Okay, I don't have time for this.

15:31.388 --> 15:33.848
I'm just gonna go find him
and be brutally honest.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.350
- No, don't.
- He'll be so upset.

15:35.517 --> 15:37.437
He'll probably climb
up the Empire State Building

15:37.478 --> 15:39.520
and start swatting at planes.

15:44.401 --> 15:45.777
You want us to talk to him?

15:45.945 --> 15:47.987
Really? You would do that?

15:48.155 --> 15:49.864
Sure. We've both been in his shoes.

15:50.032 --> 15:52.367
We'll let him down with
compassion and respect.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.495
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.040
So we tell him
she's a lesbian, right?

15:59.208 --> 16:01.209
Of course we tell him
she's a lesbian.

16:09.593 --> 16:11.928
And hold three...

16:12.096 --> 16:14.514
two... one.

16:14.682 --> 16:15.682
Very good.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.435
Now let's try Warrior II.

16:20.854 --> 16:22.438
And hold.

16:25.734 --> 16:29.070
I've read that there are great
yogis who have such mastery

16:29.238 --> 16:33.157
over their bodies they can draw
water in through their genitals.

16:41.792 --> 16:44.585
Yeah, well, I don't think we're
gonna get to do that today.

16:46.213 --> 16:47.714
Too bad.

16:47.881 --> 16:49.716
It seems like a good way
to drink a milk shake

16:49.883 --> 16:51.926
without getting brain freeze.

16:54.513 --> 16:55.930
Oh, hey.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.765
And now we go to Reverse Warrior.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.273
How did she get you to do yoga?

17:05.858 --> 17:09.193
Well, to be honest,
I thought she said "Yoda."

17:12.448 --> 17:16.367
I'm helping him relax because,
unlike you, he supports me.

17:16.660 --> 17:18.953
Oh, How many times
do I have to say it?

17:19.121 --> 17:21.456
- I support you.
- Sheldon, take a break.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.667
Namaste.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.713
Okay, if you support me,
what was with that phone call?

17:28.881 --> 17:31.507
Fine. I'm not sure
you should have quit.

17:31.675 --> 17:33.134
But if you care so
much what I think,

17:33.302 --> 17:34.863
why didn't you ask me
before you did it?

17:34.928 --> 17:36.262
Oh, so now I need
your permission?

17:36.430 --> 17:38.350
Would you have asked me
before you quit your job?

17:38.474 --> 17:40.975
Yes. I thought we were
in the kind of relationship

17:41.143 --> 17:42.810
where we make decisions together.

17:42.978 --> 17:44.353
If I'm wrong,
then maybe we need to talk

17:44.521 --> 17:46.147
about the kind of relationship
we're actually in.

17:46.315 --> 17:47.648
Yeah, well, maybe we do.

17:47.816 --> 17:49.650
I'm willing to if you guys are.

17:51.737 --> 17:52.977
Can we please have some privacy?

17:52.988 --> 17:54.322
No.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.490
I'm as much a part of this
relationship as you two,

17:56.492 --> 17:59.118
and I think it's high time we
put all our cards on the table.

17:59.286 --> 18:01.412
Yeah. For example,
where is this going?

18:01.580 --> 18:03.414
Are you two ever getting married?

18:03.582 --> 18:07.126
And, if so, where will we all live?
Have you thought about that?

18:08.670 --> 18:10.004
- No.
- Penny?

18:10.172 --> 18:11.506
OK, wait. What are we doing?

18:11.673 --> 18:13.341
For some reason,
we're planning a future

18:13.509 --> 18:15.635
where we both live
with Sheldon forever.

18:15.803 --> 18:17.762
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.

18:19.389 --> 18:21.724
Look, I know you think I'm being
reckless, and you might be right,

18:21.892 --> 18:23.309
but I need to take this shot.

18:23.477 --> 18:27.522
No kidding. Despite what it says
on her rГ©sumГ©, she is no longer 22.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.945
I swear, I am on your side.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.989
You keep saying you're on my
side, but you don't act like it.

18:37.157 --> 18:39.534
He does that to me, too.
Why do we put up with it?

18:41.703 --> 18:44.914
Listen, I could never do
what you're doing, okay?

18:45.082 --> 18:47.625
- I would be terrified.
- Well, it's scary for me, too.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.627
I'm fine with it.

18:50.921 --> 18:55.049
My point is, just because I couldn't
do it doesn't mean you shouldn't.

18:55.217 --> 18:57.635
And I'm proud of you.

18:59.596 --> 19:02.223
Okay. Thank you.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.559
Well, to celebrate
this reconciliation,

19:04.726 --> 19:06.269
let's all share a milk shake.

19:06.436 --> 19:08.980
Penny, you'll need a straw.

19:15.404 --> 19:16.904
- You're back.
- Yes, I am!

19:17.072 --> 19:18.531
There's a few more things
I want to say to you.

19:18.699 --> 19:21.701
Stuart's store is just fine, and he's
a much nicer person than you are,

19:21.869 --> 19:24.453
and if you still have that comic,
I'd like to buy it right now!

19:25.873 --> 19:27.039
No problem.

19:27.207 --> 19:29.584
Oh, you want a latte
while you wait?

19:29.751 --> 19:31.586
No, I don't want a latte!

19:31.753 --> 19:34.505
I want a cappuccino
and a blueberry scone!

19:35.257 --> 19:39.010
- I only have chocolate chip.
- Well, that sounds even better!

19:45.267 --> 19:48.186
Thanks for coming to the
mineral and rock show with me.

19:52.232 --> 19:54.775
We're sorry Amy didn't want to go.

19:54.943 --> 19:57.737
Really, really sorry.

19:58.906 --> 20:01.741
Nah, who needs her
when I have you guys?

20:01.909 --> 20:05.453
Rock show!
Rock show! Rock show!

20:05.913 --> 20:07.747
Rock show! Rock show!

20:07.915 --> 20:12.585
Rock show!
Rock show!
