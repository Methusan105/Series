WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:04.169
Previously on
The Big Bang Theory...

00:04.462 --> 00:05.921
Sheldon, did you just figure out

00:06.089 --> 00:09.299
a method for synthesizing
a new stable super-heavy element?

00:09.467 --> 00:11.010
Did I?

00:11.177 --> 00:12.261
Well, that can't be right.

00:12.429 --> 00:13.971
No one's ever done that before.

00:14.139 --> 00:15.764
Except me because I just did it!

00:15.932 --> 00:17.599
в™Є Sheldon and his brain, yeah в™Є

00:17.767 --> 00:19.643
в™Є Sheldon and his brain, yeah! в™Є

00:19.811 --> 00:22.021
I've made a horrible mistake.

00:22.249 --> 00:23.249
What are you talking about?

00:23.273 --> 00:25.858
This table,
it's in square centimeters.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.901
I read it as square meters.

00:28.069 --> 00:29.319
You know what that means?

00:29.487 --> 00:31.697
That Americans can't handle
the metric system?

00:33.950 --> 00:37.369
Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.788
But the Chinese team
found the element.

00:39.956 --> 00:41.123
Yeah, well, they shouldn't have.

00:41.207 --> 00:42.708
My calculations were wrong.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.677
The greatest scientific
achievement of my life

00:44.836 --> 00:46.420
is based on a blunder.

00:46.588 --> 00:47.713
I'm not a genius.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.048
I'm a fraud.

00:49.924 --> 00:51.324
You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience,

00:51.384 --> 00:53.927
we're forever finding something
in one part of the brain

00:54.095 --> 00:55.456
that we thought was
someplace else.

00:55.555 --> 00:58.098
Oh, great,
now I'm worse than a fraud.

00:58.808 --> 01:00.434
I'm practically a biologist.

01:03.229 --> 01:05.355
This is Science Friday.
I'm Ira Flatow.

01:05.523 --> 01:08.692
My guest today is responsible
for the discovery of the first

01:08.860 --> 01:11.320
stable super-heavy element.

01:11.488 --> 01:12.821
Welcome, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

01:12.989 --> 01:13.989
Thank you.

01:15.325 --> 01:16.366
The university made me come here.

01:16.534 --> 01:17.534
I didn't want to.

01:19.537 --> 01:21.497
Big fan of the show.

01:22.624 --> 01:25.042
So, I understand
that you actually discovered

01:25.126 --> 01:26.543
this element by mistake.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.464
Yes.

01:31.007 --> 01:33.509
And some people in the science
community are calling it

01:33.676 --> 01:35.511
"The Wonder Blunder."

01:35.678 --> 01:37.179
Who?
Give me their names.

01:37.347 --> 01:38.764
I bet it's Wolowitz.

01:39.724 --> 01:41.433
It's just such a fascinating story.

01:41.601 --> 01:42.976
Your calculations are way off,

01:43.144 --> 01:45.354
but they find the element anyway.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.689
It's like misreading
a treasure map

01:47.857 --> 01:50.067
and still finding the treasure.

01:50.235 --> 01:52.069
Can we talk
about something else?

01:52.237 --> 01:54.488
Do you know that I yodel?

01:57.200 --> 01:58.784
That's interesting,
but this could be taking you

01:58.910 --> 02:01.161
down the path
toward a Nobel Prize.

02:01.329 --> 02:02.538
And in Chemistry, no less.

02:02.705 --> 02:04.706
And wouldn't that be unusual?

02:04.874 --> 02:07.042
Because you're a physicist.

02:07.210 --> 02:09.371
Yes, yes, I'd be a physicist
with a Nobel in Chemistry.

02:09.504 --> 02:11.338
Everyone laugh at the circus freak.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.342
I don't need to sit
here and take this, Flatow.

02:16.177 --> 02:17.719
It is because of bullies like you,

02:17.887 --> 02:19.388
every day more and more Americans

02:19.556 --> 02:21.557
are making the switch to television.

02:48.376 --> 02:50.836
President Seibert, I don't
know why you're yelling.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.213
You're the one who
made me go on the radio.

02:53.381 --> 02:56.049
I was expecting a professional
science interview,

02:56.217 --> 02:59.553
not an attack by some
morning zoo shock jock.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.274
Well, if the university
needs money so badly,

03:03.433 --> 03:05.475
perhaps you should
start a swear jar.

03:07.228 --> 03:09.438
Whoa! That one's worth a dollar.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.108
I know you don't like it,

03:13.276 --> 03:14.443
but every time
you do an interview,

03:14.611 --> 03:16.445
it raises the profile
of the university.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.113
That translates to funding.

03:18.281 --> 03:19.281
Yeah, well, I'm not just

03:19.282 --> 03:21.450
some trained monkey
dancing for coins.

03:23.119 --> 03:24.119
Of course you're not.

03:24.245 --> 03:25.704
People love trained monkeys.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.374
How can you not be happy?

03:29.542 --> 03:31.084
You're tall, thin and famous.

03:31.252 --> 03:33.212
Oh, my God,
I'm jealous of Sheldon.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.049
Look, you're going to be
doing this stuff for a while.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.498
You're just going to have to find
a way to get used to it.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.303
But none of you know
what this is like.

03:41.471 --> 03:44.473
Being celebrated for something
you wish you never did.

03:44.641 --> 03:47.142
You clearly haven't been with me
at Mardi Gras.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.357
Want to pause the video game
and help me clean up?

03:53.524 --> 03:54.524
I am cleaning up.

03:54.692 --> 03:56.944
Look at the mess the Joker
made of Gotham City.

03:58.321 --> 04:00.989
Come on, it's your friend
who's coming to stay here.

04:01.157 --> 04:02.407
Raj grew up in India.

04:02.575 --> 04:03.867
Trust me, he's seen worse.

04:05.578 --> 04:06.578
Howie.

04:06.704 --> 04:08.789
I promise I'll help out
the rest of the week.

04:08.957 --> 04:09.957
The rest of the week?

04:10.083 --> 04:11.708
You said it was just
going to be a night or two.

04:11.876 --> 04:13.669
Yeah, but if I told you a week,
would you have said yes?

04:13.836 --> 04:16.213
- No!
- Then you left me no choice.

04:17.632 --> 04:20.926
I love Raj, but that's
a long time for a house guest.

04:21.302 --> 04:22.903
I know,
but they're tenting his building.

04:22.971 --> 04:25.180
He can't find a hotel
he likes that allows dogs.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.766
- He's bringing Cinnamon?
- For a whole week!

04:27.934 --> 04:29.184
The nerve of some people.

04:32.855 --> 04:36.400
Here comes
the Embarrassment Express.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.695
With stops at Fraudville...

04:39.862 --> 04:41.863
...WonderBlunderberg...

04:42.365 --> 04:45.200
...and Kansas City.

04:45.368 --> 04:46.535
Because it's a hub.

04:48.913 --> 04:50.414
Sheldon, can I come in?

04:50.581 --> 04:51.707
- Do you have cookies?
- No.

04:51.874 --> 04:53.458
Good. I don't deserve cookies.
Come in.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.462
Wil?

04:57.463 --> 04:58.839
Hey, Sheldon.
It's been a while.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.215
Why are you here?

05:00.383 --> 05:01.883
Amy said you were
having a rough time,

05:02.051 --> 05:03.093
and I thought maybe we could talk.

05:03.261 --> 05:04.553
Is that okay?

05:04.804 --> 05:06.430
Certainly.

05:06.597 --> 05:08.398
Although... right now,
I'm having a rough time

05:08.474 --> 05:10.726
because there's
three people in my room,

05:10.893 --> 05:12.653
and it's starting to feel
like a discotheque.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.356
Sheldon, you said you were
unhappy getting attention

05:16.524 --> 05:18.608
for something you wished
you never did.

05:18.776 --> 05:20.456
Yeah, I know a little
something about that.

05:20.611 --> 05:22.529
Oh, nonsense, Wil.

05:22.697 --> 05:25.574
Your endless tweets
are not that bad.

05:27.368 --> 05:28.689
I remember why it's been a while.

05:30.079 --> 05:31.121
Sheldon, I was actually talking

05:31.289 --> 05:32.729
about when I was a kid on Star Trek.

05:33.791 --> 05:35.167
How could you not
like getting attention

05:35.335 --> 05:36.668
for playing Wesley Crusher?

05:36.836 --> 05:38.754
You were wonderful.

05:38.921 --> 05:42.341
A know-it-all boy genius
with an eidetic memory.

05:42.508 --> 05:44.259
Who couldn't relate to that?

05:45.428 --> 05:47.054
Well, not everybody felt that way.

05:47.221 --> 05:48.901
A lot of people
really hated the character,

05:48.931 --> 05:51.058
and some of them
hated me because of it.

05:51.225 --> 05:52.017
I would do interviews,

05:52.185 --> 05:53.685
and people would be mean to me.

05:53.978 --> 05:55.937
That just happened to me.

05:56.105 --> 05:57.731
Next time you're stuck for a tweet,

05:57.899 --> 06:00.567
feel free to say
what a jerk Ira Flatow is.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.112
Sheldon, the point is
Wil learned to embrace

06:04.280 --> 06:07.407
that part of his life and
moved on to bigger and better things.

06:07.575 --> 06:08.909
Yeah, I'm an author now,

06:09.077 --> 06:10.452
I do public speaking,

06:10.620 --> 06:12.788
and I have my own web series
about board games.

06:14.165 --> 06:16.041
We're trying to cheer him up, so...

06:21.589 --> 06:22.839
I'm just saying
that there was a time

06:23.007 --> 06:25.527
when I thought I would never get
out of Wesley Crusher's shadow.

06:26.010 --> 06:29.137
But now, it's just one small part
of a pretty great life,

06:29.305 --> 06:31.264
and it's a part
that I'm happy is there.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.600
I do see what you're saying.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.102
That helps.

06:35.269 --> 06:36.269
Good.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.480
Would you two like to stay
and play trains with me?

06:38.648 --> 06:39.648
- Sure.
- Okay.

06:39.732 --> 06:40.732
Oh, great!

06:41.859 --> 06:44.986
Now... I work the controls.

06:45.154 --> 06:46.154
I say "All aboard."

06:46.322 --> 06:47.989
You sit quietly and watch.

06:49.951 --> 06:51.410
Can I blow the whistle?

06:53.538 --> 06:54.788
You should probably go.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.348
You're going to brush
your teeth on my couch?

07:04.465 --> 07:06.550
No, I'm going to brush
Cinnamon's teeth.

07:07.635 --> 07:08.635
Why bother?

07:08.719 --> 07:11.054
She spends half the time
licking her butt.

07:12.348 --> 07:13.709
And the other half
licking my face.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.517
That's why I'm brushing her teeth.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.521
Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm so late.

07:19.689 --> 07:22.107
- Did you already have dinner?
- No, we were waiting for you.

07:22.316 --> 07:23.400
That's so sweet.

07:23.568 --> 07:25.819
Yeah. So what do you
feel like making?

07:27.363 --> 07:29.406
Howard, the poor thing
just got home from work.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.533
Let me get you a glass of wine.

07:31.701 --> 07:33.076
I'll cook dinner.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.045
- Oh, Raj, you're our guest.
- Don't be silly.

07:35.204 --> 07:37.038
Sit.
You look like you've had a long day.

07:37.206 --> 07:39.791
No, she always looks like that.

07:42.628 --> 07:44.880
Because she married an idiot.

07:47.717 --> 07:48.717
Thank you, Raj.

07:48.885 --> 07:51.428
Please, this is my way
of thanking you

07:51.596 --> 07:53.263
for letting me stay here.

07:53.431 --> 07:56.224
Now, tell us all about your day.

07:56.392 --> 07:58.226
Okay, well, first,

07:58.394 --> 08:00.228
I was late to a meeting
because I was stuck in traffic.

08:00.396 --> 08:02.272
I keep telling you to put
that traffic app on your phone.

08:02.356 --> 08:05.108
Hey, when you got home today
complaining that you felt sick

08:05.276 --> 08:07.569
from eating too many jelly beans,
did I tell you how to fix it?

08:07.737 --> 08:08.737
No.

08:10.656 --> 08:13.617
I said, "Aw, that must hurt,"
and I rubbed your belly.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.706
I thought of you the whole time.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.128
All I'm saying is
there's a time to just listen.

08:25.296 --> 08:26.463
Thank you.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.632
There's also a time to stop
eating too many jelly beans.

08:28.799 --> 08:30.383
And it's when you're ten.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.222
Hello, President Siebert.

08:35.389 --> 08:36.765
Thank you for taking my call.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.559
I just wanted you to know
that you can now expect

08:39.727 --> 08:43.396
enthusiastic participation
from me regarding my discovery.

08:43.564 --> 08:44.648
No, no, no, no.

08:44.815 --> 08:45.982
No need to thank me.

08:46.150 --> 08:48.485
Thank my friend, Wil Wheaton.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.446
For your information,
I have nine friends.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.242
Ten if we include you.

08:56.577 --> 08:58.119
Nine it is.

09:01.874 --> 09:04.543
Eh, it's ten.
I'll count Wolowitz.

09:06.087 --> 09:09.047
- Hello, friend Leonard.
- Hey, you're in a good mood.

09:09.215 --> 09:10.507
I'm in a great mood.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.676
Well, you're about to be
in an even better one.

09:12.843 --> 09:15.163
I didn't want to say anything
until I knew for sure, but...

09:15.304 --> 09:17.847
I've been re-running the tests
on your element in my lab

09:18.015 --> 09:19.808
and I disproved it.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.351
Your element does not exist!

09:22.436 --> 09:24.563
Yeah, but what about
the Chinese research team?

09:24.689 --> 09:25.689
They found it.

09:25.731 --> 09:29.317
Yeah, it turns out someone added
simulated signals to the data files.

09:29.485 --> 09:30.902
They faked the results.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.070
Really?

09:32.238 --> 09:33.905
Yes!
Do you know what that means?

09:34.073 --> 09:36.908
It means that all of this
attention that you hate goes away.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.952
- So no more interviews?
- No, it's all over.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.912
- I can't believe it.
- Well, you're welcome.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.290
You robbed me
of my greatest achievement!

09:45.436 --> 09:46.436
What?!

09:46.460 --> 09:48.044
I'm back down to nine friends!

09:49.255 --> 09:51.339
Make it eight.
I'm sick of Wolowitz, too!

09:52.675 --> 09:55.010
I don't understand.

09:55.177 --> 09:58.054
All you've done since you discovered
this stupid element was complain.

09:58.222 --> 09:59.462
I was trying to make you happy!

09:59.557 --> 10:02.017
By taking away
my only claim to fame?

10:02.184 --> 10:03.685
Well, if you wanted
to make me happy,

10:03.853 --> 10:05.103
you could have told me a joke.

10:05.271 --> 10:08.440
Or shown me a cute video
of a koala and an otter

10:08.608 --> 10:09.941
becoming unlikely friends.

10:11.068 --> 10:13.361
There is no winning with you.

10:13.529 --> 10:15.739
And koalas and otters
don't even live near each other!

10:15.865 --> 10:18.158
That's what makes
their friendship unlikely!

10:18.868 --> 10:21.244
Hey!
What's with all the yelling?

10:21.829 --> 10:23.204
Leonard disproved my element.

10:23.372 --> 10:26.082
Now all the attention
is going to go away.

10:26.250 --> 10:27.584
Oh, that's great.
You must be thrilled!

10:27.752 --> 10:30.211
That's it!
I'm down to seven friends.

10:32.173 --> 10:34.507
He's counting Hobbits
and superheroes, right?

10:34.884 --> 10:37.969
When I thought the element was real,
I didn't want it.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.804
But now that Leonard
made it not exist,

10:39.972 --> 10:41.640
I want it more
than anything in the world.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.892
The element never existed.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.780
I didn't take it away,
science took it away.

10:45.853 --> 10:46.853
Be mad at science.

10:46.937 --> 10:48.980
Don't you dare use
science against me.

10:49.940 --> 10:52.067
Science is my best friend!

10:52.234 --> 10:53.943
Oh, good, I'm back up to eight.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.405
Will you tell him
he's out of his mind.

10:57.573 --> 10:58.573
Actually, I get what he's saying.

10:58.741 --> 10:59.741
Yes! Nine!

10:59.784 --> 11:01.242
Welcome back, buddy.

11:03.537 --> 11:05.413
It's like if you're dating
someone you're not that into,

11:05.581 --> 11:06.821
and then they break up with you

11:06.832 --> 11:08.083
and then you want them
more than ever.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.811
I have no idea what
she's talking about.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.420
But we're ganging up on you
so I agree.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.924
Okay, Sheldon, what do you
want me to do,

11:16.092 --> 11:17.258
hide the information?

11:17.426 --> 11:18.968
If I don't publish it,
it's just a matter of time

11:19.136 --> 11:20.136
before someone else does.

11:20.304 --> 11:21.930
No, no, of course
you have to publish.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.848
That's your responsibility
as a scientist.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.517
Doing otherwise
would be unethical.

11:25.685 --> 11:26.768
You have no choice.

11:27.478 --> 11:28.561
Fine, I'll publish.

11:28.729 --> 11:30.021
Can you believe this guy?

11:36.529 --> 11:38.363
Oh, Raj did the dishes.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.948
How do you know
I didn't do them?

11:40.116 --> 11:41.658
Because once,
when all the knives were dirty,

11:41.826 --> 11:43.618
you cut a bagel with your keys.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.789
Good morning, everybody.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.916
I picked up coffee
while I was out.

11:50.084 --> 11:52.502
Bernadette,
here's your soy peppermint mocha.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.671
You didn't have to do that.

11:54.839 --> 11:55.797
Oh, my pleasure, and don't worry

11:55.965 --> 11:56.923
about your presentation today.

11:57.091 --> 11:58.133
You're going to be great.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.301
Yeah, you're going to
knock it out of the park.

12:00.469 --> 12:02.429
What presentation do I have today?

12:04.140 --> 12:05.390
Just go.

12:09.478 --> 12:10.812
He loves you.

12:11.272 --> 12:12.272
What are you doing?

12:12.356 --> 12:13.523
Are you trying
to make me look bad?

12:13.691 --> 12:15.066
I'm just being
a good house guest.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.526
No, you're being
a better husband than I am.

12:16.694 --> 12:18.278
Doing the dishes,
getting coffee,

12:18.446 --> 12:19.487
knowing about her life?

12:19.655 --> 12:20.905
Who does that?

12:22.366 --> 12:24.033
Oh, come on,
I brought you one, too.

12:24.201 --> 12:25.702
I don't want coffee.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.231
That's why I got you
hot chocolate.

12:27.329 --> 12:29.289
Give me that.

12:29.457 --> 12:32.000
Just stop showing me up.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.501
Howard, listen to me.

12:33.669 --> 12:34.919
You're a great husband.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.505
Yes, your listening skills
could use some work.

12:37.673 --> 12:40.133
But it's amazing
how far you've come

12:40.259 --> 12:44.179
given that you're an only child
raised by an over-protective mom.

12:45.389 --> 12:46.848
Is this getting weird?

12:47.016 --> 12:48.016
Hang on.

12:52.521 --> 12:54.189
Oh, yes.

12:56.358 --> 12:58.443
Hey.

12:58.694 --> 13:00.904
I just wanted to let you know
that I posted my findings.

13:01.071 --> 13:02.155
I saw.

13:02.323 --> 13:05.575
And I just posted
a retraction of my paper.

13:05.743 --> 13:08.578
Now the whole scientific community
knows I was wrong.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.247
These things happen
all the time, Sheldon.

13:11.415 --> 13:12.415
Not to me.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.542
The only other retraction
I ever had to issue

13:14.710 --> 13:17.212
was when I was seven
and I conceded that my brother

13:17.379 --> 13:19.714
was the greatest ninja
in East Texas.

13:21.342 --> 13:23.968
But that was just a ploy
to get my face out of his armpit.

13:25.429 --> 13:27.222
There he is!

13:28.390 --> 13:29.808
It's my favorite superhero,

13:29.975 --> 13:31.893
the Retractor!

13:33.896 --> 13:36.397
Come on,
don't give him a hard time.

13:36.565 --> 13:37.690
I'm sorry, Cooper.

13:37.858 --> 13:39.400
I retract it.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.654
By the way, Hofstadter,

13:42.822 --> 13:45.198
nice job disproving
the Chinese team.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.366
It's not a big deal.

13:46.450 --> 13:47.909
It's a huge deal.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.703
Cooper, maybe physics
just isn't your thing.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.748
Have you ever considered
a career in retail?

13:53.916 --> 13:56.709
That way you could take
things back for a living.

13:58.337 --> 13:59.546
Okay, Barry, that's enough.

13:59.713 --> 14:00.922
Oh, no, that's okay.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.924
I can fight my own battles.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.760
Isn't that right, "Bawwy"?

14:08.305 --> 14:09.472
Is...?

14:09.640 --> 14:12.225
Is that a reference
to my speech impediment?

14:13.686 --> 14:16.104
That's pretty hurtful.

14:16.272 --> 14:17.522
I...

14:17.690 --> 14:19.691
I can't control it.

14:21.151 --> 14:22.151
You're right,

14:22.236 --> 14:24.112
that was uncalled for.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.530
I take it back.

14:25.698 --> 14:26.489
Of course you do.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.658
Because you're the Retractor!

14:33.038 --> 14:35.039
Raj, this dinner was amazing.

14:35.207 --> 14:36.288
If you're here much longer,

14:36.333 --> 14:38.167
I'm going to have
to buy bigger clothes.

14:38.335 --> 14:39.335
Nonsense.

14:39.336 --> 14:40.336
You need a little fattening up.

14:40.504 --> 14:42.213
You've been looking
too skinny lately.

14:42.423 --> 14:43.715
Aww.

14:43.841 --> 14:46.217
Howie, how come you never
say anything sweet like that?

14:46.385 --> 14:47.176
What are you talking about?

14:47.344 --> 14:48.428
Remember last week,
when I asked you

14:48.596 --> 14:49.804
if you were wearing Spanx
and you weren't?

14:49.972 --> 14:51.681
How's that different?

14:53.767 --> 14:55.101
Maybe you could try being
more thoughtful,

14:55.269 --> 14:56.686
like your friend Raj.

14:56.854 --> 14:59.230
Yeah, well, maybe you could
try being more like Raj.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.232
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, yeah.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.721
He packed me
a lunch this morning.

15:02.818 --> 15:05.862
And there was a note inside
that said, "Go get them."

15:06.864 --> 15:08.448
Like I don't do enough around here.

15:08.616 --> 15:09.816
Now I need to pack your lunch?

15:09.909 --> 15:11.409
And by the way, why do you need
a note telling you

15:11.577 --> 15:12.702
to go get them?
You're a grown man!

15:12.828 --> 15:14.149
You should know to "go get them!"

15:15.247 --> 15:16.497
I do know to "go get them,"

15:16.665 --> 15:18.249
but sometimes
it's nice to have emotional support

15:18.334 --> 15:20.335
when I'm going and getting them!

15:20.377 --> 15:23.004
Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves?

15:23.172 --> 15:26.341
Let's just, you know, all calm down
and take a step back.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.636
This is stupid.
Why are we fighting?

15:29.803 --> 15:30.803
I don't know.

15:30.846 --> 15:33.973
I guess I was just feeling
like I'm a lousy husband.

15:34.141 --> 15:35.475
You're not a lousy husband.

15:35.643 --> 15:36.768
You're a great husband.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.020
I was the one feeling
like a lousy wife.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.272
Are you kidding?
You're the best.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.815
I know what the problem is.

15:42.983 --> 15:44.192
It's him!

15:45.486 --> 15:47.445
Oh, what did I do?

15:47.613 --> 15:49.405
You made us feel like
we're not trying hard enough.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.573
Yeah, we were totally fine
half-assing our marriage

15:51.659 --> 15:53.368
till you showed up.

15:53.535 --> 15:56.079
Look, I'm sorry
you're upset with me,

15:56.246 --> 15:57.789
but I just have to say
it's nice to see

15:57.957 --> 15:59.332
the two of you on the same page.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.000
Oh, it does feel good

16:01.168 --> 16:02.585
to have you backing me up for once.

16:02.753 --> 16:04.921
- I back you up all the time!
- That is not...

16:05.089 --> 16:07.009
- He's doing it again!
- What is wrong with you?!

16:09.051 --> 16:10.551
I can't believe they kicked you out.

16:10.719 --> 16:12.553
I can't believe
they're still married.

16:14.390 --> 16:17.725
Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon's
toothbrush at Howard's.

16:17.893 --> 16:20.144
I guess you're sharing
with Daddy again.

16:25.693 --> 16:28.069
Bark once if you need me
to call PETA.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.491
What's that animal doing
in our apartment?

16:33.659 --> 16:35.785
Oh, relax, she's in her crate.
She can't get out.

16:35.953 --> 16:37.495
I have two words for you:

16:37.663 --> 16:39.539
Jurassic Park.

16:40.249 --> 16:42.750
This day just keeps
getting worse and worse.

16:42.918 --> 16:44.293
You know, if it makes
you feel any better...

16:44.461 --> 16:46.421
- It probably won't.
- You're probably right.

16:47.756 --> 16:49.424
Sheldon, it's a beautiful night.

16:49.591 --> 16:52.093
Why don't you and I
go for a nice walk together?

16:52.261 --> 16:54.762
Oh, everything is just
sex with you isn't it?

16:56.265 --> 16:58.725
Sheldon, I think
you might find the support

16:58.892 --> 17:00.268
you're looking for, if you realize

17:00.436 --> 17:02.520
that relationships
are a give and take.

17:02.688 --> 17:03.938
She can only be there for you

17:04.106 --> 17:05.857
as much as you are for her.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.650
Thank you, Rajesh.

17:07.818 --> 17:09.944
And, Amy, you need
to be patient with Sheldon,

17:10.112 --> 17:13.114
instead of pressuring him
to accept intimacy on your terms.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.534
You should probably go.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.667
I'm Ira Flatow,
and this is Science Friday.

17:24.835 --> 17:26.794
I'd like to welcome back
Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

17:26.962 --> 17:28.880
who thought he had discovered

17:29.048 --> 17:31.632
a new super-heavy element
only to have it disproved

17:31.800 --> 17:34.093
by my next guest,
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

17:34.261 --> 17:35.386
Welcome to Science Friday,
gentlemen.

17:35.512 --> 17:36.679
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

17:36.847 --> 17:41.350
Ira, if I may, I'd like to apologize
for my behavior last week.

17:41.518 --> 17:42.935
It's all right.

17:43.103 --> 17:46.481
Now, isn't there something
you'd like to say to me?

17:48.400 --> 17:49.484
No.

17:50.486 --> 17:51.819
Now, Dr. Hofstadter.

17:51.987 --> 17:53.154
Can you walk us
through the process

17:53.322 --> 17:55.031
you used to disprove his theory?

17:55.199 --> 17:57.784
- Well...
- I believe I can answer that.

17:57.951 --> 17:59.702
He asked me.

17:59.870 --> 18:00.953
Fine.

18:01.121 --> 18:02.121
As I was saying...

18:02.164 --> 18:03.456
You're telling it wrong.
Ira...

18:04.083 --> 18:05.458
...to really understand the story here,

18:05.626 --> 18:07.187
you have to start
at the very beginning.

18:07.211 --> 18:10.088
A small town in East Texas,
where a young genius named...

18:10.255 --> 18:11.975
- Sheldon...
- That's right, Sheldon Cooper.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.218
He was bitten by his neighbor's dog,

18:15.385 --> 18:17.145
leading to his first
scientific breakthrough,

18:17.304 --> 18:19.388
the doggie death-ray.

18:19.556 --> 18:21.766
Which, sadly, he couldn't build

18:21.934 --> 18:24.644
because Santa wouldn't bring
him enriched uranium.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.396
You know, I'd really like
to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter,

18:27.564 --> 18:28.689
if it's okay with you.

18:28.857 --> 18:30.650
What a surprise.

18:30.818 --> 18:33.361
Did you invite me back
just so you could ignore me?

18:33.529 --> 18:35.196
Actually, I didn't invite you.

18:35.364 --> 18:36.697
You came in, you took a seat,

18:36.865 --> 18:39.492
and I'm not comfortable
with confrontation.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.788
Sheldon, this interview
is supposed to be about me.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.998
Well, that seems like a snooze.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.250
Even for public radio.

18:48.919 --> 18:50.586
You know,
if we did a shot every time

18:50.754 --> 18:51.796
they said something embarrassing,

18:51.964 --> 18:53.965
this would be one hell
of a drinking game.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.175
A little early for alcohol, isn't it?

18:56.343 --> 18:58.052
You know, I don't just say
smart things about science.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.428
I also yodel.

19:06.061 --> 19:07.186
I'll get the vodka.
