WEBVTT

00:03.336 --> 00:06.088
And here's another
interesting weather fact.

00:06.256 --> 00:08.757
Another? Great!

00:08.925 --> 00:12.011
Changes in jet streams
can affect the speed

00:12.178 --> 00:14.430
at which the Earth
rotates on its axis,

00:14.597 --> 00:17.933
so bad weather can actually
make the day longer.

00:18.101 --> 00:21.562
Well, there must be a hell
of a storm somewhere.

00:22.647 --> 00:26.650
Joke if you must, but you're
going to miss these moments.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.527
With Leonard home in a few days,

00:28.695 --> 00:31.530
this was your last time
driving me to the grocery store.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.824
You know, I will miss this.

00:33.992 --> 00:36.535
I'll tell you what,
if my apples are mealy,

00:36.703 --> 00:41.206
we'll hit the produce section
for one last crazy blowout.

00:41.374 --> 00:43.292
Heck, you can even push the cart.

00:44.461 --> 00:47.963
Please don't take my looking
forward to Leonard's return

00:48.131 --> 00:51.633
as criticism of the job you've
been doing in his absence.

00:51.801 --> 00:53.177
I won't.

00:53.344 --> 00:57.139
That criticism will come later
in your report card.

00:57.307 --> 00:59.224
Yeah, I didn't stay
for the detention,

00:59.392 --> 01:01.268
I'm not gonna read
the report card.

01:05.106 --> 01:08.275
- Hello.
- Leonard! Hi!

01:08.443 --> 01:10.027
- Sh! Keep your voice down.
- Oh, my God. You weren't supposed

01:10.195 --> 01:12.154
- to be here till Sunday!
- We finished the experiment early,

01:12.322 --> 01:13.822
so I thought I'd come home
and surprise you.

01:13.990 --> 01:15.351
Oh, my gosh,
why are we whispering?

01:15.366 --> 01:17.951
I didn't tell Sheldon
so we could have a few days alone.

01:18.119 --> 01:22.498
- Oh! That is so romantic.
- Sure, that's why I did it.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.959
I just cannot believe you're here.

01:26.127 --> 01:27.878
Penny, it's your lucky day!

01:28.046 --> 01:31.381
Three of the eggs are clearly
not jumbo. Grab your keys.

01:59.327 --> 02:02.830
Stuart, I was wondering
if you could help me find something.

02:02.997 --> 02:05.707
Happy to, unless it's hope
or a reason to live.

02:07.001 --> 02:09.920
Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown.

02:11.881 --> 02:15.050
Anyhoo, Leonard will be back
in a couple days

02:15.218 --> 02:17.386
and I need a welcome-home
gift for him.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.930
As he's been at sea,
perhaps something

02:20.098 --> 02:22.474
with a nautical theme
might be appropriate.

02:22.642 --> 02:25.352
Okay, well, I don't know
how much you want to spend,

02:25.520 --> 02:28.564
but I do have this pretty
cool Aquaman statue.

02:32.735 --> 02:36.822
Aquaman?
This isn't a gag gift, Stuart.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.909
Yeah, just as well.
It's a pretty rare piece.

02:41.077 --> 02:43.120
I'd rather just sell it
to a real collector.

02:43.288 --> 02:46.415
I'm a real collector.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.750
How rare is it?

02:48.918 --> 02:51.518
I shouldn't even have mentioned it.
How about a Batman squirt gun?

02:51.713 --> 02:52.796
Ye...

02:53.006 --> 02:56.633
Don't try and trick me
into buying something I don't want.

02:56.801 --> 02:58.719
Now, let's talk Aquaman.

02:58.887 --> 03:02.973
What were they thinking,
putting Doctor Octopus's mind

03:03.141 --> 03:04.808
in Spider-Man's body?

03:04.976 --> 03:06.810
Well, I've been quite enjoying that.

03:06.978 --> 03:09.271
It combines all the
superhero fun of Spider-Man

03:09.439 --> 03:12.232
with all the body-switching
shenanigans of Freaky Friday.

03:13.276 --> 03:16.069
Original and Lohan.

03:16.237 --> 03:19.573
Original and Lohan." You're an idiot.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.700
Hey, what's your problem?

03:21.868 --> 03:24.036
I'm sorry.
I've been kind of snippy lately.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.413
It's probably this stupid diet
I'm on.

03:26.581 --> 03:29.958
- Why are you on a diet?
- I've put on a couple pounds.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.795
Had to buy these pants
in the men's section.

03:35.798 --> 03:37.382
Well, we've all seen your mom.

03:39.135 --> 03:42.221
That Butterball turkey
was bound to come home to roost.

03:43.681 --> 03:47.309
Twelve-hundred dollars!
That's my final offer!

03:47.769 --> 03:49.519
All right, Sheldon, you win.

03:49.687 --> 03:51.730
I'm sure Leonard
is gonna love this.

03:51.940 --> 03:54.441
Oh, right, a present for Leonard.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.028
You better throw in that squirt gun.

03:58.196 --> 04:02.616
Hm... Yeah, I don't know.
This squirt gun, it's... it's pretty rare.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.160
Oh!

04:07.497 --> 04:11.041
And this is me doing
the Titanic pose on the boat.

04:11.167 --> 04:12.876
Oh!

04:13.086 --> 04:15.921
And... oh, that's me getting rescued
after I fell in.

04:16.130 --> 04:17.256
Oh.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.509
- Oh. That's the pizza.
- Yep.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.594
- Here's some money.
- Thank you.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.346
And I'm gonna hit the head.

04:24.514 --> 04:27.391
That's what us salty sea dogs say
when we have to go pee-pee.

04:30.144 --> 04:31.478
- Hey.
- Twenty-two, fifty.

04:31.646 --> 04:33.480
Okay, here's 25.
Keep the change.

04:33.648 --> 04:37.359
Seriously? I just walked up,
like, four flights of stairs.

04:37.527 --> 04:41.405
Oh, okay. Well, here's, um...

04:41.572 --> 04:43.156
Thirty-something cents,

04:43.324 --> 04:45.575
and a promise
I won't call your boss

04:45.743 --> 04:48.453
and tell him
you reek of marijuana.

04:50.206 --> 04:52.499
Oh, Penny, I see
you've ordered pizza.

04:52.667 --> 04:55.002
- I have Chinese food.
- That's nice.

04:55.169 --> 04:58.171
Oh, that's a rather earthy cologne.

05:00.925 --> 05:03.385
My uncle used to wear that.

05:04.137 --> 05:07.556
Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal
together before Leonard returns.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.766
Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel
like eating alone tonight, so...

05:09.934 --> 05:13.645
Are you sure? With your Italian pizza
and my Chinese noodles,

05:13.813 --> 05:15.272
we could play Marco Polo.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.150
I mean, of course,
a reenactment of a meal

05:18.318 --> 05:20.736
in the life of Marco Polo
the Venetian explorer,

05:20.903 --> 05:24.156
not Marco Polo
the terrifying water sport.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.534
Uh, yeah. It sounds fun,
but no thanks.

05:27.702 --> 05:28.702
Have a good night!

05:28.745 --> 05:32.080
- What, now, do you have company?
- No. No, no, no.

05:32.248 --> 05:33.749
You know what?
The toilet's been doing that.

05:33.916 --> 05:36.335
- I called the building manager, so...
- Oh, I can take a look at it.

05:36.502 --> 05:39.087
- Well...
- I'm quite familiar with plumbing.

05:39.255 --> 05:43.300
Not to brag, but I spent most of
fifth grade with my head in a toilet.

05:43.468 --> 05:46.178
Yeah, no, no, no.
You know what, Sheldon, it's okay.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.013
You don't have to go
into the bathroom.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.932
That's curious.
If there's no one here,

05:51.100 --> 05:54.186
why are there two glasses
of wine on the table?

05:54.354 --> 05:57.439
Oh. Well, you know,
I've got two hands

05:57.607 --> 05:59.816
and a bit of a drinking problem.

05:59.984 --> 06:02.569
Of course.
Ask a silly question.

06:04.989 --> 06:06.865
- That's odd.
- What?

06:07.033 --> 06:09.326
There are takeout containers
in the trash can.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.912
So? That's my dinner from last night.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.998
What's odd is they're
in the trash can.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.626
Okay. Look, honey,
I promise there's no one's here.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.394
I've had a long day. I just want
to have a quiet dinner by myself.

06:20.421 --> 06:22.672
Oh, very well.

06:22.840 --> 06:27.094
I'm no stranger to enjoying
the pleasures of solitude.

06:27.261 --> 06:29.513
- Oh!
- What?

06:29.680 --> 06:31.560
Have you gotten Leonard
a welcome-home gift yet?

06:31.641 --> 06:32.641
- No.
- Oh, great.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.685
Do you want to go halfsies
on a 200 dollar squirt gun?

06:39.148 --> 06:40.982
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

06:41.150 --> 06:42.651
I made some brownies.
You want one?

06:43.694 --> 06:45.320
You're kidding, right?

06:46.489 --> 06:49.491
I mean, you know
I'm trying to lose weight.

06:49.659 --> 06:52.994
God, I thought we were partners
in this marriage.

06:53.162 --> 06:56.540
We are. Stop it. And for the
last time, you're not fat.

06:56.707 --> 06:58.542
Really? Tell that
to the bathroom scale,

06:58.709 --> 07:00.919
'cause one of you is lying.

07:01.921 --> 07:05.382
Fine, forget I asked.
How was dinner at your mom's?

07:05.550 --> 07:08.927
Awful. I had to rub her ointment
all over her again.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.470
Why can't she do it?

07:10.638 --> 07:13.765
'Cause we've got a deeply
unhealthy relationship.

07:15.017 --> 07:16.435
Which reminds me,

07:16.602 --> 07:18.895
do you think you can get
any samples of this from work?

07:19.063 --> 07:20.230
This was supposed
to last her a month,

07:20.398 --> 07:23.442
but they didn't take into account
the square footage of her back.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.987
Let me see.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.531
How long have you been
putting this on her?

07:29.699 --> 07:31.741
I don't know.
Few weeks. Why?

07:31.909 --> 07:34.619
This is really strong estrogen cream.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.427
Please tell me
you've been wearing gloves.

07:36.497 --> 07:39.749
Like these swollen sausages
could fit in gloves.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.587
Howie, the estrogen's
getting absorbed by your skin.

07:43.754 --> 07:45.797
That's why you've been
all bloated and moody

07:45.965 --> 07:48.300
and a giant pain in the ass.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.595
You're full of estrogen
and you don't act like that.

07:51.762 --> 07:56.433
That's 'cause I'm a woman. I've had
years of practice riding the dragon.

07:58.352 --> 08:00.687
Fine. I'll wear gloves next time.

08:00.855 --> 08:03.732
It's still gonna take a few weeks for
the hormones to leave your system.

08:03.900 --> 08:08.111
I feel so stupid. And fat.

08:09.280 --> 08:12.240
It's okay.
You still look great to me.

08:12.408 --> 08:16.578
In fact, why don't we go in the
bedroom and I'll prove it to you?

08:16.746 --> 08:20.290
Sex? Really? I mean,
that's just your solution to everything!

08:22.835 --> 08:24.753
Oh, and here's a fun thing.

08:24.921 --> 08:27.631
I worked it out so that there are
two different words for spoon:

08:27.798 --> 08:30.425
"planko" and "janko."

08:30.593 --> 08:34.429
"Planko" is a spoon with food,
"janko" is a spoon without food.

08:36.140 --> 08:39.267
"Janko" is spelled
with a silent "ptang."

08:41.062 --> 08:44.898
Sheldon, you're not even listening
to the rules of my made-up language.

08:45.066 --> 08:48.276
- Yes, I am.
- Then what does "tweepadock" mean?

08:48.444 --> 08:49.653
Uh...

08:50.279 --> 08:51.321
Elephant?

08:52.406 --> 08:53.448
Lucky guess.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.369
I'm sorry.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.539
I'm just distracted by something
that happened over at Penny's.

09:00.706 --> 09:01.706
What happened?

09:01.874 --> 09:04.543
I fear Penny is being unfaithful
to Leonard.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.504
- What?
- She claimed to be alone

09:07.672 --> 09:10.799
when there was obviously
someone else in her apartment.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.301
I have no choice but
to assume the worst,

09:13.469 --> 09:15.470
given Leonard's lengthy sea voyage

09:15.638 --> 09:18.807
and her famously
ravenous nether regions.

09:20.142 --> 09:21.851
I don't think Penny
would cheat on Leonard.

09:22.019 --> 09:24.062
Oh, really?

09:25.898 --> 09:28.775
She and I once had
a staring contest.

09:28.943 --> 09:31.570
She clapped really loud
and made me blink.

09:33.114 --> 09:37.033
It's a small leap from there
to sexual infidelity.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.203
You're being ridiculous.

09:40.371 --> 09:45.292
Amy, there were Chinese
food containers... in the trash can.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.420
Poor Leonard.

09:54.260 --> 09:58.013
- Do you hear anything?
- I hear a woman's voice.

09:58.180 --> 10:00.724
- Is it Penny?
- No, it's you.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.687
All right,
I hear whispering and giggling.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.355
Now I think I hear kissing.

10:07.523 --> 10:10.275
Yeah, like you know
what kissing sounds like.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.987
There's kissing in Star Trek,
smarty-pants.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.697
Let me listen.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.744
- Sounds like Leonard.
- Please.

10:20.911 --> 10:24.748
Why would Leonard come home early
and waste his time kissing Penny

10:24.915 --> 10:27.542
when he could be hanging out
with his best buddy?

10:29.295 --> 10:32.130
Yeah, that's it.
I'm catching her in the act.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.424
No, Sheldon, don't.

10:34.819 --> 10:35.819
A-ha!

10:35.843 --> 10:38.303
- What the hell?!
- Leonard?

10:38.471 --> 10:40.391
Sheldon, you cannot just
barge in here like that!

10:40.431 --> 10:41.765
Right.

10:45.561 --> 10:48.355
Penny! Penny! Penny!

10:52.526 --> 10:54.069
Are you going to answer the door
or should I open it

10:54.236 --> 10:55.695
and say "a-ha" again?

11:00.743 --> 11:03.161
I'm sorry, Sheldon.
I should've told you I was back.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.409
I just wanted to have
a couple days alone with Penny.

11:05.414 --> 11:07.540
Oh, no, I should apologize.

11:07.708 --> 11:11.378
I never realized to what extent
our friendship was a burden to you.

11:11.545 --> 11:13.088
That is not fair.

11:13.255 --> 11:16.383
I complain about what a burden it is
at least once a month.

11:16.550 --> 11:18.176
Oh, no, no, let's not sugarcoat this.

11:18.344 --> 11:21.846
You find me finicky,
pedantic and annoying.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.181
No, he doesn't.

11:23.349 --> 11:26.768
I actually have used
those exact words before.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.104
In that order.

11:30.606 --> 11:32.440
Well, Leonard,
I think it's high time

11:32.608 --> 11:35.735
you and I address
the "tweepadock" in the room.

11:37.154 --> 11:38.405
- The what?
- Amy?

11:38.572 --> 11:41.199
- Please leave me out of this.
- Fine.

11:41.367 --> 11:45.161
Leonard, there's no need for you
to pretend to like me anymore.

11:45.329 --> 11:48.415
- Come on, I said I was sorry.
- No, no, you save your apologies

11:48.582 --> 11:51.751
for after you've had
disappointing coitus with Penny.

11:54.296 --> 11:56.464
It was fine.

11:56.632 --> 11:58.133
Come on, this is silly.

11:58.300 --> 12:02.595
Hey, I brought you back
a little present from my trip, huh?

12:04.557 --> 12:07.517
It's that sailor cap that you wanted.
It's neat, huh?

12:09.186 --> 12:12.814
You honestly think you can buy back
my friendship with a cheap souvenir?

12:13.983 --> 12:17.110
I don't. No, I really don't.
Just try it on.

12:21.949 --> 12:23.030
- Oh, yeah.
- Hello, sailor.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.951
Now we're talking.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.288
Excuse me.

12:37.047 --> 12:38.882
This changes nothing.

12:40.092 --> 12:42.343
Except the Halloween costume
I'm wearing this year.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.848
Amy, you're going to be Olive Oyl.
Lay off the donuts.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.688
- Thanks for coming over.
- No problem.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.148
Ooh! You made little sandwiches!

12:55.316 --> 12:57.901
Yeah, that's cucumber
and cream cheese.

12:58.068 --> 12:59.611
That's turkey and loganberry.

12:59.779 --> 13:03.490
And don't tell my hips, but I'm
warming up a brie in the oven.

13:03.657 --> 13:05.492
Nice. So...

13:06.368 --> 13:07.368
What's up?

13:07.536 --> 13:10.705
Okay, well, I've been reading up
on all the side effects

13:10.873 --> 13:15.668
you can get from estrogen, and...
I need you to be honest with me.

13:16.754 --> 13:19.130
Do my boobs look bigger to you?

13:20.674 --> 13:22.801
Well, it's kind of hard to tell.

13:22.968 --> 13:24.803
Come on, Raj,
it's a "yes or no" question.

13:24.970 --> 13:27.680
I'm not sure. Um... Wait.

13:27.848 --> 13:30.683
Jump up and down,
let's see if they jiggle.

13:38.192 --> 13:41.069
No, I... I still can't tell. Uh...

13:41.278 --> 13:44.447
Oh, you know what?
Okay, give me some of this.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.077
- Seriously?
- Do you want my help or not?

13:50.746 --> 13:52.247
Fine.

13:57.419 --> 13:59.087
Okay, yup.

13:59.255 --> 14:02.590
See, see, that looks like...
that looks like they could be bigger.

14:04.009 --> 14:07.637
But, you know, I bet... I bet when
I do it, mine do the same thing.

14:12.434 --> 14:15.520
- Yeah, they kind of do.
- Hm... Let me see something.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.438
Hey, easy!

14:18.691 --> 14:22.360
- My nipples are sensitive.
- Oh. Sorry, sorry.

14:23.737 --> 14:25.488
Okay.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.662
I mean...

14:34.206 --> 14:36.207
Yeah, maybe.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.626
Okay, let me feel.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.971
No, I am definitely up a cup size.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.932
You know, but they're very firm,
so you've got that going for you.

14:53.100 --> 14:56.102
- You think?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, very perky.

14:57.396 --> 15:00.356
Thank you.
I really needed to hear that today.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.361
- Ooh! Brie's ready!
- Yay!

15:10.951 --> 15:13.077
- Good morning.
- Hello.

15:14.622 --> 15:17.415
So am I driving you to work,
or are you still mad at me?

15:17.583 --> 15:19.000
I'd like a ride.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.754
Assuming you actually do
take me to work.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.547
Where do you think I would take you?

15:24.715 --> 15:28.927
Who knows? You said
you'd be home yesterday,

15:29.094 --> 15:30.803
but you came home three days ago.

15:30.971 --> 15:34.182
You say you're taking me
to work, but for all I know,

15:34.350 --> 15:38.144
I'll end up
in a deserted amusement park.

15:38.312 --> 15:40.980
Or a cornfield maze.

15:41.148 --> 15:44.150
Or a back-alley dog fight.
You tell me.

15:45.694 --> 15:47.570
I'm going to work.
You can come if you want.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.405
Okay.

15:50.366 --> 15:53.159
By the way, you have
something on your shirt.

15:53.327 --> 15:56.454
- No, I don't.
- Hurts, doesn't it?

16:01.627 --> 16:03.211
You know, I find myself wondering

16:03.379 --> 16:06.297
if anything you've
ever told me is true.

16:06.465 --> 16:09.759
I didn't make it back.
The ship sank, I'm in hell.

16:12.221 --> 16:16.683
You say you're from New Jersey,
but how can I believe you?

16:16.850 --> 16:20.228
Why would anyone claim to be
from New Jersey if they weren't?

16:22.398 --> 16:24.399
All right, I'll give you that one.

16:26.026 --> 16:28.820
Hey, I said I was sorry.
What else do you want from me?

16:28.988 --> 16:31.239
I want you to admit that
what you did was wrong.

16:31.407 --> 16:34.409
Fine. What I did was wrong.

16:34.576 --> 16:36.494
I wish I could believe you.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.914
You know what?
I'm not driving you to work,

16:40.082 --> 16:41.624
because you're incredibly annoying.

16:41.792 --> 16:44.002
You say one thing and do the other,

16:44.169 --> 16:48.256
so then you are driving me
and you find me a delight.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.216
- Stop it.
- Keep it up?

16:50.384 --> 16:52.552
- Bye!
- Hello!

16:57.182 --> 17:00.560
So I guess you're really
holding up the other four fingers?

17:04.064 --> 17:05.773
Oh, hey, what are you
doing here so early?

17:05.941 --> 17:08.568
- Driving Sheldon to work.
- He's still mad at Leonard, huh?

17:08.736 --> 17:10.111
He's mad at you, too.

17:10.279 --> 17:13.740
He says you're the succubus
who led his friend astray.

17:15.617 --> 17:18.661
I don't know
what "succubus" is, but...

17:18.829 --> 17:21.039
it has "suck" in it,
so that can't be good.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.376
- Thought I heard you out here.
- Hey, Sheldon.

17:25.544 --> 17:28.713
You don't get a "hey."
You get a "hmm."

17:28.881 --> 17:30.631
Come on, don't be like that.

17:30.799 --> 17:33.051
We had so much fun together
the last couple of months.

17:33.218 --> 17:36.137
You're right. Which makes your
betrayal all the more devastating.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.972
- Sheldon...
- I let you buy

17:38.140 --> 17:41.142
feminine hygiene products
with my supermarket club card.

17:42.770 --> 17:46.105
You have any idea the kind of coupons
I'm going to get in the mail now?

17:47.483 --> 17:50.318
Sheldon, your fight's with Leonard.
Penny's got nothing to do...

17:50.486 --> 17:51.944
Careful, Amy.

17:52.112 --> 17:55.823
The friend of my enemy's girlfriend
is my enemy.

17:55.991 --> 17:57.492
- Really?
- Yes.

17:57.659 --> 17:59.494
You're either with me or against me.

17:59.661 --> 18:01.746
You want to take the bus to work?

18:03.707 --> 18:04.874
Maybe there's a third option.

18:07.461 --> 18:11.172
FYI, I had a doughnut
for breakfast, you jerk.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.635
So now we're just waiting
for the data

18:15.803 --> 18:19.347
from the ship to be crunched, but the
numbers look pretty promising.

18:19.515 --> 18:23.351
That's so great. If you guys prove
the existence of Unruh radiation...

18:23.519 --> 18:25.394
Hey, hey, hey!
My eyes are up here.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.858
Howard, Raj, Judas.

18:31.985 --> 18:34.695
You know what?
You're a crazy person.

18:34.863 --> 18:36.864
A crazy person with a long memory,

18:37.032 --> 18:39.992
and if all goes according to plan,
a robot army.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.079
- Stop it.
- Or a mutant army.

18:43.247 --> 18:45.706
It depends on how
my Kickstarter goes.

18:47.209 --> 18:49.460
I said stop it!

18:49.628 --> 18:51.754
Now, listen to me.

18:51.922 --> 18:54.966
You two aren't just friends.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.926
You're best friends.

18:57.886 --> 19:00.263
And that's a beautiful thing.

19:01.974 --> 19:05.810
I mean, Leonard, you know
why he's so mad at you?

19:05.978 --> 19:08.271
It's 'cause he missed you!

19:08.438 --> 19:11.357
Yeah, and as his friend,
you should be happy

19:11.525 --> 19:15.194
he has love in his life.

19:15.362 --> 19:17.280
As I do.

19:19.324 --> 19:22.743
This man held my breast
the other day, and I love him for it.

19:24.746 --> 19:26.831
A little loud, dude.

19:29.251 --> 19:33.212
So can we please put aside
these petty differences

19:33.380 --> 19:36.674
and just be glad
we're here together?

19:39.136 --> 19:40.469
- Okay.
- I suppose so.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.430
Thank you.

19:44.391 --> 19:47.143
It wasn't anything weird.
It was just to see how big they were.

19:53.317 --> 19:56.277
And then Leonard took me
to the barber and the dentist,

19:56.445 --> 19:58.196
and then to cap off the perfect day,

19:58.363 --> 20:01.407
the Los Angeles Bureau
of Weights and Measures.

20:02.784 --> 20:05.286
I thought the measures were
going to be the stars of the show.

20:05.454 --> 20:08.080
Turns out it was the weights.

20:08.248 --> 20:11.083
I'm so glad you guys
are friends again.

20:11.251 --> 20:14.378
And I'm glad you and I
are friends again, too.

20:14.546 --> 20:17.924
Which reminds me. This came in the
mail, and I want you to have it.

20:18.091 --> 20:21.427
"Fifty cents off Vagisil."

20:23.055 --> 20:25.598
Think of me when you apply it.

20:28.477 --> 20:31.771
Can I just say, I've missed
all of us hanging out together.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.439
- Yeah.
- Me, too.

20:33.607 --> 20:37.818
Um, since when can Koothrappali talk
in front of the girls without a beer?

20:37.986 --> 20:39.946
Oh, that happened
right after you left.

20:40.113 --> 20:41.489
And no one told me?

20:41.657 --> 20:45.076
Can't believe we forgot to tell him.

20:46.828 --> 20:49.664
Ahem. Think of Sheldon
when you apply it.
