00:04.422 --> 00:07.091
Oh, my God!
Cinnamon, are you okay?

00:07.258 --> 00:09.885
What is...?
Can't believe you two!

00:10.052 --> 00:11.387
Americans.

00:14.765 --> 00:17.268
Three bags, no one's....
(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)

00:19.603 --> 00:20.646
(STAMMERING)

00:20.771 --> 00:21.772
Sorry.

00:24.066 --> 00:26.444
Oh, my God!
Cinnamon, are you okay?

00:26.610 --> 00:28.154
I can't believe you two!

00:28.320 --> 00:30.865
You do whatever it takes to save
her life. If she needs new organs....

00:30.948 --> 00:32.366
(GIBBERING)
(GROANS)

00:35.411 --> 00:37.163
Amy, I could use your help.

00:37.329 --> 00:40.958
Let me guess. There's an undergrad
in a leather jecket. Jecket.

00:43.127 --> 00:45.212
We've got to get her
to a vet, like, right now.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.423
I don't have a vet,
I have a podiatrist,

00:47.590 --> 00:49.884
an optometrist....
(STAMMERING) Oh, balls.

00:52.887 --> 00:53.888
Thank you, Rajesh.

00:54.055 --> 00:57.224
And, Amy, you need
to be patient. Sorry.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.185
I hate when you do that.

00:59.351 --> 01:02.605
- It's your fault.
- I wasn't even looking at you.

01:03.564 --> 01:06.192
- Thank you, Rajesh.
- And Amy....

01:06.358 --> 01:08.569
Why are you laughing?

01:10.321 --> 01:11.989
What is going on?

01:13.032 --> 01:14.784
- Hello, Emily.
- Hello.

01:14.950 --> 01:18.996
Amy told me you might have
some doubts about something.

01:19.163 --> 01:21.040
(LAUGHING)

01:21.165 --> 01:23.793
Fine. I'm not sure
you should have quit.

01:23.959 --> 01:26.003
But if....
(STAMMERING)

01:26.170 --> 01:27.421
Let's do it again.

01:28.214 --> 01:30.841
I know it.
Get out of here.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.761
Okay, if you support me,
what was with that phone call?

01:34.595 --> 01:37.014
Fine. I'm not sure
you should have quit.

01:37.181 --> 01:40.518
But if.... (STAMMERING)
Oh, my God. I know it. I know it.

01:41.644 --> 01:43.521
I know it. I know it. I know it.

01:43.687 --> 01:45.815
But... Ah, let me see it.

01:47.608 --> 01:48.859
MAN: Action!

01:49.610 --> 01:51.237
Oh, I'm sorry, from where?

01:52.947 --> 01:56.909
So how are you going to return
the DVD if.... Start that again.

01:57.868 --> 02:02.748
So heads is PS4, tails is Xbox...
(GIBBERING)

02:04.917 --> 02:06.127
Are you kidding me?

02:06.168 --> 02:08.170
This may be the biggest
scientific breakthrough

02:08.337 --> 02:11.298
of our lifetime.
How can you, as a... (STAMMERING)?

02:11.465 --> 02:13.342
Right from there, sorry.

02:13.509 --> 02:15.719
MAN: Start up there and action.

02:15.886 --> 02:16.929
Are you kidding me?

02:17.012 --> 02:18.514
This may be the biggest
scientific breakthrough

02:18.681 --> 02:22.268
of our lifetime. How can you,
as a theoretical physicist say....

02:22.393 --> 02:23.394
(CHUCKLING)

02:25.229 --> 02:26.814
Oh, I know it. I know it.

02:28.899 --> 02:31.777
I'm saying you and string theory
sound like a relationship

02:31.944 --> 02:34.113
but I know
what it's like to be when....

02:36.907 --> 02:39.910
Sheldon, what do you want me to do?
Hide the information?

02:40.077 --> 02:42.580
If I don't publit it... Wow!
(CHUCKLING)

02:44.081 --> 02:47.293
The lecture was on cosmic...
What was it on? Sorry.

02:48.419 --> 02:49.670
And, if it's a clear night,

02:49.795 --> 02:52.756
I'm going to lay some
romantic astronomy on her.

02:53.674 --> 02:56.385
Really? Is that my line?

02:58.262 --> 03:01.640
My wife's in New York and I've got
a <i>Lion King</i> resigual check

03:01.807 --> 03:03.100
burning a hole in my pocket.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.813
And I can say "residual"
better than that.

03:07.980 --> 03:09.857
Wait, now that we've cleared the air,

03:10.024 --> 03:12.610
I wanted to discuss
another matter with you.

03:12.776 --> 03:16.238
Sheldon, in a cow...
a couple... in a coward....?

03:18.824 --> 03:19.950
MAN: Oh, you're already on, sorry.

03:20.117 --> 03:23.120
Yeah, this scene really doesn't
get going until I leave.

03:23.245 --> 03:24.538
(LAUGHING)

03:27.499 --> 03:29.960
They just try to clone me
from my corpse but my DNA

03:30.127 --> 03:32.630
gets mixed with the ape's DNA
and I end up running around with...

03:32.755 --> 03:33.672
(STAMMERING)

03:37.384 --> 03:40.221
Thank you. Oh, and....
(STAMMERING)

03:40.346 --> 03:42.806
- (LAUGHING)
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

03:42.973 --> 03:46.018
I was not going to propose.
It's already two to one.

03:47.311 --> 03:49.146
- What's two to one?
- You proposed twice--

03:49.313 --> 03:50.814
Oh! I'm sorry!

03:52.733 --> 03:53.651
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

03:53.776 --> 03:55.277
- (SHOUTING)
- (SHOUTING)

03:59.490 --> 04:01.450
- To the planetarium!
- Let's go!

04:03.160 --> 04:04.536
(LAUGHING)

04:06.038 --> 04:07.498
We have the cheapest car.

04:07.665 --> 04:09.208
The worst car ever.

04:09.375 --> 04:10.918
- Hi.
- Hey, guys.

04:11.085 --> 04:13.170
Look who's here to put the....

04:13.295 --> 04:14.380
(LAUGHING)

04:16.840 --> 04:19.969
I will slowly seduce her....
(LAUGHING)

04:22.429 --> 04:24.848
Do I miss how we say
good night to each other

04:25.015 --> 04:28.018
through the walls
of our bedroom using Morse code?

04:28.102 --> 04:29.645
(KNOCKING)

04:34.191 --> 04:36.193
- To the tar pits!
- Let's go!

04:45.536 --> 04:47.955
Why don't you take your time,
enjoy your freedom?

04:48.122 --> 04:50.624
Maybe something new
to study will find you.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.626
- (CLANKING)
- Oh, man.

04:55.212 --> 04:58.340
Penny, I just wanted to say good luck
and I hope there's no hard feelings.

04:58.507 --> 05:02.386
Hey, Romeo, repair your relationship
on your own time!

05:04.972 --> 05:08.058
- Oh!
- In the face.

05:09.727 --> 05:13.022
Penny, I just wanted to say good luck
and I hope there's no hard feelings.

05:13.188 --> 05:16.859
Hey, Romeo, repair your relationship
on your own time!

05:18.068 --> 05:20.362
Sorry. That was... Sorry!

05:20.529 --> 05:22.698
I just wanted to say good luck
and I hope there's no hard feelings.

05:22.865 --> 05:26.410
Hey, Romeo, repair your relationship
on your own time!

05:28.287 --> 05:30.039
(LAUGHING)

05:31.665 --> 05:34.752
So your boyfriend's a fixer-upper.
Most of them are.

05:34.918 --> 05:37.129
Look at this guy.
(COUGHS) Sorry, I'm choking.

05:38.589 --> 05:41.425
I know you don't like change,
but it's not a terrible idea.

05:41.592 --> 05:44.053
Hey, you never used....
(CLEARS THROAT, COUGHS)

05:46.138 --> 05:49.141
Kind of hit a bump
When I was....

05:49.266 --> 05:50.601
(MUMBLING)

05:51.602 --> 05:52.603
Sorry. Sorry.

05:52.770 --> 05:55.397
So I thought if I watch it....
(CLEARING THROAT, MUMBLING)

05:58.567 --> 06:00.152
- MAN: Action.
- Sorry.

06:04.406 --> 06:06.241
MAN 1: Okay, still rolling, guys.

06:06.408 --> 06:07.826
MAN 2: Same spot. Here we go.

06:07.993 --> 06:10.204
It's radio, Fay, it's fine.

06:12.998 --> 06:16.168
Why am I upset, just because
he's off having a good time?

06:16.335 --> 06:18.921
Perhaps you're obsessively
picturing him

06:19.088 --> 06:22.341
engaged in drunken coitus
with another woman.

06:32.184 --> 06:34.895
Perhaps you're obsessively
picturing him

06:35.062 --> 06:38.315
engaged in drunken coitus
with another woman.

06:42.236 --> 06:43.695
(LAUGHING)

06:44.988 --> 06:49.034
Here we go.
<i>A House of a Thousand Corpses.</i>

06:49.910 --> 06:51.954
Bad acting choice. All right.

06:53.080 --> 06:57.584
First, I think anyone who uses their
birthday for a password is an idiot.

06:59.253 --> 07:00.754
Thank you.

07:05.634 --> 07:06.677
That is funny.

07:08.846 --> 07:11.348
Please. Bernadette's bringing her dad
'cause her mom's out of town

07:11.515 --> 07:13.100
and I never have anything
to say to that guy.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.185
- You, I'm going to kill you!
- I'm sorry.

07:20.566 --> 07:24.361
How many of those women did you think
would become your perfect companion?

07:24.528 --> 07:27.239
Wait, do I count
the 200-pound <i>Sailor Moon</i> girl

07:27.406 --> 07:29.700
that Howard and I had a threesome
with at Comic-Con?

07:36.457 --> 07:39.168
My mother would lock her car doors
if she had to drive through

07:39.334 --> 07:41.253
this hodgepodge of ethnicity.

08:02.900 --> 08:05.068
I don't have to go
to the bathroom anymore.

08:15.746 --> 08:18.457
I don't have to go
to the bathroom anymore.

08:30.385 --> 08:32.596
I don't have to go
to the bathroom anymore.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.733
