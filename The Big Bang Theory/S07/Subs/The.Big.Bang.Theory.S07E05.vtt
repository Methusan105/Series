WEBVTT

00:06.297 --> 00:09.091
Awkward silence.
Sheldon on his phone.

00:09.259 --> 00:13.345
No touching.
Somebody's having date night.

00:13.513 --> 00:15.639
It's actually steamier than it looks.

00:15.807 --> 00:18.600
Sheldon's looking up the phallic
symbolism of root vegetables

00:18.768 --> 00:19.977
in Renaissance paintings.

00:20.228 --> 00:22.563
Oh, no, I got bored with that.

00:22.731 --> 00:25.607
I'm just browsing cuticle scissors
on Amazon.

00:26.776 --> 00:30.779
How do you not tear off his clothes
and take him here on this table?

00:30.947 --> 00:33.449
If you do that, I'll scream.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.787
Sheldon, I have some exciting news
to tell you.

00:38.955 --> 00:41.623
That makes two of us.
My new cuticle scissors will be here

00:41.791 --> 00:43.625
in one to two business days.

00:43.793 --> 00:45.919
Come on, one.

00:46.087 --> 00:48.297
I've been invited to consult
on an experiment

00:48.465 --> 00:50.382
at your university for a few months.

00:50.550 --> 00:53.135
Isn't that great?
We could have lunch together.

00:53.303 --> 00:54.511
We could carpool.

00:54.679 --> 00:58.974
You know, riding with Leonard
has gotten a little tedious lately.

00:59.142 --> 01:02.269
The only car game he ever wants
to play is the Quiet Game.

01:02.437 --> 01:05.564
And he's terrible at it.
I always win.

01:07.358 --> 01:10.652
- So, you're okay with this?
- Well, why wouldn't I be?

01:10.820 --> 01:12.863
Well, this project
would have us working

01:13.031 --> 01:14.573
in close proximity to one another.

01:14.741 --> 01:19.828
And there's the vulgar adage that one
should not defecate where one eats.

01:19.996 --> 01:22.498
My father used to say
that all the time.

01:22.665 --> 01:25.667
That and, "Who does one have
to orally gratify

01:25.835 --> 01:28.003
to get a drink around here?"

01:30.924 --> 01:33.801
But what does that have to do
with you working at the university?

01:33.968 --> 01:36.553
Sheldon,
"Don't defecate where you eat,"

01:36.721 --> 01:40.015
means don't have a romantic
relationship in the workplace.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.185
Really?

01:46.356 --> 01:47.689
Yes.

01:47.774 --> 01:48.649
Huh...

01:48.733 --> 01:50.901
I always took it literally.

01:52.195 --> 01:55.864
That's why I have never once moved
my bowels in this or any restaurant.

01:58.243 --> 02:01.370
I'm relieved that you don't have
a problem with us working together.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.539
Not as relieved as I'm about to be.

02:04.749 --> 02:06.834
It's a brave new world, little lady.

02:34.571 --> 02:35.988
Are you crazy?

02:36.156 --> 02:39.116
You don't want
your girlfriend at work with you.

02:39.284 --> 02:40.909
Hell Clam.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.036
Why not?

02:43.204 --> 02:45.164
Hairy Fairy.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.457
I think it could be romantic.

02:47.625 --> 02:49.426
You know, my parents met
at his place of work.

02:49.502 --> 02:52.504
Your father's a gynecologist.

02:52.589 --> 02:56.508
I know. What started as a pap smear
turned into a date.

02:58.094 --> 02:59.887
Which turned into her working there,
which turned into marriage,

03:00.054 --> 03:03.307
which then turned into hatred,
which continues to this day.

03:04.100 --> 03:06.310
Two-Eyed Cyclops.

03:07.228 --> 03:09.229
Would you please tell him
this isn't a good idea?

03:09.397 --> 03:10.731
No. I think it'll be great.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.740
Maybe next time he gets
conjunctivitis at work,

03:12.775 --> 03:15.194
she can hold his head and try to put
the drops in his eyes.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.947
Giant baby.

03:19.282 --> 03:20.991
That's a Raging Ogre.

03:21.075 --> 03:22.910
I know.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.206
I'm just saying, I'd never want
to work with Bernadette.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.958
Can you imagine seeing
someone all day long

03:30.126 --> 03:32.606
and then you're supposed to hang out
with them after work, too?

03:32.712 --> 03:34.033
Hold on. We do that all the time.

03:34.088 --> 03:35.923
You and I work together
and play together.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.426
I know, and it drove me
into the arms of another woman.

03:41.512 --> 03:43.430
Bipolar Bear.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.433
Well, I appreciate your concern,

03:46.601 --> 03:49.228
but I won't be seeing any more of Amy
than I already do.

03:49.395 --> 03:51.688
I assume we'll deduct any extra time
we spend together

03:51.856 --> 03:54.233
at work from our weekly quota.

03:56.527 --> 03:59.196
Please let me be there
when you tell her that.

04:00.323 --> 04:01.963
Why? So you can see the look
on Amy's face

04:02.033 --> 04:04.785
when she hears my top-notch idea?

04:04.869 --> 04:07.120
Please, oh please,
just let me be there.

04:09.832 --> 04:12.334
So, Amy, what are you gonna be
working on at Caltech?

04:12.460 --> 04:13.919
I'm leading a study to see

04:14.087 --> 04:16.087
if deficiency of the monoamine
oxidase enzyme leads

04:16.172 --> 04:19.007
to paralyzing fear in monkeys.

04:19.133 --> 04:21.760
If they're anything like humans,
the answer's yes.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.304
Wait, you've done this
experiment on humans?

04:24.430 --> 04:27.099
You mean like death row inmates
with nothing to lose?

04:27.225 --> 04:29.309
No, that would be unethical.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.523
Not a lot of people know this,
but the monoamine oxidase enzyme

04:34.649 --> 04:36.358
was discovered by a woman,
Mary Bernheim.

04:39.654 --> 04:43.031
That's right. My phone is
just as smart as you guys.

04:45.201 --> 04:46.326
Amy, Bernadette, Penny.

04:47.495 --> 04:49.871
Amy, Bernadette, Penny.

04:51.499 --> 04:53.060
He's never gonna stop doing that,
is he?

04:53.084 --> 04:55.836
I don't mind. I'm hoping to put
his love of repetition

04:55.962 --> 04:57.629
to good use someday.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.719
Um, I've reconsidered.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.137
You can't work where I work.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.556
- Enjoy the rest of your evening.
- Sheldon.

05:08.224 --> 05:11.143
I already signed the contract.
I cashed a check.

05:11.352 --> 05:12.644
Hmm.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.939
You are not going
to come out of this looking good.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.108
Sheldon, I don't understand.
I thought you were fine with it.

05:18.276 --> 05:21.194
Well, I was. But that was before
Howard explained to me

05:21.362 --> 05:24.865
how awful it would be if he had
to work with his significant other.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.075
He said what?

05:27.869 --> 05:29.328
Now, don't be insulted.

05:29.412 --> 05:33.498
He just thinks too much of you would
be mind-numbingly tedious.

05:34.792 --> 05:36.793
Excuse me, I need to have a chat
with my husband.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.962
Well, now, keep it short.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.923
From what I gather,
brevity is your friend.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.260
So, are we good here?

05:45.345 --> 05:48.513
No, we're not good here.
I am working on this project.

05:48.556 --> 05:50.724
Yeah, you can't tell her
what she can and cannot do.

05:50.808 --> 05:52.528
Last week, you told Leonard
he couldn't wear

05:52.602 --> 05:54.436
his Wookiee jacket out in public.

05:55.855 --> 05:57.535
That's different.
I'm not going to the mall

05:57.565 --> 06:00.233
with someone dressed
like a dumb space bear.

06:02.278 --> 06:03.737
Sheldon, you don't have to worry
about me bothering you.

06:03.905 --> 06:05.238
I'll be in a different building,

06:05.406 --> 06:07.407
and we don't even have
to have lunch together.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.867
- Really?
- Yes.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.119
Before all things, I'm a scientist.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.080
I'm just there to do my work
and, with a little luck,

06:13.247 --> 06:16.291
scare the living crap
out of some monkeys.

06:17.293 --> 06:18.794
Hmm.

06:20.296 --> 06:22.714
You sure your moth-like personality
won't be drawn

06:22.799 --> 06:25.050
to this blazing fire that is myself?

06:28.596 --> 06:30.430
More and more sure.

06:31.557 --> 06:34.768
- Well, then, you have my permission.
- I didn't ask for your permission.

06:34.852 --> 06:36.770
Too late. No backsies.

06:38.523 --> 06:41.024
No, no, listen to me.
Sheldon misunderstood.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.943
What I meant was,
if we worked together,

06:43.027 --> 06:46.905
there'd be too much of me for you,
not the other way around.

06:46.989 --> 06:49.533
Howard, if you're going to lie
to your wife,

06:49.617 --> 06:51.743
don't start the sentence
with "Sheldon misunderstood."

06:53.538 --> 06:56.581
- That's a dead giveaway.
- Well?

06:56.666 --> 06:58.667
Okay, fine. I did say that,
and I think it's true.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.755
I think if we worked together
and lived together,

07:00.837 --> 07:03.130
we'd get sick of each other.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.937
But to be fair, he only said the part
about him getting sick of you.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.592
For the love of God, why?!

07:12.181 --> 07:14.683
What exactly do you think
you'd get sick of?

07:14.767 --> 07:19.062
His only options here are to fake
a heart attack or have a real one.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.773
It's nothing in particular.

07:21.941 --> 07:24.568
Is it my voice?
Am I too bossy?

07:25.945 --> 07:28.196
My arm is feeling numb.

07:30.241 --> 07:31.616
Nailed it.

07:33.202 --> 07:35.954
That's the wrong arm
for a heart attack, doofus.

07:38.166 --> 07:41.460
My point is, I'm sure there are
things about me

07:41.544 --> 07:44.880
that would drive you crazy if you had
to deal with them all day long.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.257
Like looking me in the eye
and lying to me?

07:47.341 --> 07:48.967
Come on, I just...

07:49.010 --> 07:51.845
Where am I supposed to look
when I lie to you?

07:52.346 --> 07:54.389
Find somewhere else
to sleep tonight.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.891
Bernie...

08:03.274 --> 08:06.985
If it makes you feel any better,
Amy and I are fine.

08:09.530 --> 08:11.656
I mean, really good.

08:14.368 --> 08:16.578
So, boys,
how was the pajama party?

08:16.621 --> 08:20.457
You guys jump on the bed
and sing into hair brushes?

08:20.500 --> 08:22.667
It wasn't a pajama party.

08:22.710 --> 08:25.170
It was just a couple of bros
hanging out, giggling,

08:25.254 --> 08:27.964
eating cookie dough
and watching Princess Bride.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.051
Please, stop talking.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.680
"As you wish."

08:40.019 --> 08:41.811
You know, Sheldon,
none of this would've happened

08:41.896 --> 08:43.772
if I hadn't tried to help you.

08:43.981 --> 08:47.025
It also wouldn't have happened
if, in the early universe,

08:47.109 --> 08:50.403
hydrogen was a little more common
or a little less common.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.531
This is fun. Your turn.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.325
- Gentlemen.
- Hey, Amy.

08:55.409 --> 08:56.993
Hello.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.955
That was kind of icy.
You two okay?

08:59.997 --> 09:02.290
We're fine.
As Howard advised,

09:02.375 --> 09:04.918
she's merely respecting
our professional boundaries.

09:05.044 --> 09:07.170
Smart. Take relationship advice
from a man

09:07.296 --> 09:09.381
who spent last night
braiding Raj's hair.

09:13.177 --> 09:15.220
You make a good point.

09:15.346 --> 09:17.264
It would appear I was worried
for nothing.

09:17.348 --> 09:20.684
Look at her, desperately wishing
she was over here at the cool table.

09:23.271 --> 09:27.107
Don't worry, little moth.
The flame will come to you.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.738
On the off chance that Bernadette
doesn't call back and apologize,

09:33.823 --> 09:37.075
how do you feel about Mexican food
for dinner tonight?

09:37.159 --> 09:38.535
I don't know.
Sounds kind of heavy.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.580
That's 'cause you always fill up
on chips.

09:41.622 --> 09:44.040
And this is Dr. Gunderson
from Stockholm.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.625
Ah, Sweden.

09:45.751 --> 09:50.171
Home of my favorite Muppet
and second favorite meatball.

09:53.968 --> 09:57.762
Okay, the Nordic reputation
for lack of humor is well-founded.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.933
Boy, is his name Gunderson
or No-Funderson?

10:04.103 --> 10:05.645
Where are we going with this,
Dr. Cooper?

10:05.688 --> 10:10.150
Please, I'm your boyfriend.
You call me Sheldon.

10:10.192 --> 10:13.111
That's right,
I am in a boy-girl relationship

10:13.154 --> 10:15.572
with this cute little lump of wool.

10:15.656 --> 10:18.658
- Sheldon...
- It's a physical relationship, too.

10:18.743 --> 10:22.203
Hand-holding, hugging...
even on hot days.

10:23.664 --> 10:24.831
Ow!

10:24.999 --> 10:26.249
Okay, here's a new one.

10:26.334 --> 10:29.169
Apparently now we kick each other
in the shin under the table.

10:30.921 --> 10:32.631
How do you like it
when I do it to you?

10:35.635 --> 10:37.552
Not so much, huh?

10:46.979 --> 10:48.772
Test subject D7,

10:48.939 --> 10:51.399
aka Betsy, fear response study.

10:51.525 --> 10:54.778
Frenchman
on bicycle carrying baguettes.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.284
No visible reaction.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.286
Sousaphone.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.541
Still no reaction. Okay.

11:08.584 --> 11:10.251
Let's kick things up a notch.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.712
Crocodile
with a mouthful of monkeys.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.260
Okay, now we're talking.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.888
Dr. Fowler?

11:21.972 --> 11:23.890
What do you want, Sheldon?

11:24.016 --> 11:26.476
Well, I'm done with work, so...

11:27.311 --> 11:29.187
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

11:29.271 --> 11:30.980
Sorry.

11:31.982 --> 11:33.358
Better?

11:33.484 --> 11:35.985
Baguettes.
Yes, I like baguettes.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.030
What exactly are you doing?

11:39.156 --> 11:41.533
Determining baseline fear levels
in capuchin monkeys

11:41.617 --> 11:43.618
by measuring their response
to visual stimuli.

11:43.744 --> 11:44.994
So, goofing off.

11:47.832 --> 11:50.834
As I was saying, I'm done with work
and Leonard's not.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.044
So good news,
you get to take me home.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.672
Play your cards right,
I'll let you drive me

11:55.756 --> 11:58.758
past the lot
where the buses park at night.

11:58.801 --> 12:01.803
I can't leave now, Sheldon.
I'm very busy.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.471
Besides, why would I want to do you
a favor

12:03.556 --> 12:05.598
after the way you treated me
in the cafeteria?

12:05.641 --> 12:07.934
Boa constrictor.

12:11.981 --> 12:14.899
What on earth are you talking about?

12:14.942 --> 12:18.737
My behavior in the cafeteria
was delightful.

12:18.863 --> 12:21.990
Maybe your friend Gunderson needs
to head over to IKEA

12:22.032 --> 12:24.409
and assemble a sense of humor.

12:25.453 --> 12:28.705
You embarrassed me in front of
my colleagues on my first day here.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.041
Kitten in a teacup.

12:32.418 --> 12:33.668
Oh...

12:38.549 --> 12:40.884
- Embarrassed you?
- You know what?

12:41.051 --> 12:43.303
I don't have time for this.
Find another way home.

12:43.429 --> 12:46.306
I'm starting to get the sense
that you're angry with me.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.725
- Really? What tipped you off?
- Couple things, actually.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.101
Your tone of voice,
your body language...

12:50.186 --> 12:51.561
- Get out.
- Well, now, that.

12:54.023 --> 12:56.274
Woman giving birth.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.817
Oh!

13:05.493 --> 13:07.702
It's 9:00. Where you been?

13:07.787 --> 13:10.497
I had to take the bus home.

13:10.581 --> 13:13.833
Fell asleep and missed my stop.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.585
Oh, no.

13:15.628 --> 13:19.506
Did you know that Los Angeles has
a Little Sri Lanka?

13:19.548 --> 13:23.760
- I did not.
- Well, I do... now.

13:23.844 --> 13:27.055
They're a lovely people.

13:27.139 --> 13:30.099
Although terrifying when you wake up
face-to-face with them.

13:30.226 --> 13:34.521
If you're hungry, I brought home
some mutton in coconut milk.

13:34.605 --> 13:36.606
Why'd you get that?
You hate lamb.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.942
I was asking for directions.

13:39.109 --> 13:42.362
Apparently, there was
a communication problem.

13:42.488 --> 13:45.240
I thought Amy was gonna drive
you home.

13:45.282 --> 13:48.868
I thought so, too,
but she's acting very strangely.

13:48.953 --> 13:52.205
I was discussing it with a Sri Lankan
fellow on the bus,

13:52.289 --> 13:56.668
and he hypothesized that a tiger may
have recently run across her shadow.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.798
Although he may have just been trying
to drum up business

14:01.882 --> 14:05.301
for his brother-in-law's
witch doctor practice.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.806
Okay, Sheldon,
what happened between you and Amy?

14:09.849 --> 14:13.393
Well, can you believe she said
I embarrassed her?

14:13.435 --> 14:15.562
Yeah.

14:15.604 --> 14:18.231
But you didn't even hear the details.

14:19.191 --> 14:20.233
Sheldon...

14:22.152 --> 14:25.905
I've known you a long time,
and I'm going to tell you this

14:26.282 --> 14:28.908
with all the love
I can possibly muster.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.370
Amy's right. You're wrong.

14:33.747 --> 14:35.915
- But you don't even know...
- Doesn't matter.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.626
- But, now, but in my defense...
- Doesn't matter.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.795
You're not listening
to my side of it.

14:40.921 --> 14:43.089
Okay, fine, Sheldon.
What is your side?

14:44.091 --> 14:45.091
Well...

14:45.134 --> 14:47.468
Nope, got to go with Amy on this one.

14:52.933 --> 14:54.726
The shrimp was spicy.

14:54.810 --> 14:56.185
You want a TUMS?

14:56.270 --> 14:57.604
You got the tropical fruit kind?

14:57.688 --> 14:59.814
No, if I buy those,
I just go through them like candy.

14:59.940 --> 15:03.610
Tell me about it. One time, I swear
I pooped out a stick of chalk.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.156
- I'll get it.
- Thanks.

15:10.659 --> 15:12.535
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.662
I may have overreacted.

15:14.705 --> 15:18.458
Well, I didn't handle it
so great, either.

15:18.542 --> 15:21.169
It's just sometimes I feel like
you enjoy spending time

15:21.211 --> 15:22.795
with your friends more than with me.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.797
- That's not true.
- It's not?

15:24.882 --> 15:26.633
You spend all day together at work,

15:26.759 --> 15:28.551
and then you all hang out at night
playing games,

15:28.677 --> 15:30.219
going to the comic book store.

15:30.262 --> 15:32.555
Last week, you two got
a couples massage.

15:35.434 --> 15:38.144
So, when you said you wouldn't want
to spend that much time with me,

15:38.228 --> 15:40.772
it really hurt my feelings.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.151
I get that.
I'm so sorry.

15:45.277 --> 15:47.779
Starting tomorrow,
I am turning over a new leaf.

15:47.905 --> 15:50.531
Time with you is
my number one priority.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.327
Why tomorrow?

15:56.121 --> 16:00.166
Well, we're real close
to finishing off the new Batman game.

16:01.502 --> 16:04.337
It is awesome.

16:07.633 --> 16:08.954
You should probably go after her.

16:09.009 --> 16:11.010
Should I go after you?

16:11.136 --> 16:12.679
No!

16:14.556 --> 16:16.891
Thanks for getting me in trouble.

16:20.729 --> 16:25.066
Amy.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.988
Sheldon, what are you doing here
so late?

16:30.114 --> 16:32.365
I couldn't sleep
because I kept thinking

16:32.449 --> 16:34.117
about what happened
earlier between us.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.745
Also, I had one heck of a bus nap.

16:39.665 --> 16:43.543
Speaking of which, do you want
some mutton in coconut milk?

16:43.711 --> 16:47.547
- No.
- I cannot give this stuff away.

16:48.298 --> 16:49.924
What do you want?

16:49.967 --> 16:53.302
Amy, this isn't easy to say.

16:54.680 --> 16:58.141
All relationships are difficult,

16:58.225 --> 17:00.601
but even more so
when you're in one

17:00.769 --> 17:04.772
with a person who struggles
with everyday social interactions

17:04.815 --> 17:10.528
and, frankly, who can strike some
people as being kind of a weirdo.

17:10.612 --> 17:14.490
Sheldon...
you're not a weirdo.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.993
I wasn't speaking about me.

17:19.329 --> 17:22.999
I mean, honestly, there's no telling
what will set you off.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.002
You know, introducing myself
as your boyfriend.

17:26.086 --> 17:28.838
Giving you the opportunity
to drive me home.

17:28.922 --> 17:31.758
Breaking the ice with your colleagues
using ethnic humor,

17:31.884 --> 17:33.426
the funniest kind of humor.

17:35.929 --> 17:39.474
- What's your point?
- My point is, we're a couple.

17:39.558 --> 17:43.644
And...
I like you for who you are.

17:43.771 --> 17:44.896
Quirks and all.

17:47.441 --> 17:50.818
- I like you, too.
- Well, I should hope so.

17:51.695 --> 17:53.415
I don't see anyone else
banging on this door

17:53.489 --> 17:55.448
to put up with your nonsense.

18:00.162 --> 18:02.246
Not even a good-bye?

18:02.372 --> 18:05.708
You see, that's the kind of thing
that makes people think you're weird.

18:05.751 --> 18:06.959
Go away.

18:07.044 --> 18:08.961
Poor kid.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.464
She just doesn't see it.

18:16.261 --> 18:17.804
I'm not apologizing to Howard.

18:17.888 --> 18:19.764
He can come beg me on his knees.

18:19.890 --> 18:22.450
Sheldon, too. If I see him at work,
I'm just going to ignore him.

18:22.476 --> 18:24.352
All right, don't worry.
I talked to Leonard.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.938
He is gonna sit the guys down
and set them straight.

18:27.022 --> 18:29.232
Laser's warmed up.

18:29.733 --> 18:31.025
Pull!
