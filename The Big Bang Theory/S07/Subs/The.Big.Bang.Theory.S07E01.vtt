00:11.094 --> 00:14.930
Sheldon, it's not a great time!
What do you want?

00:15.098 --> 00:17.725
Hello to you, too.

00:18.643 --> 00:20.936
I'm sorry,
but this is important.

00:21.104 --> 00:22.646
What is it?

00:22.814 --> 00:27.276
Back to the Future 2 was in the
Back to the Future 3 case,

00:27.444 --> 00:29.945
and Back to the Future 3
was, get this,

00:30.113 --> 00:32.698
in the Back to the Future 2 case.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.283
So?

00:34.451 --> 00:39.329
So, did you do that,
or am I in the house with an intruder?

00:40.498 --> 00:45.085
Sheldon, I got to go inside.
It's getting rough out here.

00:46.713 --> 00:49.798
You're dodging the question.
I knew it was you.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.888
- What was that?
- What was what?

00:56.056 --> 00:57.556
This isn't a very good connection,

00:57.724 --> 01:00.684
but it sounded like someone
just released a Kraken.

01:02.353 --> 01:05.481
Okay, I'm hanging up now.

01:05.648 --> 01:07.191
You know there's
no such thing as a...

01:10.111 --> 01:11.820
No!

01:13.782 --> 01:16.617
Penny! Penny! Penny!

01:18.328 --> 01:19.620
What's the matter?

01:20.288 --> 01:21.747
Um...

01:21.956 --> 01:25.209
Well, I was worried
that you might be missing Leonard.

01:26.419 --> 01:29.963
And that might be causing
you to have bad dreams,

01:30.131 --> 01:32.412
like the kind you'd get if you
watched Clash of the Titans

01:32.550 --> 01:34.384
right before you went to bed.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.930
Sweetie, did you have a bad dream?

01:39.516 --> 01:41.517
- To be honest, I did.
- Aw.

01:41.726 --> 01:46.105
Back to the Future 2 was in the
Back to the Future 3 case.

01:46.272 --> 01:47.940
Leonard did it.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.442
- Good night.
- No, wait.

01:51.194 --> 01:56.281
Perhaps I should sleep here,
so you don't miss Leonard as much,

01:56.449 --> 01:59.243
'cause you're being
kind of a baby about it.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.250
You know what?
That would make me feel better.

02:06.417 --> 02:08.085
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.216
Good night.

02:41.744 --> 02:45.038
I think you'd be pleased to hear that
this morning in the parking garage,

02:45.206 --> 02:47.916
I saw this oil stain on the ground
that was shaped just like

02:48.084 --> 02:51.920
my ex-girlfriend, Lucy,
and I didn't get upset at all.

02:52.088 --> 02:54.089
I'm proud of you.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.884
Well, you should be,
'cause she was looking good.

02:57.594 --> 03:00.888
Dear Lord!
You're an astronomer.

03:01.055 --> 03:04.892
Although you may have earthly woes,
get your mind back on the stars.

03:05.059 --> 03:08.187
Gee, even the lowly dung beetle
chooses to plot its course

03:08.354 --> 03:10.647
- by using the Milky Way.
- Is that true?

03:10.815 --> 03:13.442
Everything I say is true.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.903
Now, of course,
the dung beetle also enjoys

03:16.070 --> 03:20.407
eating feces, living in feces
and making little balls out of feces.

03:20.575 --> 03:24.036
So, you know, pick and choose
which aspects of its lifestyle

03:24.204 --> 03:25.704
you want to embrace.

03:26.831 --> 03:28.790
Come on, you can talk to girls now.

03:28.958 --> 03:31.001
It shouldn't be hard for you
to meet someone new.

03:31.169 --> 03:34.838
How can I meet someone new when
everywhere I look, I see Lucy's face?

03:35.006 --> 03:38.884
Tell me you don't see her smile
in the crust of this chicken pot pie.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.512
Would you stop it!

03:45.808 --> 03:46.892
Now, listen to me.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.436
There's a welcome party
for incoming post-docs tonight.

03:49.604 --> 03:54.149
Go to it and meet someone
who isn't made of grease or pie.

03:54.317 --> 03:57.402
You think you're so cool
because your wife is a person?

04:01.157 --> 04:04.076
Look, Bernie's at a neuroscience
conference with Amy.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.085
- I'll go with you.
- You would do that for me?

04:06.204 --> 04:08.622
Of course. You're my friend.
I want you to be happy.

04:08.790 --> 04:09.831
Thanks.

04:10.041 --> 04:13.210
Oh, Sheldon, since Amy's out of town,
would you like to join us?

04:13.461 --> 04:15.379
I want you to be happy, too,

04:15.546 --> 04:18.048
but not enough
to do anything about it.

04:21.094 --> 04:26.390
Howie, stop. I can't talk like that.
Amy's right here.

04:26.557 --> 04:31.144
Sheldon, stop. For the last time,
I will not bring home bed bugs.

04:31.896 --> 04:34.898
The hotel's nice.
There's a pool, a gym,

04:35.066 --> 04:36.275
the bar looks like fun.

04:36.442 --> 04:40.112
Because I looked in the bed,
and there are no bugs.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.740
I love you, too. If I don't talk
to you before you go to sleep,

04:43.908 --> 04:46.994
- I'll meet you in dreamland.
- Good night.

04:47.912 --> 04:51.081
No, I will not consider sleeping
in my garment bag.

04:54.252 --> 04:57.504
Penny, did you ever wonder
how Starfleet captains...

04:57.672 --> 04:59.256
No.

05:01.592 --> 05:03.760
Well, now that
I've piqued your interest,

05:03.928 --> 05:07.389
welcome to the exciting world
of 3D chess.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.758
Why don't you just admit
you only want to play this game

05:09.892 --> 05:12.227
because you always play it
with Leonard and you miss him?

05:13.271 --> 05:15.897
You overestimate
his significance in my life.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.149
Hm...

05:17.400 --> 05:22.404
Do I miss how he makes a face
on my toaster waffle with syrup?

05:22.572 --> 05:23.864
No.

05:24.532 --> 05:28.660
Do I miss the way he fixes the zipper
on my jacket when it gets stuck?

05:28.828 --> 05:30.495
I don't think so.

05:31.247 --> 05:33.373
Do I miss how we say good night
to each other

05:33.541 --> 05:36.293
through the walls of our bedroom
using Morse Code?

05:41.341 --> 05:44.343
Okay, I get it, I get it.
You are an emotionless robot.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.428
Well, I try.

05:46.971 --> 05:49.431
All right, let's just get
this stupid game over with.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.516
- Great. I'll go first.
- Okay.

05:51.684 --> 05:52.976
By the way, how are you with zippers?

05:53.144 --> 05:54.353
- Why?
- Well, I really need

05:54.520 --> 05:57.773
to go to the bathroom,
and this one's gone all cattywampus.

06:00.985 --> 06:05.197
Wow, your work on jellyfish
neural nets sounds so interesting.

06:05.365 --> 06:08.909
It is. You can download my paper
off the university server.

06:09.077 --> 06:12.287
I will. You can download my paper
on the Van Allen Belts

06:12.455 --> 06:15.457
- from the university server as well.
- I will.

06:17.752 --> 06:18.752
All right.

06:33.935 --> 06:34.976
How'd it go?

06:35.144 --> 06:36.978
Well, if you like dry,
factual statements

06:37.146 --> 06:40.649
interspersed with painful moments
of silence, it was bananas.

06:42.485 --> 06:45.112
Check it out. Mrs. Davis
from Human Resources is here.

06:45.279 --> 06:47.864
She's probably on the lookout
for sexual harassment.

06:48.032 --> 06:51.952
Oh, great. There go my chances
of being sexually harassed.

06:52.912 --> 06:56.623
I heard her husband left her
for a hot, young undergrad.

06:56.791 --> 06:59.376
That's so much better
than the old, ugly ones.

07:04.715 --> 07:06.675
Mr. Wolowitz, Dr. Koothrappali.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.386
Mrs. Davis, nice to see you.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.888
You know, I recently read
a fascinating article

07:12.056 --> 07:17.060
- on infidelity among penguins.
- Okay.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.938
So if the fact
that your husband left you

07:20.106 --> 07:23.191
makes you feel unattractive, just
remember, penguins get cheated on,

07:23.359 --> 07:24.526
and they're adorable.

07:37.665 --> 07:40.375
It was better when you
couldn't talk to women.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.671
I was thinking of going
to the lecture

07:44.839 --> 07:46.673
on posterior cingulate
cortex lesions

07:46.841 --> 07:48.717
in the formation
of autobiographical memory.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.844
Oh, brain lesions are fascinating.

07:51.012 --> 07:53.805
Unless they're yours,
then they're a drag.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.383
To the advancement of science.

07:56.517 --> 07:59.311
And to the sick and dying
who make it possible.

08:01.647 --> 08:04.691
This is fun. We never really get
to talk shop with Penny around.

08:04.859 --> 08:06.499
We usually just end up
talking about boys.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.904
Which is fine,
but it's nice to mix it up

08:09.071 --> 08:10.655
with a little
intellectual conversation.

08:10.823 --> 08:13.283
From the two gentlemen at the bar.

08:13.451 --> 08:16.286
Oh, my gosh, boys bought us drinks!
Boys bought us drinks!

08:17.747 --> 08:19.331
Thank you, thank you,
thank you so much.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.126
- Be cool.
- You be cool!

08:23.294 --> 08:26.505
Guys are hitting on us,
and not just to get to Penny.

08:27.256 --> 08:30.300
You're right. Thank you!

08:34.805 --> 08:38.767
- Oh! Bad move.
- Really? Why?

08:38.935 --> 08:41.937
My queen can now
take your rook from below.

08:42.730 --> 08:45.815
So that means I lose, right?
It's over!

08:47.026 --> 08:49.236
If I make this move...

08:49.904 --> 08:52.489
But I won't because
we're having too much fun.

08:54.867 --> 08:59.162
- Okay, let's take a break.
- We're all out of alcohol.

08:59.330 --> 09:00.914
I wasn't going to get alcohol.

09:08.005 --> 09:11.341
Gosh, I wonder what Leonard's doing
right now. I miss him so much.

09:11.509 --> 09:14.886
Well, if you'd like,
we could call him.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.555
I mean that you could call him.

09:16.722 --> 09:20.475
As I've explained, the absence
of my friends does not cause me pain.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.644
As rock and roll bad boy Paul Simon
once said,

09:22.812 --> 09:26.731
"I am a rock. I am an iiiisland."

09:28.109 --> 09:30.402
- I'm calling him.
- Oh, goodie! Put him on speakerphone!

09:39.495 --> 09:41.997
Excuse me, ladies,
but my pants are buzzing.

09:44.584 --> 09:48.003
North Sea, how can I "kelp" you?

09:48.921 --> 09:50.964
- Leonard?
- Penny?

09:51.132 --> 09:53.258
Hey, it's Penny.
Everybody say "Hi" to Penny.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.093
Hi, Penny!

09:56.262 --> 09:58.597
Ha! Sounds like you're
having a good time.

09:58.764 --> 10:01.349
Best time of my life!

10:03.352 --> 10:07.314
- Isn't it 5:30 in the morning there?
- Is it?

10:07.481 --> 10:10.734
Hey, everybody,
it's 5:30 in the morning!

10:13.821 --> 10:17.032
Okay, well, we were just calling you
because we were missing you.

10:17.199 --> 10:19.367
- Iceberg!
- Oh! Hang on.

10:19.535 --> 10:22.704
- Are you in danger?
- No, it's a drinking game.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.540
Whenever we see an iceberg,
we take a shot!

10:25.708 --> 10:29.002
Berg! Berg!
Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg!

10:29.920 --> 10:33.131
Leonard? Leonard?

10:34.383 --> 10:36.926
I cannot believe we
were missing that jerk.

10:37.845 --> 10:39.679
You were.

10:44.769 --> 10:46.394
So what happened?
How'd it go?

10:46.562 --> 10:49.105
It's fine. I thanked them again and
let them know we're not available.

10:49.273 --> 10:53.234
So I can drink this without having
to give up the goodies?

10:53.402 --> 10:55.654
Yes, it's all cool.

10:55.821 --> 10:59.741
Although, if you wanted to talk to
one of them, no one would blame you.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.368
And why would no one blame me?

11:03.329 --> 11:05.747
I don't know what I'm saying.

11:05.915 --> 11:09.959
Well, it sounds like you're saying
that I could do better than Sheldon.

11:10.127 --> 11:12.253
Boy, these drinks are strong!

11:13.964 --> 11:17.967
Oh, Mama, I'm gonna be
hugging the toilet tonight!

11:20.096 --> 11:22.597
No, tell me. I want to know
what you meant by that.

11:24.934 --> 11:27.102
I just meant that you're not married,

11:27.269 --> 11:31.272
and your boyfriend's
kind of... Sheldon.

11:32.441 --> 11:36.611
And your husband is extremely Howard.
What's your point?

11:37.947 --> 11:41.408
Sorry, I have no point.
That was a stupid thing to say.

11:41.575 --> 11:43.535
Can we please just go back
to having a nice time?

11:43.703 --> 11:47.080
We could, but unfortunately
my brain is lesion-free

11:47.248 --> 11:50.834
and I remember that rotten thing
you just said about my sweet baboo.

11:51.001 --> 11:53.837
Come on, I apologize.
Can we please just let it go?

11:55.506 --> 11:57.132
- Sure.
- Thanks.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.845
Your husband's weird
and his clothes are ridiculous.

12:04.432 --> 12:07.058
I can't believe it! All this time
I've been doing nothing

12:07.226 --> 12:10.019
but sit around and miss that guy.
And you know what the worst part is?

12:10.187 --> 12:15.024
That you're having to process
your emotional pain without vodka?

12:19.447 --> 12:20.905
No.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.991
Yeah.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.536
But you know what
the second-worst part is?

12:26.704 --> 12:30.999
- He does not miss me at all.
- Allow me to comfort you.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.668
At least you've got your health.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.798
Really? That's it?
That's comforting?

12:39.717 --> 12:41.050
Um...

12:41.260 --> 12:46.014
In a hundred years, you'll both
be dead and it won't matter?

12:47.516 --> 12:50.894
No! Come on! You're supposed to say,
"Of course he misses you.

12:51.061 --> 12:53.813
The only reason he's partying
is to cover up his pain."

12:53.981 --> 12:56.399
Oh, no, I don't think
that's true at all.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.403
This is ridiculous.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.947
Why am I upset just because
he's off having a good time?

13:03.115 --> 13:07.702
Well, perhaps you're
obsessively picturing him

13:07.870 --> 13:11.331
engaged in drunken coitus
with another woman.

13:14.835 --> 13:17.378
Is that it?
Did I get it right?

13:19.590 --> 13:22.342
Okay, that's great. You can stop
trying to make me feel better now.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.052
Actually, I can't.

13:24.220 --> 13:27.555
Before Leonard left, he made me
promise that I'd take care of you.

13:27.723 --> 13:30.141
- He did?
- Yes.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.727
Oh! That's really sweet.

13:32.895 --> 13:36.731
Plus, if I do a good job, he said
he'd bring me back a sailor's cap.

13:39.276 --> 13:41.152
Well, now I miss him even more.

13:41.320 --> 13:45.949
Well, if it's any consolation,
I'm sure Leonard's tormented

13:46.116 --> 13:51.079
every moment he's away from your
warm embrace and cherry lips.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.375
- Thanks.
- Oh! Seriously?

13:59.129 --> 14:01.881
- Excuse me, Mrs. Davis?
- What?

14:02.049 --> 14:04.926
I'd like to apologize
for being insensitive.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.263
And for possibly making penguins
seem like jerks,

14:08.430 --> 14:11.599
because 99 percent of them
are stand-up guys.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.018
Forget about it.

14:16.272 --> 14:18.606
You know, you and I...
you and I have a lot in common.

14:18.774 --> 14:20.733
- Is that right?
- Oh, yes. I...

14:20.901 --> 14:23.528
I, too,
am in the throes of heartbreak.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.282
Okay, fine,
I'll tell you about it.

14:29.034 --> 14:32.787
Here is a hot beverage
to comfort you.

14:33.747 --> 14:37.375
It's in a to-go cup.
Make of that what you will.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.006
Come on. It's still early.
Let's do something.

14:44.133 --> 14:48.553
Well, I have been toying around
with an idea for 4D chess.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.931
- How about we just talk?
- All right.

14:52.099 --> 14:53.558
- In 4D chess...
- No.

14:55.603 --> 14:57.312
Come on, let's talk about our lives.

14:57.479 --> 14:59.314
Tell me something
about you I don't know.

15:03.152 --> 15:05.695
I own nine pairs of pants.

15:08.365 --> 15:10.074
Okay, that's a good start,

15:10.242 --> 15:12.327
but I was thinking maybe something
a little more personal.

15:12.494 --> 15:14.120
- I see.
- Hm.

15:15.706 --> 15:19.042
I own nine pairs of underpants.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.171
How about I go first?

15:23.339 --> 15:26.841
But I don't want to know
how many underpants you own.

15:27.009 --> 15:30.136
Although, based on the floor of your
bedroom, I'd say it's a thousand.

15:30.304 --> 15:34.349
Okay, look, here's something
people do not know about me.

15:34.516 --> 15:36.434
When I first moved out to LA,

15:36.602 --> 15:39.062
I did a topless scene
in a low-budget horror movie

15:39.229 --> 15:41.356
about a killer gorilla.

15:41.523 --> 15:43.107
After I did it,
I felt so ashamed.

15:43.275 --> 15:46.194
Thankfully,
that thing never came out.

15:46.362 --> 15:48.404
I've seen that.

15:49.573 --> 15:52.617
- Yeah. Serial Apeist.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.996
Howard found it online
the day we met you.

15:57.164 --> 15:59.666
- Oh, God.
- I mean, it was literally

15:59.833 --> 16:01.459
the moment you walked out the door.

16:04.004 --> 16:07.715
But I see the type of personal
revelations you're going for.

16:08.717 --> 16:11.552
Okay, here's one I thought
I'd take to the grave.

16:11.720 --> 16:12.929
Okay.

16:15.557 --> 16:19.477
A while back,
YouTube changed its user interface

16:19.645 --> 16:24.691
from a star-based rating system
to a thumbs-up rating system.

16:24.858 --> 16:29.153
I tell people I'm okay with it,
but I'm really not.

16:34.535 --> 16:38.037
- That's your big revelation?
- Yes.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.040
Whoo! I feel ten pounds lighter.

16:42.584 --> 16:45.753
Okay, you know what?
I give up. I'm going to bed.

16:47.297 --> 16:49.298
Here's something else
you don't know about me:

16:49.466 --> 16:52.635
- you just hurt my feelings.
- What did I do?

16:52.803 --> 16:56.014
I opened up and shared something
deeply upsetting to me,

16:56.181 --> 16:58.141
and you treated it
as if it were nothing.

16:59.643 --> 17:03.646
- I didn't think it was a big deal.
- It is to me, that's the point.

17:06.650 --> 17:09.110
Sheldon, you are right.
I'm really sorry.

17:09.278 --> 17:12.947
- I should've known better.
- Your apology is accepted.

17:13.115 --> 17:16.325
Thank you. How about a hug?

17:16.493 --> 17:19.078
- How about a hearty handshake?
- Come on.

17:23.125 --> 17:27.879
Now I know how you felt getting
mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.688
- Good night.
- Mm-hm.

17:52.654 --> 17:55.698
It was rather flattering
to have strangers send us drinks.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.034
Yeah, that felt nice.

18:00.037 --> 18:03.164
Maybe tomorrow morning
we put on some hot pants

18:03.332 --> 18:06.000
and see if we can score us
some free omelets.

18:08.879 --> 18:12.632
So, hypothetically, if we
were to have gone with them,

18:12.800 --> 18:14.080
which one would you have picked?

18:17.304 --> 18:19.985
I think I would have gone with the
short one with the goofy haircut.

18:20.015 --> 18:22.433
Oh, good, 'cause I liked
the tall thin one.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.644
He seemed intelligent,
kind of a loner,

18:24.812 --> 18:27.021
maybe a little sexually
inexperienced,

18:27.189 --> 18:29.732
like I'd have
to teach him a thing or two.

18:32.027 --> 18:35.613
Not my guy.
I caught him staring at my rack.

18:36.740 --> 18:37.900
It'd be nice to be with a man

18:37.908 --> 18:40.701
who wants to know
what's underneath my cardigan.

18:41.745 --> 18:44.330
FYI, it's another cardigan.

18:46.708 --> 18:49.836
Your short, sexed-up guy
kind of sounds like Howard.

18:50.003 --> 18:53.089
Your brainy virgin
kind of sounds like Sheldon.

18:54.174 --> 18:56.050
- Good night.
- Night.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.973
All right, Dr. Koothrappali,
it's been nice talking to you,

19:02.141 --> 19:04.021
but I need to go home
and relieve my babysitter.

19:04.101 --> 19:08.146
I can relate to being
a single parent. I have a dog.

19:08.313 --> 19:12.316
Yeah, it's exactly the same thing.
Good night.

19:12.484 --> 19:13.860
Mrs. Davis...

19:14.027 --> 19:17.905
I, uh... I must confess,
I came here tonight

19:18.073 --> 19:20.908
in a futile attempt
to pick up some lonely post-doc,

19:21.076 --> 19:24.996
but instead I got to connect
with you at a human level.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.748
That's a much better evening.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.710
You're a lovely person.

19:30.878 --> 19:34.755
- Are you hitting on me?
- No, no, no, that would be crazy!

19:34.923 --> 19:36.465
I mean, if I were hitting on you,
you'd know it

19:36.633 --> 19:39.385
'cause you'd feel uncomfortable
and a little sad for me.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.557
You're sweet.

19:45.851 --> 19:49.645
- Good night, Dr. Koothrappali.
- Good night.

19:51.648 --> 19:53.399
Looks like she accepted your apology.

19:53.567 --> 19:57.278
And then some.
I think we had a moment.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.906
Please, you did not
have a moment.

20:00.073 --> 20:01.949
Who died and made you
king of moments?

20:04.620 --> 20:07.038
Okay, fine.
Let's say there was a moment.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.957
- There was.
- There wasn't. But...

20:10.125 --> 20:13.044
But even if there was,
what are you gonna do about it?

20:13.212 --> 20:18.925
I will slowly seduce her
until she falls helpless into my bed,

20:19.092 --> 20:20.927
hungry for the pleasure
only I can give her.

20:21.094 --> 20:22.720
- So nothing.
- No, not a thing.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.438
I'm so glad the police
finally caught

20:32.606 --> 20:36.484
that psychotic
genetically-engineered ape.

20:41.365 --> 20:44.158
That is my girlfriend!
I swear to God!

20:45.035 --> 20:48.412
Leonard! Leonard!
Leonard! Leonard!
