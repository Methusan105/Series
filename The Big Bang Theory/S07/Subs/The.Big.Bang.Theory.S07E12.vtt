WEBVTT

00:16.766 --> 00:18.809
This is nice,
that we all get to eat together.

00:19.644 --> 00:20.644
Absolutely.

00:27.068 --> 00:30.821
Can we maybe put the phones down and
have an actual human conversation?

00:30.989 --> 00:35.200
We can, but thanks to Steve Jobs,
we don't have to.

00:36.661 --> 00:38.620
Guys. Guys,
you're never gonna believe this.

00:38.788 --> 00:40.956
- What happened?
- I just got a part on a TV show!

00:41.124 --> 00:42.458
- That's great!
- Congratulations!

00:42.625 --> 00:44.835
- Guys!
- Oh, yeah!

00:45.003 --> 00:48.380
- Yay, Penny!
- What's the show?

00:48.548 --> 00:53.010
NCII, or, you know, NCSTD...

00:53.178 --> 00:54.720
I don't know, it's...

00:54.888 --> 00:57.514
It's the one with all the letters
and I'm gonna be on it!

00:57.682 --> 00:59.475
- That's amazing!
- Yeah.

00:59.642 --> 01:01.977
- What's your part?
- I play a customer in a diner

01:02.145 --> 01:03.854
and I flirt with Mark Harmon.

01:04.022 --> 01:07.191
Ooh, Mark Harmon,
he's a dreamboat.

01:08.818 --> 01:11.111
- So it's just flirting?
- Well, yeah. Why?

01:11.279 --> 01:12.946
No reason. I just think it's sexier

01:13.114 --> 01:14.675
when things are left
to the imagination.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.244
He's wrong.

01:45.313 --> 01:47.815
So I read a study that
says a man with a dog

01:47.982 --> 01:50.275
is three times more likely
to get a woman's phone number.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.402
Is it true even when
the man lets his dog

01:52.570 --> 01:54.905
lick peanut butter off his tongue?

01:55.073 --> 01:57.282
I don't see why not.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.221
If you're really desperate
to meet women

02:00.286 --> 02:02.371
and like having food
eaten out of your mouth,

02:02.539 --> 02:04.498
I could set you up with my mom.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.668
Why is that funny?

02:09.003 --> 02:10.796
That's just unhygienic.

02:12.048 --> 02:14.716
- It's a joke.
- I don't think so.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.595
I believe that a joke
is a brief oral narrative

02:18.763 --> 02:21.056
with a climactic humorous twist.

02:21.224 --> 02:24.143
For example,
Wolowitz's mother is so fat

02:24.310 --> 02:26.395
that she decided
to go on a diet,

02:26.563 --> 02:29.356
or exercise, or both.

02:31.734 --> 02:36.947
See? The twist is that people
don't usually change.

02:39.784 --> 02:41.618
Well, they don't.

02:42.787 --> 02:45.706
Hey, guys, don't forget,
my episode's on TV tomorrow night.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.166
- We'll be there.
- Can we bring anything?

02:47.333 --> 02:49.626
Oh, that's so sweet of you,
but I was gonna steal food from here.

02:49.794 --> 02:52.212
You know, my treat.

02:53.214 --> 02:57.384
Wait, if Howard's mother is coming,
then you should also steal marbles.

03:01.222 --> 03:03.974
Because she's obese,
and hippos are obese,

03:04.142 --> 03:08.020
and in the popular board game Hungry
Hungry Hippos, they eat marbles.

03:12.942 --> 03:15.360
Maybe I need to dumb
these down for you.

03:18.198 --> 03:21.742
- Leonard, do you think I'm funny?
- No.

03:24.954 --> 03:28.457
- Do you?
- I think I'm hysterical.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.878
I take it back.
That was funny.

03:34.422 --> 03:37.716
The philosopher Henri Bergson
says it's funny

03:37.884 --> 03:40.636
when a human being
behaves like an object.

03:40.803 --> 03:44.139
I bet that bit killed
at The Chuckle Hut.

03:45.475 --> 03:49.186
Oh, he didn't perform stand-up
comedy, he was a philosopher.

03:51.147 --> 03:54.149
You know, I think
we're zeroing in on your problem.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.985
Perhaps I'll spend some time

03:57.153 --> 03:59.446
developing a unified
theory of comedy,

03:59.614 --> 04:03.200
which will allow me to elicit
laughter from anyone at any time.

04:03.368 --> 04:06.745
Unless they're German,
'cause that's a tough crowd.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.250
Are you set on people
laughing with you?

04:11.417 --> 04:14.211
'Cause if you're cool with at you...

04:20.218 --> 04:22.344
I don't get it.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.564
Raj, when you said you
were gonna bring a date

04:25.682 --> 04:28.202
to watch Penny's thing tonight,
I didn't think you meant Stuart.

04:30.853 --> 04:35.399
Really? I never for a second
thought it'd be anything else.

04:35.566 --> 04:38.068
I almost met someone last night,
but I blew it.

04:38.236 --> 04:41.321
I was walking Cinnamon
and this girl introduced herself,

04:41.489 --> 04:44.241
but she was so cute I panicked
and said,

04:44.409 --> 04:46.159
"Wouldn't it be easier
if instead of talking

04:46.327 --> 04:48.078
we could just sniff
each other's butts?"

04:50.164 --> 04:52.165
Well, Stuart's cute in his own way.

04:52.333 --> 04:55.544
When I was a baby, my mother
called me her little possum.

04:55.712 --> 04:59.339
- Are possums cute?
- Not at all.

05:00.550 --> 05:03.385
If you're so intimidated
by talking to attractive girls,

05:03.553 --> 05:06.263
maybe you should practice
by talking to regular people.

05:06.431 --> 05:09.308
You mean like fatties and uggos?

05:10.727 --> 05:12.769
Or maybe just stop talking.

05:12.937 --> 05:17.190
I'm serious. Go to the mall,
talk to anybody, practice.

05:17.358 --> 05:18.942
That way, when you eventually
do talk to a cute girl,

05:19.110 --> 05:22.904
- it won't be so scary.
- Or just keep dating the possum.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.703
Parsa doesn't haVe
those kind of resources.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.331
No, and that's why he had
Erin Pace rewire it...

05:32.498 --> 05:33.498
I'm so proud of you.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.417
We haven't even
gotten to my scene yet.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.836
I know, but you're going to be a TV
star and you haven't left me yet.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.713
That takes guts.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.134
I don't know about you, but I'm
very uncomfortable with all this.

05:44.302 --> 05:47.262
- Why?
- I've never seen this show before

05:47.430 --> 05:49.931
and now I'm starting
with episode 246?

05:52.060 --> 05:54.144
It's unnatural.

05:54.312 --> 05:58.523
Just think of the first 245
as the prequel.

05:58.691 --> 06:00.484
All right.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.612
Okay, shh.
Guys, guys, this is it.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.655
I guess it's you and me, kid.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.117
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to make peace.

06:09.285 --> 06:10.452
- We're good.
- Good.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.330
- Are you kidding me?
- What's wrong?

06:13.498 --> 06:16.917
Well, the diner scene.
Where's my diner scene?

06:17.085 --> 06:19.961
Don't ask me. Until I see
the prequel, I'm lost.

06:20.838 --> 06:23.131
No, there was supposed to be
a big scene with me and Mark Harmon,

06:23.299 --> 06:25.092
but it's... gone.

06:25.259 --> 06:28.387
- What happened?
- They must've cut it.

06:28.554 --> 06:30.931
Oh, Penny.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.100
I'm... I'm sorry.

06:33.267 --> 06:34.868
- That stinks.
- I'm sure you were great.

06:34.936 --> 06:37.562
This doesn't make any sense.
I mean, I...

06:37.730 --> 06:39.815
I thought I did
a really good job, I...

06:42.318 --> 06:43.860
Excuse me.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.827
I've been studying how
to make people laugh.

06:54.831 --> 06:59.709
They say that comedy
is tragedy plus time.

07:00.962 --> 07:03.505
- Let's tickle some ribs.
- No!

07:07.301 --> 07:09.845
No, Dad, I don't think they
cut me out of the show

07:10.012 --> 07:12.222
because I was too pretty.

07:13.933 --> 07:17.894
No, I don't need you to come out
and kick Mark Harmon's ass.

07:20.022 --> 07:22.816
Daddy, I gotta go.
I love you. Bye.

07:24.110 --> 07:27.070
- How you doing?
- This is such a disaster.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.531
My parents had all my relatives over.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.284
They got one of those
six-foot sandwiches,

07:32.452 --> 07:35.537
and got my brother
a day pass out of rehab and...

07:36.998 --> 07:40.500
...now he's missing
and the sandwich is missing, and...

07:40.668 --> 07:45.005
They're probably in Mexico by now.
So humiliating.

07:45.173 --> 07:48.592
You still got the part.
That's a huge accomplishment.

07:48.759 --> 07:49.843
But this was supposed
to be my break, okay?

07:50.011 --> 07:51.219
People were gonna
see me in this show

07:51.387 --> 07:52.429
and it was gonna
lead to bigger things.

07:52.597 --> 07:55.432
More auditions, more parts.
Now none of that's gonna happen.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.351
Honey, you only had three lines.
That wasn't gonna happen anyway.

08:02.732 --> 08:05.525
- Unbelievable.
- Oh, come on.

08:05.693 --> 08:08.069
- That's not what I meant.
- Then what did you mean?

08:08.237 --> 08:11.740
I don't... You know, words don't
always have to mean things.

08:11.908 --> 08:14.451
I think you meant
that you don't believe in me.

08:14.619 --> 08:17.871
Nope. Uh-uh. I might not
know what I meant,

08:18.039 --> 08:19.748
but I know that
I didn't mean that.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.000
Not this guy. Oh, no way.

08:22.168 --> 08:25.962
I want you, right now, to give me
your 100 percent honest opinion.

08:26.130 --> 08:29.841
Do you think I have what it takes
to really make it as an actress?

08:30.009 --> 08:31.593
- Yes.
- So you think I'll be on TV

08:31.761 --> 08:33.303
and in movies and win awards.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.013
- Honestly?
- Yes, honestly.

08:36.557 --> 08:40.060
- I don't.
- How could you say that?

08:40.228 --> 08:43.188
I don't know... I got all confused
when you said "honestly."

08:43.356 --> 08:44.940
Oh!

08:46.984 --> 08:49.277
Look, do I think
that you are talented

08:49.445 --> 08:51.655
and that you are beautiful?
Of course I do.

08:51.822 --> 08:53.990
But isn't Los Angeles
full of actresses

08:54.158 --> 08:57.619
who are just as talented,
just as beautiful?

08:57.787 --> 09:00.080
Look, we'll come back to that.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.790
No, please. Don't stop, go on.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.318
Tell me how I'm gonna be a waitress
for the rest of my life.

09:04.377 --> 09:08.088
That is not what I said.
Look, I think you're really good.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.965
I truly do.

09:10.132 --> 09:12.592
But this is an incredibly hard thing
that you're shooting for.

09:12.760 --> 09:16.012
I mean, the odds of anyone
becoming a successful actor

09:16.180 --> 09:19.933
- are like a million to one.
- Wow, thank you.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.776
Should've let Sheldon come.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.657
This is interesting.

09:35.825 --> 09:39.327
Apparently, a key component
in some forms of humor

09:39.495 --> 09:43.081
- is the element of surprise.
- Well, that makes sense.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.584
The prefrontal cortex
is responsible

09:45.751 --> 09:47.669
for planning and anticipation,

09:47.837 --> 09:50.005
- and patients with brain lesions...
- Brain lesions!

09:56.846 --> 09:59.306
Sheldon, you scared me.
That wasn't funny.

09:59.473 --> 10:02.517
Or maybe you have a stick
up your prefrontal cortex.

10:04.478 --> 10:07.856
Okay, the notion that you can
read a few books and come up

10:08.024 --> 10:10.609
with a definitive theory
of comedy is absurd.

10:10.776 --> 10:14.821
I mean, humor is
a complex neurological...

10:19.368 --> 10:22.537
- Okay, that's pretty good.
- Excellent.

10:29.837 --> 10:33.798
- How about her?
- No! No pretty girls!

10:33.966 --> 10:35.717
The point is to talk
to regular people

10:35.885 --> 10:37.469
and work our way up
to pretty girls.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.054
Fine.

10:40.014 --> 10:43.058
How about that old lady
with the walker?

10:43.225 --> 10:47.520
That depends. On any level,
do you think she's hot?

10:48.814 --> 10:50.732
We'll find somebody else.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.362
Kumquat?

10:57.782 --> 10:59.366
I guess.

11:01.827 --> 11:03.453
Ointment?

11:05.206 --> 11:06.748
Sure.

11:07.625 --> 11:10.126
Now, would you say ointment

11:10.294 --> 11:14.756
is more, equal to,
or less funny than kumquat?

11:17.093 --> 11:19.928
I don't think I want
to go out with you anymore.

11:20.846 --> 11:24.265
Would you please stop joking around?
I'm trying to figure this out.

11:24.433 --> 11:27.185
Sheldon, how many words
are you gonna go through?

11:27.353 --> 11:28.937
All of them.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.775
You didn't get your part cut.

11:35.903 --> 11:38.738
And you didn't get your part cut.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.784
Yep, bunch of old guys
rocking out in a band,

11:42.952 --> 11:46.329
all with erectile dysfunction,
you didn't get your part cut!

11:50.251 --> 11:52.168
Hey. Can we talk?

11:52.336 --> 11:55.839
We can, but the part
of Penny might get cut.

11:58.134 --> 12:00.135
That was really crappy of me.

12:01.303 --> 12:04.639
What you're trying to do is hard,
but people do make it,

12:04.807 --> 12:08.184
and I really do believe
you could be one of them.

12:08.352 --> 12:10.979
Thank you.

12:11.147 --> 12:14.941
And... to show you how much
I believe in you,

12:15.109 --> 12:17.736
I kind of got you an audition.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.487
Are you serious? For what?

12:19.655 --> 12:21.740
- The new Star Wars movie.
- What?!

12:21.907 --> 12:25.243
- How did you manage that?
- There's this thing online,

12:25.411 --> 12:28.496
you put yourself on tape and just
send it in, anyone can do it.

12:30.624 --> 12:32.834
Come on, Leonard,
this is just a PR stunt.

12:33.002 --> 12:36.087
So? Even if it is,
you have a huge advantage

12:36.255 --> 12:37.797
because you're an actual actress.

12:37.965 --> 12:40.633
Most of the people doing this
are just weirdoes and nerds.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.263
Wolowitz sent his in two days ago.

12:46.348 --> 12:49.267
- Really, let it go.
- Look, maybe it is a long shot,

12:49.435 --> 12:51.519
but sometimes long shots happen.

12:51.687 --> 12:55.148
Luke Skywalker was only given one
chance to destroy the Death Star.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.817
He had to get a torpedo
into an exhaust port

12:57.985 --> 13:01.446
that was only two meters wide,
but with the help of The Force, he...

13:01.614 --> 13:04.657
Wow, I can feel you
hating me right now.

13:08.370 --> 13:11.122
How about that lady
in the sweat suit, speed-walking?

13:11.290 --> 13:13.792
Yeah, she seems friendly
and easy to...

13:13.959 --> 13:15.710
Never mind, she's gone.

13:16.921 --> 13:20.381
Maybe talking
to people is too hard.

13:21.425 --> 13:25.386
We could go over to that department
store, practice on the mannequins.

13:25.554 --> 13:27.388
I don't know.
They're dressed very stylishly.

13:27.556 --> 13:29.599
They're probably stuck-up.

13:32.019 --> 13:33.478
This is ridiculous.

13:33.646 --> 13:37.816
The next person that walks by,
no matter who it is, they're the one.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.905
We're gonna die here.

13:46.492 --> 13:47.742
- Hello.
- Hey.

13:47.910 --> 13:51.371
- Where's Sheldon?
- He's home trying to use science

13:51.539 --> 13:53.248
to determine the basis of humor.

13:53.415 --> 13:55.458
- That's interesting.
- It's exhausting.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.168
Do you have any idea how hard it is

13:57.336 --> 13:59.546
to laugh at a knock-knock
joke that starts with,

13:59.713 --> 14:01.089
"Knock-knock-knock, Amy,
knock-knock-knock, Amy,

14:01.257 --> 14:02.882
knock-knock-knock, Amy"?

14:04.093 --> 14:05.176
If you want him to stop,

14:05.344 --> 14:08.012
sometimes the easiest thing
to do is just fake a laugh.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.306
Fake a laugh?

14:12.268 --> 14:17.021
- Do you ever do that with me?
- No, of course not.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.482
Well, I'd be able to tell anyway.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.860
I don't think you would.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.320
Please, I've made
plenty of girls laugh,

14:24.488 --> 14:26.739
sometimes just by
asking them out.

14:59.106 --> 15:01.566
Yeah? Well, I fake my orgasms.

15:03.736 --> 15:08.907
Yes, how much for a hundred
long-stemmed, red roses?

15:09.074 --> 15:10.617
Really?

15:10.784 --> 15:13.119
How much for three?

15:15.998 --> 15:18.416
- Hey.
- Yeah, I'll call you back.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.420
Look, I know you were
just trying to help

15:22.588 --> 15:25.882
with your Star Wars thing.
I didn't mean to call it idiotic.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.259
Well, I don't think
you called it idiotic.

15:28.427 --> 15:31.137
Oh. Sorry, I meant to.

15:33.307 --> 15:38.686
Anyway... I was just upset
with myself. I wasn't mad at you.

15:38.854 --> 15:41.981
I just feel like everything
is falling apart.

15:42.149 --> 15:44.651
- Come on. It's okay.
- No, it's not okay!

15:44.818 --> 15:48.196
Look at me, okay? I took a temp job
as a waitress forever ago,

15:48.364 --> 15:51.115
and I'm still doing it.
I can't quit, because guess what?

15:51.283 --> 15:52.533
I can't do anything else.

15:52.701 --> 15:57.205
And I finally get my big break,
and it goes away! I'm such a mess.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.873
- No, you're not.
- Really?

15:59.041 --> 16:00.362
'Cause this morning at Starbucks,

16:00.376 --> 16:03.503
a pair of old underwear
fell out of my pant leg!

16:05.714 --> 16:08.341
And it wasn't the only
one in there.

16:10.010 --> 16:13.554
Okay, listen to me,
this is just a minor setback.

16:13.722 --> 16:16.307
No, it's not, okay? I've been out
here for, like, ten years!

16:16.475 --> 16:19.894
- I've nothing to show for it!
- Well, you have me.

16:21.230 --> 16:23.398
You're right.

16:24.316 --> 16:25.483
I do have you.

16:26.819 --> 16:27.944
Mmm.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.072
Let's get married.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.075
What?

16:37.746 --> 16:39.205
Whoo.

16:40.833 --> 16:44.377
Leonard Hofstadter,
will you marry me?

16:45.754 --> 16:47.547
Um...

16:49.591 --> 16:52.468
Did you seriously
just say, "Um"?

16:53.303 --> 16:56.556
Look, you know I love you,

16:56.724 --> 17:00.143
but you're... you're drunk
and sad and feeling lost...

17:00.310 --> 17:02.979
Okay, so you don't
want to marry me?!

17:03.147 --> 17:05.023
- That is not what I said.
- No, forget it! I take it back!

17:05.190 --> 17:09.110
- Offer's off the table!
- Who's in the mood to laugh?!

17:11.572 --> 17:12.655
Really not a good time.

17:12.823 --> 17:15.408
But I used science
to construct the perfect joke.

17:15.576 --> 17:17.118
- I'm gonna go.
- Penny, don't.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.287
No, no, I just need to be alone.

17:23.667 --> 17:27.628
So, a sandwich, a rabbi
and yo mama walk into a bar.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.214
- Where are you going?
- To my room.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.967
- Should I follow you?
- No.

17:33.135 --> 17:35.386
- Leonard, wait.
- What?

17:35.554 --> 17:38.598
I forgot to tell you
the sandwich is promiscuous.

17:49.902 --> 17:53.029
How about those guys on that bench
over there? They look pathetic.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.156
I bet we could talk to them.

17:55.324 --> 17:57.325
That's a mirror.

17:58.827 --> 18:00.620
Oh, yeah.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.248
Hey, fellas, mall's closing.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.584
- Sorry.
- Yeah. Good night.

18:07.961 --> 18:10.129
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

18:12.841 --> 18:15.176
Do you like being
a mall security guard?

18:16.637 --> 18:20.181
- It's all right.
- Okay, nice talking to you.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.771
Smooth!

18:36.365 --> 18:40.326
- Can't sleep?
- No.

18:44.248 --> 18:46.415
Would you like to talk about it?

18:48.418 --> 18:51.671
Penny proposed,
and I didn't say yes.

18:53.340 --> 18:58.970
- Why not?
- That's a good question.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.391
Does that mean the
relationship is over?

19:04.893 --> 19:06.435
I don't know.

19:07.729 --> 19:08.938
Why don't you ask her?

19:11.733 --> 19:15.027
Because I'm afraid
to know the answer.

19:19.449 --> 19:23.244
Well... I'm sorry.

19:25.914 --> 19:29.750
That's it? You're not
gonna make some dumb joke

19:29.918 --> 19:31.711
or some inappropriate comment?

19:31.879 --> 19:33.421
No.

19:34.548 --> 19:38.801
You're my friend, and... I'm sorry.

19:44.391 --> 19:47.435
Did you just put
a "kick me" sign on my back?

19:53.233 --> 19:55.193
No.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.612
That wouldn't be funny at all.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.668
Star Wars audition, take one.

20:13.879 --> 20:18.466
Starring Howard Joel Wolowitz,
real-life astronaut.

20:24.973 --> 20:26.974
Vader is here,

20:27.142 --> 20:29.810
now, on this moon.

20:29.978 --> 20:31.604
I felt his presence.

20:31.772 --> 20:34.982
He's come for me.
He can feel when I'm near...

20:35.150 --> 20:36.317
How many times
do I have to tell you

20:36.485 --> 20:39.237
to replace the toilet paper
when it's empty?!

20:40.405 --> 20:43.950
- I'm in the middle of something!
- So am I!
