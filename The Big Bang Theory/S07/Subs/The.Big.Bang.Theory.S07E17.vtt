WEBVTT

00:04.754 --> 00:06.213
Raj, your tag's sticking out.

00:06.381 --> 00:09.133
Thank you. That's the closest
I've come to sex in, like, two years.

00:11.594 --> 00:13.137
Now I feel a little gross.

00:13.930 --> 00:15.931
You're only making it seem
more real for me.

00:17.934 --> 00:19.268
Hey, that's my wife.

00:19.436 --> 00:21.895
If anyone's gonna make her feel
gross about sex, it's me.

00:22.731 --> 00:25.774
Can we please talk about something
other than my depressing love life?

00:25.942 --> 00:28.027
How about Penny's
depressing acting career?

00:30.363 --> 00:33.699
Hey. It's been a little tough,
but Penny's following her dreams,

00:33.867 --> 00:36.076
and in my book,
that is not depressing.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.619
Aw, thank you.

00:37.787 --> 00:39.955
Is that book called
Lies I Tell to Get Sex?

00:41.499 --> 00:44.251
Is that a real book?
I would totally read that book.

00:45.295 --> 00:46.962
Can I borrow it when you're done?

00:51.801 --> 00:53.052
Well, I'll have you guys know

00:53.219 --> 00:54.887
I turned down a part
in a movie last week.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.221
Why would you do that?

00:56.306 --> 00:57.389
Because it was crap.

00:57.557 --> 01:00.142
It was a sequel to that awful
killer gorilla movie I was in.

01:00.643 --> 01:01.935
Serial Ape-ist?

01:03.688 --> 01:05.022
I thought you died in that.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.857
She does. 42 minutes in.

01:07.025 --> 01:10.027
While showering topless,
16 minutes after brief side butt

01:10.195 --> 01:12.075
during a pillow fight
with her sorority sisters.

01:14.449 --> 01:17.326
I have an eidetic memory.
I don't know what his problem is.

01:18.661 --> 01:20.661
Okay, well, there are no
shower scenes in this one.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.348
They just try to clone me
from my corpse,

01:22.373 --> 01:24.249
but my DNA gets mixed
with the ape's DNA

01:24.417 --> 01:27.127
and I end up running around
with giant gorilla hands and feet.

01:29.506 --> 01:32.424
Am I missing something, or isn't that
the part she was born to play?

01:59.702 --> 02:02.121
So are you really not
gonna do this movie?

02:02.288 --> 02:05.124
Well, I don't think it's the kind
of part that's good for my career.

02:05.416 --> 02:09.503
But don't a lot of famous actors
get their start doing bad movies?

02:09.671 --> 02:12.047
Okay, I don't think Meryl Streep
ever had to say,

02:12.215 --> 02:15.384
"Must keep gorilla hands
from killing again!"

02:18.638 --> 02:21.557
If she did, it would be amazing.
That woman can do no wrong.

02:23.601 --> 02:26.186
I don't know anything
about show business,

02:26.354 --> 02:28.730
so if you think it's reasonable
to turn down paid work

02:28.898 --> 02:30.357
and just burn through
your savings,

02:30.358 --> 02:31.859
I'm sure you know what
you're doing.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.658
I think we're gonna go.

02:40.785 --> 02:42.494
Are you sure?

02:42.495 --> 02:44.204
We were making fun of
failed careers.

02:44.372 --> 02:46.540
We didn't get to tap
the juicy vein that is Howard's.

02:48.334 --> 02:50.878
Hey, I work
at the same university you do.

02:51.045 --> 02:53.255
Yes, and Hawkeye's in
the avengers,

02:53.423 --> 02:55.257
but no one ever says,
"Help, Hawkeye!"

02:57.677 --> 02:59.261
Can I ask you something?

02:59.429 --> 03:01.930
Why do you constantly feel
the need to put down my husband?

03:02.098 --> 03:03.724
I'm sure he does it out of love.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.772
The same way my boyfriend
makes me feel terrible

03:05.935 --> 03:07.561
about my life choices.

03:10.273 --> 03:11.773
I think we're gonna go.

03:12.609 --> 03:14.443
No, no. This is not a fight.

03:14.611 --> 03:17.487
I was just excited that
someone offered you a part

03:17.655 --> 03:19.406
and a little surprised
that you'd rather sit at home

03:19.574 --> 03:20.908
and do nothing than take it.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.663
Now it's a fight.

03:28.541 --> 03:29.875
Well, with that sorted out,

03:30.043 --> 03:31.844
I'm happy to answer your
question, Bernadette.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.420
Howard started it.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.631
I didn't do anything.
I was just sitting here.

03:35.798 --> 03:37.466
I wasn't referring to this evening.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.718
Ten years ago,
upon first seeing me,

03:39.886 --> 03:42.137
your husband claimed
that I looked like C-3PO

03:42.305 --> 03:43.931
and Pee-wee Herman.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.977
And he called me
C-3P-wee Herman.

03:51.731 --> 03:54.441
Still funny.

03:56.986 --> 03:58.654
That was ten years ago.

03:59.113 --> 04:01.448
Nine years, 11 months
and three weeks ago,

04:01.616 --> 04:04.493
he followed that up by replacing
the slides for my lecture

04:04.661 --> 04:07.496
with photographs
of nude fat women bending over.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.083
Really?

04:11.251 --> 04:12.876
The lecture was on
cosmic gas clouds.

04:12.877 --> 04:14.503
That's funny!

04:16.339 --> 04:18.257
I was there. It was funny.

04:22.887 --> 04:25.847
In any event, that began
a decade-long progression

04:26.015 --> 04:29.643
of insults, pranks and
unwanted magazine subscriptions.

04:30.186 --> 04:31.979
To this day,
I still get a monthly copy

04:32.146 --> 04:33.855
of Granny on Granny.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.526
Which, other than its
surprisingly fun puzzle page,

04:37.694 --> 04:38.819
is complete filth.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.658
Thanks for walking me to my car.

04:45.368 --> 04:46.910
Actually, it's for both of us.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.558
Last night, I watched
West Side Story,

04:48.663 --> 04:50.539
and I'm a little freaked out
by street gangs.

04:52.417 --> 04:55.502
Why can't Raj find a girl?
The mystery continues.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.840
I don't appreciate your sarcasm,

05:00.008 --> 05:02.426
but we've still got two blocks
to go, so I'll put up with it.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.930
Whatever happened with
your online dating?

05:07.098 --> 05:10.058
No one was writing me back,
so I stopped checking my profile.

05:10.226 --> 05:12.561
Before I met Sheldon,
I was ready to give up, too.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.479
Once, I even dropped
in on my OB/GYN

05:14.647 --> 05:16.606
just to get some human contact.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.360
It has been a while
since I got my prostate checked.

05:22.030 --> 05:25.073
Then I met Sheldon
and look at where we are now.

05:25.616 --> 05:28.243
What? You've kissed, like,
once in three years.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.788
That's true.
Do whatever you want.

05:35.251 --> 05:37.169
- Hey.
- Hello.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.547
Listen, I was thinking you and I

05:40.715 --> 05:44.134
could probably try
to be better friends.

05:44.302 --> 05:45.802
Really?

05:45.970 --> 05:48.513
I was thinking
what we have now is a bit much.

05:52.185 --> 05:56.313
Seriously, I was talking
to Bernadette last night and

05:56.481 --> 05:58.565
she made some great points.

05:58.733 --> 06:01.735
You and I have known each other
a long time,

06:01.903 --> 06:04.738
and I didn't hear the rest
'cause she took her bra off.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.452
Very well.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.121
How do you propose
we move forward?

06:13.289 --> 06:17.042
For starters, we could stop
insulting each other.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.794
That's a great idea.

06:18.961 --> 06:20.629
And in the spirit
of our new arrangement,

06:20.797 --> 06:23.548
I will mask my surprise
that you came up with it.

06:29.013 --> 06:31.473
Anyway, I got invited
to do a little talk at NASA

06:31.641 --> 06:33.183
in Houston this weekend.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.811
They gave me two tickets.
Bernadette can't go.

06:35.978 --> 06:38.313
You want to come with me?
You can visit your mom,

06:38.481 --> 06:40.732
and I'll show you
around the space center.

06:42.276 --> 06:43.652
I have one question.

06:44.612 --> 06:47.697
Is this a prank
where we land in Houston

06:47.865 --> 06:49.491
and you've made up
wanted posters

06:49.659 --> 06:52.411
that have my face with
a mustache and a Spanish name

06:52.578 --> 06:55.163
and then I get arrested
and deported to South America?

06:57.667 --> 06:58.667
No.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.835
I'm glad because I would not
have seen that coming.

07:04.882 --> 07:07.342
Amy, I could use some help.

07:07.510 --> 07:10.095
Let me guess. There's an undergrad
in a leather jacket

07:10.263 --> 07:12.264
snapping his fingers
by the water fountain.

07:14.142 --> 07:16.393
I thought about
what you said last night,

07:16.561 --> 07:18.395
and I went back
on the dating website

07:18.563 --> 07:20.814
and I was looking
at this girl's profile.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.065
She's amazing.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.401
Oh, she's cute.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.486
And smart. Phi Beta Kappa.

07:26.654 --> 07:28.029
And judging by her lack
of Adam's apple,

07:28.197 --> 07:30.073
she's been female her entire life.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.203
I like that in a woman.

07:36.372 --> 07:38.331
Great,
so what do you need me for?

07:38.499 --> 07:40.208
Well, I was up all night trying
to write to her,

07:40.376 --> 07:42.127
but I wanted to run it by
you first.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.712
- All right.

07:45.548 --> 07:46.798
"Emily,

07:47.383 --> 07:50.385
your face is like
a precious dew-kissed flower."

07:50.553 --> 07:51.761
Wow.

07:51.929 --> 07:54.389
I know.
Powerful stuff, huh?

07:55.516 --> 08:00.645
No. You're supposed to be yourself,
not all desperate and creepy.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.398
Okay, I'm getting
some mixed messages here.

08:04.567 --> 08:08.195
Just say something normal like,
"I saw your profile.

08:08.362 --> 08:10.405
"Looks like we have
a lot in common.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.407
Let's get a cup of coffee sometime."

08:12.575 --> 08:16.661
Yes. "Where I can be jealous of
the cup touching your ruby lips."

08:19.457 --> 08:20.749
Or you just write it for me.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.292
I'm not gonna pretend to be you.

08:22.460 --> 08:23.960
I don't want you
to pretend to be me.

08:24.128 --> 08:26.171
You can be my online wingman.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.924
Like if we met her at a bar
and you talked me up.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.051
Well, what would I say to her?

08:31.302 --> 08:33.094
Just tell her what I'm really like.

08:34.138 --> 08:36.431
And, if you think it'll help,

08:36.599 --> 08:38.840
that you saw me changing once
and my package reminded you

08:38.935 --> 08:41.228
of the muscular tail of a jaguar.

08:47.318 --> 08:48.902
Use your own words.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.950
Thanks again for taking me
to the pharmacy.

08:55.117 --> 08:57.035
It's no problem.
Is everything okay?

08:57.203 --> 09:00.997
I'm fine. It's just some
stomach medication for my trip.

09:01.165 --> 09:03.875
There's the remote
yet distinct possibility

09:04.043 --> 09:06.336
that I may end up
in South America.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.882
Remember the old days when I
would've said something dumb

09:11.050 --> 09:12.842
like, "Why?"

09:17.765 --> 09:19.307
Uh, that doesn't sound good.

09:20.476 --> 09:22.310
Remember the old days
when I used to point out

09:22.478 --> 09:24.145
that your check engine light
was on?

09:25.940 --> 09:28.233
- Yes.
- Get ready to go down memory lane.

09:28.401 --> 09:31.528
- Penny, your check engine...
- Yeah, I know it's on, Sheldon!

09:31.696 --> 09:34.990
Oh, no, no.
I cannot afford this right now.

09:35.658 --> 09:37.409
Maybe it's just something minor.

09:46.168 --> 09:47.794
Oh, good news,
the light just went out.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.136
Are we playing individual
or teams?

09:56.304 --> 09:57.304
Teams are fun.

09:57.471 --> 10:00.390
In that case, I'd like to be
partnered with my good friend Howard.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.519
But I'm always on Howard's team.
We're best friends.

10:04.687 --> 10:07.856
The kind who finish each others...

10:11.360 --> 10:12.681
I really don't think we do tha...

10:12.737 --> 10:14.404
Do that! See?

10:16.741 --> 10:18.950
- Oh, hi.
- How'd it go at the mechanic?

10:19.118 --> 10:20.638
Not great.
Can I talk to you for a sec?

10:20.703 --> 10:22.203
Yeah, sure.

10:23.539 --> 10:25.999
Maybe I can go with you
guys to Houston?

10:26.167 --> 10:27.528
Isn't it late to get plane tick...

10:27.543 --> 10:29.044
Plane tickets? Yeah.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.839
- Will you please sto...
- Stop that? Okay.

10:35.843 --> 10:38.243
I don't know what to do.
My car threw a rod and it's totaled.

10:38.262 --> 10:39.823
I can't afford a new one,
I have no job,

10:39.930 --> 10:41.330
and now I can't drive to auditions.

10:41.390 --> 10:42.974
I'm so sorry.

10:43.142 --> 10:44.851
I know it's a sensitive subject,

10:45.019 --> 10:47.020
but can you reconsider
that part in the movie?

10:47.188 --> 10:49.356
I did. I called them.
The part's gone.

10:49.523 --> 10:51.191
They gave it to someone else.

10:51.359 --> 10:53.568
Now that girl's gonna get
discovered and become famous

10:53.736 --> 10:55.737
and go on Letterman and talk
about how she got her big break

10:55.905 --> 10:56.905
on a cheap monkey movie

10:57.073 --> 10:59.574
all because some dumb girl
thought it was beneath her.

11:01.577 --> 11:03.536
At least they talked
about you on Letterman.

11:06.415 --> 11:08.458
Come on, I can drive you
wherever you need to go.

11:08.626 --> 11:11.086
How?
Unlike me, you have a job.

11:11.587 --> 11:13.755
I'm just gonna have to go back
to being a waitress.

11:13.923 --> 11:16.049
Like I will be
for the rest of my life.

11:16.842 --> 11:19.010
Leonard, would you wrap it up?
We're waiting on you.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.762
I'm sorry, is the fact
that my life's falling apart

11:21.764 --> 11:23.682
interfering with your board game?

11:24.350 --> 11:25.767
It is.

11:28.771 --> 11:31.648
You were wrong, friend Howard.
She completely understood.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.320
Hey, you busy?

11:37.488 --> 11:38.613
No. What's up?

11:38.781 --> 11:40.699
Have you heard back from Emily?

11:40.866 --> 11:41.866
I have.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.576
Great! And?

11:43.744 --> 11:46.746
And I'm afraid she doesn't think
you're right for her.

11:48.874 --> 11:51.751
I give you one simple thing to do.

11:51.919 --> 11:54.504
Contact a complete stranger and
make her fall in love with me,

11:54.672 --> 11:56.131
and you blow it!

11:57.508 --> 11:59.426
I told her what a good guy you are,

11:59.593 --> 12:01.761
but she thought it was a bad sign

12:01.929 --> 12:03.847
that you didn't write
to her yourself.

12:04.014 --> 12:08.017
She thought it made you seem
too shy and passive.

12:08.185 --> 12:09.519
I'm not too shy and passive.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.938
You write her back
and tell her I said that.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.150
You know,
when you have a second.

12:16.610 --> 12:19.154
Look, I'll see if I can change
her mind tomorrow night.

12:19.321 --> 12:20.739
What's happening tomorrow night?

12:20.906 --> 12:22.657
I'm meeting her for coffee.

12:23.325 --> 12:24.325
What?

12:24.493 --> 12:27.162
We emailed back and forth a bit,
and we kind of hit it off.

12:27.329 --> 12:29.205
I find a girl I like,
and you're stealing her?

12:29.373 --> 12:31.708
No. We just ended up
having a lot in common.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.668
We went to Harvard,
we like Chaucer,

12:33.836 --> 12:36.504
we're both hardcore into quilting.

12:39.592 --> 12:43.303
Your words fall like acid rain
on the wounded petals of my heart.

12:46.515 --> 12:49.434
That's Sheldon.
He says he'll be down in a minute.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.395
- What are you doing?

12:52.480 --> 12:54.022
He's not coming out
until he sees proof

12:54.190 --> 12:56.357
you don't have an air freshener
in your car.

12:58.569 --> 13:00.779
This is gonna be a long weekend
for you.

13:00.946 --> 13:02.655
You're the reason I'm doing it!

13:02.823 --> 13:04.616
I said to stop insulting each other.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.327
I didn't tell you to take him
on a romantic getaway.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.705
How do I know what you said?

13:10.873 --> 13:13.708
Damn you and your
noise-cancelling breasts.

13:16.712 --> 13:18.630
- Hello.
- Hey, buddy.

13:20.382 --> 13:21.633
You excited for Texas?

13:21.801 --> 13:23.384
Oh, very much so.

13:23.552 --> 13:27.013
It's not every day you get to
tour NASA with a real astronaut.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.265
Who's the real astronaut?

13:32.853 --> 13:35.396
- Buzz Aldrin.
- Oh. Yay!

13:49.286 --> 13:51.454
Howard?
Howard?

13:52.206 --> 13:53.706
Howard?

13:56.460 --> 13:57.836
What now?

13:58.963 --> 14:00.123
I have to go to the bathroom.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.381
You just went to the bathroom.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.925
I didn't use it because
it didn't seem safe.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.762
Despite all my emails,
the toilet didn't have a seatbelt.

14:10.349 --> 14:11.808
Well, it still doesn't.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.142
I realize that,

14:13.310 --> 14:16.479
but safety concerns went out
the window two apple juices ago.

14:18.065 --> 14:19.440
Fine.

14:21.151 --> 14:22.318
Why are you getting annoyed?

14:22.486 --> 14:24.779
I'm trying to be a better friend,

14:24.947 --> 14:28.950
but you constantly say
and do irritating things.

14:29.118 --> 14:30.702
- Like when?
- When?

14:30.870 --> 14:34.122
How about in the car?
I'm an astronaut, and you know it.

14:34.290 --> 14:37.250
You just don't like admitting it,
because you're jealous.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.755
Well, truth be told,

14:42.923 --> 14:45.383
as a child,
I did dream of going to space.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.552
Those astronauts were my heroes.

14:47.720 --> 14:52.015
And when you got to go,
it was hard for me.

14:54.935 --> 14:56.102
Thank you.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.688
Because it made me realize
they'll just send anyone up there.

15:01.817 --> 15:03.526
- Aren't you going to let me out?
- No.

15:03.694 --> 15:05.570
But I still need to use the bathroom.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.488
Here you go. Be creative.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.453
What's the matter?
Scared of a little turbulence?

15:13.954 --> 15:17.206
No, turbulence is
just the equalization

15:17.374 --> 15:20.084
of diurnal temperature
variations in the atmosphere.

15:20.252 --> 15:21.794
I'm not scared at all.

15:22.546 --> 15:24.547
Oh, apple juice,
stay where you are.

15:26.592 --> 15:29.010
Oh, this is nothing.
I experienced way worse

15:29.178 --> 15:30.887
when I was plummeting
back to Earth,

15:31.055 --> 15:33.681
apparently not being
a real astronaut.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.685
Okay, that was a big one.

15:39.855 --> 15:41.230
I take it back.
I'm scared of turbulence!

15:41.398 --> 15:42.941
I'm gonna need that bag back.

15:46.987 --> 15:48.237
You sure you want to do this?

15:48.405 --> 15:50.448
Yeah. Why wouldn't I want
to get my old job back?

15:50.616 --> 15:52.033
It'll be fun to see everyone.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.118
I haven't talked to them
since I said, "I quit.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.037
See you at the Oscars, bitches."

15:57.790 --> 15:59.540
Come on, let's just
get this over with.

15:59.708 --> 16:00.917
"Let's get this over with."

16:01.085 --> 16:02.765
Am I driving you
to the Cheesecake Factory,

16:02.836 --> 16:04.462
or are we having sex?

16:06.173 --> 16:07.613
I'm just trying to lighten the mood.

16:07.716 --> 16:09.258
- I know. Thank you.
- Sorry.

16:09.426 --> 16:11.052
It's just so humiliating.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.637
So humiliating?

16:12.805 --> 16:14.389
Am I driving you to
the Cheesecake Factory...?

16:14.556 --> 16:16.516
I'm sorry.
I'll stop. I'll stop.

16:19.144 --> 16:21.813
Come on, don't look so sad.
You never know what's gonna happen.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.272
Maybe tonight will be great.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.191
Sweetie, I know you're trying
to make me feel better,

16:25.359 --> 16:27.068
and I love you for that,
but it's making me feel worse,

16:27.236 --> 16:28.653
and I kind of hate you.

16:31.740 --> 16:32.907
This isn't your car.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.493
I know. I thought we'd take yours.

16:38.539 --> 16:39.706
I don't understand.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.126
It's nothing fancy,
but it'll get you to auditions,

16:43.293 --> 16:45.773
and at least for now, you don't
have to go back to waitressing.

16:48.799 --> 16:50.383
I don't know what to say.

16:52.386 --> 16:53.845
Don't say anything.

16:54.138 --> 16:55.430
Oh, my God.

16:56.932 --> 16:59.600
I mean, you could say, "Thank you."
I did just buy you a car.

17:04.940 --> 17:08.276
Look, I admit that it's odd that
Rajesh didn't write to you himself,

17:08.444 --> 17:12.905
but if you get to know him, you'll
see he's just a sweet, regular guy.

17:13.073 --> 17:16.075
As a counterpoint, here he is,
uninvited and visibly sweaty.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.286
- Hello, Emily.
- Hello.

17:18.454 --> 17:22.290
Amy told me you were concerned
that I might be too passive and shy.

17:22.458 --> 17:23.958
Let me ask you something.

17:24.126 --> 17:28.463
Would a passive guy barge in here
to look you in the eye and say,

17:28.630 --> 17:30.923
"Hey, dew-kissed flower, what's up?"

17:35.345 --> 17:38.264
No, but a weird guy
with no boundaries might.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.016
Okay, that's a separate issue.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.852
Let's put a pin in that
and just focus on the passive thing.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.228
I'm leaving.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.597
Are we still going to go to
that Chaucer reading Friday?

17:46.607 --> 17:48.408
You know, I think
I'm just gonna go by myself.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.988
Not my best first date.

17:56.533 --> 17:58.076
Yeah, but not my worst, either.

18:02.831 --> 18:04.832
I'm sorry for every mean thing
I ever did or said to you!

18:05.000 --> 18:07.126
I'm sorry, too!
It's all my fault!

18:08.837 --> 18:11.506
If you weren't my friend,
there'd be a hole in my life!

18:11.673 --> 18:13.049
Thank you, Sheldon.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.426
Kind of like when
Firefly was cancelled.

18:17.137 --> 18:18.471
But not as big.

18:26.146 --> 18:28.439
The captain has turned off
the fasten seat belt sign.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.691
You're now free
to move about the cabin.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.986
- It's over.
- Yeah.

18:37.157 --> 18:39.909
Should we stop
holding hands now?

18:42.579 --> 18:44.288
- In a minute.
- Okay, good.
