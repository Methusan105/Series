WEBVTT

00:08.925 --> 00:10.384
T-minus 60 seconds!

00:10.552 --> 00:12.344
It all comes down to this!

00:13.263 --> 00:14.638
I've got butterflies.

00:14.806 --> 00:16.515
Don't get soft on me, Hofstadter.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.684
I will slap those glasses
right off your face.

00:21.646 --> 00:22.646
What's going on?

00:22.814 --> 00:24.773
Hey. We're about
to buy tickets for Comic-Con.

00:26.901 --> 00:28.277
T-minus 45 seconds!

00:28.445 --> 00:30.821
They sell out incredibly fast,
but as long as one of us gets in...

00:30.989 --> 00:33.670
Good Lord, this is not the time
for flirting! Keep it in your pants!

00:35.326 --> 00:37.619
It's a whole lot
of weird before coffee.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.205
T-minus 30 seconds!

00:40.373 --> 00:42.750
Oh, I have to go
to the bathroom so bad.

00:42.917 --> 00:44.877
Every year!
I told you, wear a diaper!

00:45.045 --> 00:46.545
And I told you I get diaper rash!

00:46.713 --> 00:47.880
15 seconds!

00:48.048 --> 00:50.382
Oh, this is it!

00:53.303 --> 00:54.803
This is it.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.806
Five, four, three,

00:57.974 --> 00:59.266
two, one.

00:59.434 --> 01:00.851
It's live. Go! Go! Go!

01:08.068 --> 01:09.068
Anyone in?

01:09.235 --> 01:10.611
- No!
- Not yet!

01:11.905 --> 01:13.739
Do not stop refreshing your screens!

01:13.907 --> 01:15.574
- Refresh.
- Refresh.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.951
Refresh. Refresh...

01:20.663 --> 01:22.623
Yeah, this is not
gonna be enough coffee.

01:51.236 --> 01:53.987
Refresh... Refresh...

01:56.407 --> 01:59.451
- Refresh.
- Refresh.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.871
Refresh. It's been ten minutes!
We're running out of time.

02:03.039 --> 02:04.873
To be cool? Yeah.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.691
I did it! I did it!
I'm in the queue!

02:09.462 --> 02:12.339
And they say firefighters
are the real heroes.

02:13.424 --> 02:15.259
What number in line are you?

02:15.426 --> 02:16.635
- Fifteen...
- Great!

02:16.803 --> 02:18.637
- ...thousand, 211.
- Damn!

02:20.390 --> 02:22.683
They only have Thursday
and Sunday passes left.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.060
- Really?
- Thursday's gone. Just Sunday left.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.062
Sunday's the worst!

02:27.230 --> 02:30.065
Everybody's leaving,
most of the good panels are over,

02:30.233 --> 02:33.735
and the only T-shirts
they have left are small and XXXXL.

02:36.739 --> 02:39.575
- Sunday's gone.
- Not Sunday! I love Sunday!

02:42.453 --> 02:44.663
So that's it?
Everything's sold out?

02:45.748 --> 02:46.915
Yeah.

02:48.084 --> 02:50.210
I can't believe we're not going.

02:51.254 --> 02:52.588
It's okay.

02:53.381 --> 02:55.799
There-there's always WonderCon
in Anaheim.

02:57.802 --> 02:59.344
That's just as good.

03:00.763 --> 03:02.181
Excuse me.

03:08.479 --> 03:11.148
Guys, this is really sad.

03:11.774 --> 03:14.401
And in a different way
than it was 20 minutes ago.

03:17.322 --> 03:20.574
I can't believe we wasted all
that time on our Hulk costumes.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.701
What? You were all going as the Hulk?

03:22.869 --> 03:24.119
Not the same Hulk.

03:24.537 --> 03:26.413
Ferrigno, Bana, Norton and Ruffalo.

03:29.167 --> 03:32.294
We would have been the angry green
belles of the masquerade ball.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.130
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.884
And we're back
to the first kind of sad.

03:42.013 --> 03:46.475
Gentlemen, I have the solution
to our Comic-Con problem.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.143
We don't need them.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.395
I'm starting my own convention.

03:52.732 --> 03:55.150
Sheldon, just buy
scalped tickets with us.

03:55.318 --> 03:58.820
I told you. Buying scalped
tickets is against the rules.

03:58.988 --> 04:02.282
If you get caught, you get
banned from Comic-Con for life.

04:02.450 --> 04:03.825
Life, Leonard.

04:03.993 --> 04:06.154
You're gonna feel pretty silly
when we're 80 years old,

04:06.287 --> 04:07.687
and you have to drive me down there

04:07.705 --> 04:09.456
and then wait in the car
for three days.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.464
Do what you want.
We're getting scalped tickets.

04:13.586 --> 04:16.004
I already found a guy online
who's willing to sell.

04:16.172 --> 04:18.215
How do you know
this isn't a sting operation

04:18.383 --> 04:20.384
set up by the Comic-Con police?

04:21.803 --> 04:24.888
The same way I know that the people
in the TV set can't see me.

04:26.432 --> 04:27.516
Sheldon, just come with us.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.768
You're not gonna make
your own convention.

04:29.936 --> 04:33.021
You know, there was a time
when Comic-Con didn't exist at all

04:33.189 --> 04:36.775
until one lone dreamer
with a unique vision made it happen.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.820
And you mark my words,
I'm gonna rip that guy off.

04:43.366 --> 04:46.785
Yes, I'm starting
my own comic book convention,

04:46.953 --> 04:49.871
and I thought that your client,
Robert Downey Jr.,

04:50.039 --> 04:53.959
would be perfect to appear
on our first panel.

04:54.877 --> 04:57.629
Well, now, why are you saying "no"?
You haven't even asked him yet.

04:58.965 --> 05:01.216
You know, excuse me,
but I sat through Iron Man 2.

05:01.384 --> 05:03.719
I believe he owes me
two hours of his time.

05:05.763 --> 05:07.347
They hung up on me.

05:12.061 --> 05:13.895
Did you tell them that you're
holding your convention at

05:14.105 --> 05:17.190
a Marie Callender's, and that every
panelist gets a free slice of pie?

05:18.318 --> 05:20.027
I didn't even get to that part.

05:21.195 --> 05:23.989
Look, even your friend Wil Wheaton
thinks this is a waste of time.

05:24.157 --> 05:27.492
Not true.
Wil thinks this is a great idea.

05:27.660 --> 05:30.412
He was just concerned that
he wasn't a big enough celebrity

05:30.580 --> 05:32.664
to headline such an amazing event.

05:32.832 --> 05:35.584
Also, that's the same day
that he shampoos his beard.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.589
Sheldon, I just don't think this
is going to come together for you.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.090
You don't know that.

05:42.258 --> 05:44.885
I still have plenty
of solid leads on this list.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.386
- Good luck.
- No, wait.

05:46.554 --> 05:49.014
I need you to call Stan Lee,
Leonard Nimoy

05:49.182 --> 05:50.932
and Bill Nye the Science Guy.

05:52.101 --> 05:54.019
'Cause, legally, I'm not allowed to.

05:55.104 --> 05:57.022
Oh, and, also,
Carrie Fisher, you know,

05:57.190 --> 05:59.107
'cause I hear she can be pretty nuts.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.939
I can't believe Leonard
is spending hundreds of dollars

06:04.072 --> 06:05.405
on scalped tickets.

06:05.573 --> 06:07.866
Last week, you spent
that on a little dress.

06:08.701 --> 06:10.741
Yeah, but those tickets
only get him into Comic-Con.

06:10.828 --> 06:12.954
That dress gets me
into anywhere I want.

06:15.416 --> 06:17.209
Those tickets were pretty expensive.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.836
I had to give Howie an advance
on his allowance.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.091
Now he's never gonna
put his toys away.

06:25.510 --> 06:26.968
Why can't they do something sensible

06:27.136 --> 06:29.638
like Sheldon and start their
own comic book convention?

06:31.099 --> 06:33.642
Also, who wants
to throw me out that window?

06:35.520 --> 06:38.480
While they're acting like teenagers,
we could do something grown-up.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.357
Oh. You mean like a museum?

06:40.525 --> 06:43.151
Yes, like a museum,
but anything else.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.864
I know. There's a nice hotel
not far from here

06:48.032 --> 06:49.574
where they do afternoon tea.

06:49.742 --> 06:52.119
Afternoon tea,
how sophisticated of us.

06:52.286 --> 06:53.686
All right, if we're gonna be fancy,

06:53.746 --> 06:55.997
I should probably put on
clean underwear.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.167
La-dee-da!
Look who has clean underwear.

06:59.335 --> 07:00.975
No, we're gonna stop at Target
on the way.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.425
Since Sheldon's
not going to Comic-Con,

07:06.592 --> 07:08.969
maybe we could find a cool trio
to dress up as.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.045
What if we go as The Fantastic Four,
and just tell people

07:12.181 --> 07:14.182
that The Invisible Girl
is standing there with us.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.413
Oh, and I thought our days
of pretending

07:17.520 --> 07:19.200
to be with women
who don't exist were over.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.233
Gentlemen, I am one step away

07:23.401 --> 07:26.695
from securing a huge guest
for my convention.

07:26.863 --> 07:29.614
Does that step include chloroform
and a roll of duct tape?

07:30.783 --> 07:33.952
I don't think that will be necessary
for Mr. James Earl Jones.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.621
You heard me.
The voice of Darth Vader,

07:36.789 --> 07:38.373
the Lion King's dad,

07:38.541 --> 07:41.960
and FYI, the guy who says,
"This is CNN."

07:43.921 --> 07:45.839
Which also sounds like Darth Vader.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.719
How are you gonna get
James Earl Jones?

07:50.887 --> 07:54.222
Simple. Earlier today, he Tweeted
that he's looking forward

07:54.390 --> 07:56.933
to going to his favorite
sushi restaurant for dinner.

07:57.101 --> 07:59.478
I Googled an interview
from four years ago

07:59.645 --> 08:02.814
which was conducted in
his favorite sushi restaurant.

08:02.982 --> 08:06.359
That's where he'll be,
and that's where I'm going, and...

08:06.527 --> 08:09.237
And that's where Darth Vader's gonna
pour soy sauce on your head.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.909
Sheldon, I don't care if you get
scalped tickets with us or not,

08:14.076 --> 08:16.912
but please don't be creepy
and go stalking this poor guy.

08:17.079 --> 08:18.663
You're gonna get in trouble.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.790
You're the ones
who are going to get in trouble.

08:20.958 --> 08:22.959
You're buying
non-transferable tickets.

08:23.127 --> 08:25.253
And from a stranger, no less.

08:25.421 --> 08:27.422
Not only can you get
banned from Comic-Con,

08:27.590 --> 08:30.300
if caught, you could be charged
with petty theft.

08:30.468 --> 08:33.011
You think about that while
I'm warning James Earl Jones

08:33.179 --> 08:35.639
about the danger of posting
his location on Twitter.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.851
He got lucky this time.
There are some weirdoes out there.

08:54.158 --> 08:55.659
Forgot my keys.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.125
Okay, great. Bye.

09:05.127 --> 09:07.963
Our friendly neighborhood scalper
says he's running late.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.131
Does he sound like a criminal?

09:12.009 --> 09:13.218
What do you mean?

09:13.386 --> 09:18.765
You know, did he say things like,
"Youse guys," or "Listen here, see?"

09:21.811 --> 09:25.063
Yes. He's late because
he's on his way here from 1940.

09:27.149 --> 09:28.990
I'm just saying.
We don't know who this guy is.

09:29.110 --> 09:31.110
What if he wants to steal
our money or our kidneys,

09:31.237 --> 09:33.280
or make a suit out of our skins?

09:34.448 --> 09:37.409
Why would someone want to make
clothes out of your skin?

09:37.577 --> 09:40.787
I don't know. Maybe 'cause
dark doesn't show the stains?

09:43.165 --> 09:44.833
Now you're making me wonder
if we should have met him

09:45.001 --> 09:46.167
at a neutral location.

09:46.335 --> 09:48.503
Why do you think I told him
to come to your place?

09:58.180 --> 10:00.015
There sure are a lot
of little kids here.

10:00.182 --> 10:02.582
I can't believe we thought this
would makes us feel grown up.

10:02.727 --> 10:05.020
I can't believe the waiter
thought I was your daughter.

10:08.190 --> 10:11.192
Last time I got dressed up
and had tea was when I was five.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.112
Just me, my teddy bear,
Raggedy Ann and my hamster.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.947
- That's cute.
- It was.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.575
Until my hamster ate all her babies.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.163
It got less cute really fast.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.417
- Should we leave?
- There's a bar in the lobby.

10:27.793 --> 10:28.918
I could go for a drink.

10:29.253 --> 10:31.963
Aw. Drinking in the afternoon,
just like her mommy.

10:45.561 --> 10:46.895
Let me guess.

10:47.563 --> 10:49.731
You like Star Wars.

10:53.569 --> 10:56.446
You know, I've been in other movies.

10:59.033 --> 11:01.493
But you don't care
about those, do you?

11:09.418 --> 11:12.212
I have one thing to say
to people like you...

11:13.631 --> 11:15.715
I like Star Wars, too!

11:18.636 --> 11:19.636
Care to join me?

11:20.846 --> 11:22.263
Thank you.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.433
My friend Leonard said
if I bothered you

11:25.601 --> 11:28.395
while you were eating,
you'd think I was a creepy stalker.

11:28.562 --> 11:33.400
Well, your friend Leonard
sounds like a real weenie.

11:36.570 --> 11:39.322
He is, Mr. Earl Jones, he is.

11:42.451 --> 11:45.286
Okay, I'm on a Comic-Con
message board,

11:45.454 --> 11:47.372
and there's a post from a guy

11:47.540 --> 11:50.625
where he says he got caught
using someone else's badge,

11:50.793 --> 11:53.253
and Sheldon was right,
he did get charged with petty theft.

11:53.421 --> 11:56.506
Guys, if I go to jail
dressed as the Human Torch,

11:56.674 --> 11:58.258
that might send the wrong message.

12:02.304 --> 12:04.180
Maybe this isn't a good idea.

12:04.348 --> 12:08.143
I can text the guy and tell him
we changed our minds.

12:09.437 --> 12:10.812
Do it.

12:10.980 --> 12:14.899
Okay. We're officially
not going to Comic-Con.

12:17.361 --> 12:19.279
Hold on.
We always do this.

12:19.655 --> 12:21.823
- Do what?
- Chicken out.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.511
We're so afraid
of getting into trouble

12:23.659 --> 12:25.160
that we never do anything wrong.

12:25.327 --> 12:26.688
That's 'cause we're the good guys.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.705
Even Batman breaks the rules.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.582
You know I struggle with Batman.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.420
I say, this one time,
instead of wimping out,

12:35.588 --> 12:37.547
let's be badasses!

12:38.674 --> 12:40.216
Okay, I'll be a badass.

12:40.384 --> 12:42.343
But only if you pinky-swear
to be one, too.

12:44.972 --> 12:46.264
Howard, you in on this?

12:46.599 --> 12:49.225
No need.
I'm breaking rules all the time.

12:50.311 --> 12:51.519
Name one.

12:51.687 --> 12:52.812
Last night.

12:52.980 --> 12:55.690
Drank my Pepto
straight out of the bottle.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.753
What about that little
cup they give you?

12:59.862 --> 13:01.029
Yeah.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.448
What about it?

13:07.244 --> 13:08.284
Are you impressed by that?

13:08.412 --> 13:09.954
- A little.
- Yeah, me, too.

13:13.709 --> 13:16.795
When I first read the script for
Empire Strikes Back

13:16.962 --> 13:20.423
and Darth Vader told Luke
he was his father,

13:20.591 --> 13:22.467
I thought for sure he was lying.

13:23.427 --> 13:26.095
Me, too!
But he wasn't, was he?

13:26.263 --> 13:27.722
He was not!

13:27.890 --> 13:29.933
How messed up was that?

13:31.602 --> 13:33.061
So messed up.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.939
What do you say
let's go have some fun?

13:36.690 --> 13:38.691
My wife's in New York,
and I got a Lion King

13:38.859 --> 13:41.402
residual check
burning a hole in my pocket.

13:44.406 --> 13:46.950
So, afternoon tea was a bust.

13:47.117 --> 13:48.837
On the bright side,
every six-year-old there

13:48.911 --> 13:50.662
was jealous of my tiara.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.541
Not gonna lie, it felt good.

13:56.377 --> 13:57.669
Let me ask you a question:

13:57.837 --> 13:59.438
When did you guys
start feeling grown up?

13:59.588 --> 14:00.964
'Cause I am not sure I do.

14:01.799 --> 14:03.800
Honestly, I thought when
I got married I would,

14:03.968 --> 14:06.094
but I still kind of feel
like I'm pretending.

14:06.595 --> 14:09.347
It doesn't help that most of
my clothes come from Gap Kids.

14:11.392 --> 14:12.767
Okay, so I'm an adult,

14:12.935 --> 14:15.436
and the other day I saw
an old man slip and fall down,

14:15.604 --> 14:17.564
and I laughed.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.983
I mean, I laughed hard.

14:20.901 --> 14:22.777
Like, out loud.

14:23.529 --> 14:25.488
If he was conscious,
he would've heard me.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.824
- Oh, my gosh.
- I know.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.672
One of the tennis balls
came off his walker

14:29.827 --> 14:32.662
and bounced right off his head.
I mean...

14:33.622 --> 14:35.623
I almost wet myself.

14:37.626 --> 14:39.168
I guess you had to be there.

14:40.754 --> 14:42.255
I think I have you both beat.

14:42.423 --> 14:43.673
Imagine trying to feel
like a grown-up

14:43.841 --> 14:45.133
when you've never
even been with a man.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.552
Sex is not what makes you a grown-up.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.138
Yeah. Or you'd be
the oldest one here.

14:52.641 --> 14:55.101
Really? Is that how you
talk to your mother?

14:59.940 --> 15:01.441
He just parked.
He's on his way up.

15:01.609 --> 15:02.817
Good. This is exciting.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.193
It is. I feel alive.

15:04.361 --> 15:06.529
What if we do get caught?
Who cares?

15:06.697 --> 15:08.114
So we get banned from Comic-Con.

15:08.282 --> 15:09.616
Maybe slapped with a fine.

15:09.783 --> 15:11.868
I'll be an astronaut and a bad boy.

15:12.036 --> 15:14.078
How will women keep their pants on?

15:15.497 --> 15:17.999
Maybe it'll come up when
I apply for citizenship.

15:19.543 --> 15:22.045
Oh, crap, what if it comes up
when I apply for citizenship?

15:23.005 --> 15:24.756
I wonder if we'd have
to disclose something like this

15:24.924 --> 15:26.549
when we apply for grants.

15:27.509 --> 15:29.093
He's gonna be here any second,
what should we do?

15:29.261 --> 15:31.012
You guys are such babies.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.639
I'll handle this.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.100
If he thinks we're not home,
he'll go away.

15:38.854 --> 15:39.975
I thought you were a badass.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.273
I lied about the Pepto,
I always use the little cup!

15:49.615 --> 15:52.951
Is it true, as a child,
you were a stutterer

15:53.118 --> 15:55.912
and were functionally
mute for eight years?

15:56.080 --> 15:57.372
It is true.

15:58.332 --> 16:01.501
Is it true they used scuba gear

16:01.627 --> 16:03.836
to create the sound of
Darth Vader breathing?

16:04.046 --> 16:06.005
- They sure did.
- Oh.

16:06.924 --> 16:10.551
Is it true that you
were pre-med in college

16:10.719 --> 16:12.387
and you almost became a doctor?

16:12.554 --> 16:15.098
- That's right.
- Oh, James!

16:16.141 --> 16:18.267
I could listen
to your stories all night.

16:27.945 --> 16:30.613
I mean, really, what's
so great about being grown up?

16:30.781 --> 16:34.242
Well, for starters, we'd be
splitting this check three ways.

16:36.453 --> 16:38.287
I'm serious.
Who wants to do all that stuff?

16:38.455 --> 16:40.456
Have insurance, pay mortgages,

16:40.624 --> 16:43.251
leave one of those little notes
when you hit a parked car.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.629
I told you it was Penny.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.132
Oh, come on, it wasn't me.

16:49.299 --> 16:52.802
Anyone could have knocked your
mirror off or whatever happened.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.056
Maybe the guys are right.

16:57.224 --> 16:59.142
We spent the whole night
trying to be mature,

16:59.309 --> 17:00.768
and it was kind of boring.

17:00.936 --> 17:02.979
I'm sure they're having
more fun than we are.

17:05.441 --> 17:08.359
God, I could really use exactly
two tablespoons of Pepto right now.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.706
Hey, Los Angeles!

17:21.874 --> 17:24.584
I'm on a Ferris wheel
with Darth Vader!

17:25.753 --> 17:27.712
And he's nicer than you think!

17:29.465 --> 17:31.215
I am!

17:41.727 --> 17:42.810
Bring it home, Mufasa.

17:52.488 --> 17:53.888
I don't understand
what we're doing.

17:53.989 --> 17:55.239
Shh.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.283
Whose house is that?

17:57.451 --> 17:58.993
Carrie Fisher.

17:59.703 --> 18:02.538
And she's a little crazy,
so get ready to run.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.639
It's not funny anymore, James!

18:21.642 --> 18:24.227
Then why am I laughing!

18:32.361 --> 18:35.863
Sheldon, this is the perfect end
to a perfect night.

18:37.908 --> 18:39.450
Okay.

18:40.744 --> 18:43.037
But I think it could have ended
with the karaoke.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.916
What were you trying to ask me
at the strip club?

18:48.877 --> 18:52.380
Oh. How much does it cost
to get them off my lap?

18:53.841 --> 18:55.716
No. Something about a convention.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.261
Oh, right! Well...

18:58.428 --> 19:01.430
...my friends and I couldn't
get into Comic-Con this year,

19:01.598 --> 19:04.225
and I was trying to start
my own convention,

19:04.393 --> 19:08.104
and I was going to ask
if you would be a panelist.

19:09.064 --> 19:11.482
Why don't you and your friends
come to Comic-Con with me?

19:11.650 --> 19:13.151
- Really?
- Of course.

19:13.318 --> 19:15.403
And San Diego is
right across the border

19:15.571 --> 19:19.574
from my favorite city on Earth,
Tijuana...

19:21.743 --> 19:23.703
...where I'm taking you
every night!

19:26.206 --> 19:27.540
Ay-ay-ay.

19:29.084 --> 19:31.002
Ay-ay-ay, bang-bang.

19:37.676 --> 19:40.511
So, Beau Bridges
is on my shoulders,

19:40.679 --> 19:44.056
and Jeff Bridges is
on Marlon Brando's shoulders,

19:44.224 --> 19:47.602
and remember, we do not have
permission to be in the pool.

19:47.769 --> 19:49.812
Hey! Sheldon, wake up!

19:50.981 --> 19:53.649
Angie Dickinson is about to
sic the dogs on us,

19:53.817 --> 19:56.277
and I go under the water and
Marlon goes under the water,

19:56.445 --> 19:58.112
and the water raises
about two feet

19:58.280 --> 19:59.572
and sloshes all over her patio,

19:59.740 --> 20:01.616
and the dogs freak out
and run like hell,

20:01.783 --> 20:03.284
then we run like hell...

20:03.785 --> 20:05.119
Oh, boy!

20:05.287 --> 20:07.079
That was a lot of fun.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.292
Who's Angie Dickinson?
