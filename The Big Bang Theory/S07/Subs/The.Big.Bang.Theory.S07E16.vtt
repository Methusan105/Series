WEBVTT

00:03.920 --> 00:05.838
I'm thinking about growing a goatee.

00:06.131 --> 00:09.258
Actually that's a Van Dyke.
A goatee is just hair on the chin.

00:09.634 --> 00:12.344
Oh. Wait, then what is it
if you just have hair up here?

00:12.512 --> 00:13.512
You mean a mustache?

00:13.680 --> 00:14.930
- Moo-stache!
- He said it!

00:15.598 --> 00:17.891
Ha-ha, very funny.
Make fun of the foreign guy.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.352
For your information,
there are four times as many Indians

00:20.520 --> 00:22.438
as there are Americans,
so the way we say it is right.

00:22.605 --> 00:23.814
- Say what?
- Moo-stache.

00:23.982 --> 00:25.733
- Moo-stache!
- He said "moo-stache".

00:26.943 --> 00:28.277
Guys, you're being childish.

00:28.445 --> 00:31.572
She's right. You're grown men,
the kind who are perfectly capable

00:31.740 --> 00:33.449
of growing your own moo-staches.

00:35.326 --> 00:37.995
Hey, you were funny
on purpose, good job.

00:39.622 --> 00:41.623
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
I was at an audition.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.959
- I'm sorry.
- You'll get 'em next time.

00:45.628 --> 00:49.214
How about instead of assuming I
failed, you ask me how it went?

00:49.299 --> 00:50.758
Sorry. How did it go?

00:50.925 --> 00:52.342
Just shut up.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.296
Here, you can have your seat.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.221
No, no, stay there.
I'm fine on the floor.

00:56.931 --> 00:59.331
Have you guys ever thought about
getting a dining room table?

00:59.476 --> 01:01.935
Yeah. You actually do have
room for one up there.

01:02.103 --> 01:04.938
Sure, I sit on the floor
for years, no one cares.

01:05.023 --> 01:06.315
The pretty white girl's
there ten seconds,

01:06.483 --> 01:08.650
and suddenly we're
all running to IKEA.

01:10.111 --> 01:11.820
No one is running anywhere.

01:11.988 --> 01:13.781
We're not getting
a dining room table.

01:13.948 --> 01:16.658
I know you don't like change,
but it's not a terrible idea.

01:16.826 --> 01:18.410
You guys never use
that space up there.

01:18.578 --> 01:19.578
Why not get a table?

01:19.746 --> 01:21.663
Do you want the long answer
or the short answer?

01:21.831 --> 01:23.749
How come we never get that option?

01:25.376 --> 01:29.004
Chaos theory suggests that
even in a deterministic system,

01:29.172 --> 01:32.091
if the equations describing
its behavior are nonlinear,

01:32.258 --> 01:34.343
a tiny change
in the initial conditions

01:34.511 --> 01:37.638
can lead to a cataclysmic
and unpredictable result.

01:38.139 --> 01:39.139
Translation?

01:39.307 --> 01:41.475
Wah! I don't want a table!

02:10.839 --> 02:13.340
Hey, Penny and I are gonna go
shop for a dining room table.

02:13.508 --> 02:14.675
You want to come with us?

02:14.843 --> 02:18.595
I'd love to, but, I'm too busy

02:18.763 --> 02:21.932
falling back in love
with Windows 98.

02:23.601 --> 02:25.894
Seriously? You haven't used
this desk in years.

02:26.062 --> 02:28.063
The second I want to get rid of it,
you're up here working?

02:28.231 --> 02:29.606
I can't talk right now.

02:29.774 --> 02:32.234
I have several thousand updates
to install.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.945
Are you really
gonna sit here all day?

02:35.113 --> 02:37.489
Think of me as Arthur Dent in

02:37.657 --> 02:39.700
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,

02:39.868 --> 02:42.744
lying in front of the bulldozers
to protect his home.

02:42.912 --> 02:46.165
If you'll recall, the Vogon fleet
blew up the Earth anyway.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.972
It's a made-up story. I don't even
know why you're talking about it.

02:50.003 --> 02:53.005
I'm putting all this stuff
in storage. We don't need any of it.

02:53.131 --> 02:54.840
How can you say that?

02:54.924 --> 02:58.343
You show me one thing
in here we can live without.

02:58.428 --> 02:59.928
Hang on.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.017
Check your in-box.

03:06.936 --> 03:09.563
Wait. Is this really worth it?

03:09.731 --> 03:13.609
We've lived together for years
with nary an argument.

03:13.776 --> 03:14.776
Huh?

03:14.944 --> 03:16.737
But we start talking about a table,

03:16.905 --> 03:18.947
and suddenly we're
at each other's throats.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.367
"Nary an argument"?

03:24.245 --> 03:26.205
"Nary"?

03:27.123 --> 03:29.291
That means "not one," or "not any".

03:30.460 --> 03:32.878
Maybe instead of a table,
you should buy a dictionary.

03:36.299 --> 03:39.551
I don't know if I won that,
but at least he's upset.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.638
Check it out.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.184
Magic wand TV remote!

03:47.352 --> 03:49.811
Yeah, I can control
all sorts of stuff.

03:49.979 --> 03:51.355
Did Bernadette think it was cool?

03:51.522 --> 03:54.650
Not when I said "mute"
and pointed it at her face.

03:54.817 --> 03:56.485
Let me try.

03:58.446 --> 04:00.447
Channelis changeroni!

04:01.741 --> 04:05.077
This might be my second
favorite brown magic wand.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.709
Well, that's the last time
I play with that.

04:16.506 --> 04:18.048
I have to take this.

04:18.883 --> 04:20.259
Hello?

04:21.344 --> 04:22.803
Off.

04:22.887 --> 04:24.554
And on.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.390
And the Oprah Network.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.269
This is so much better than
watching TV like a muggle.

04:32.230 --> 04:35.107
Okay. Thank you.
We'll be in touch.

04:37.610 --> 04:38.986
You're not gonna believe this.

04:39.862 --> 04:40.946
What's going on?

04:41.823 --> 04:43.156
Wait.

04:44.158 --> 04:45.367
On!

04:45.535 --> 04:46.994
And off!

04:48.705 --> 04:50.289
What's going on?

04:53.334 --> 04:55.377
That was NASA.

04:55.461 --> 04:58.839
They want me to go
back up to the space station.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.508
Wow. What did you tell them?

05:01.676 --> 05:03.176
I told them I'd be honored.

05:04.053 --> 05:06.596
A second trip to space.
I'll miss you.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.140
And I'm gonna miss you, too.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.308
I just want you to know,

05:09.475 --> 05:11.310
I'm happy to look in on Bernadette
while you're gone.

05:11.519 --> 05:12.519
Thank you.

05:12.687 --> 05:13.895
And if anything were to happen
to you,

05:14.063 --> 05:16.023
we will name our
firstborn son Howard.

05:18.234 --> 05:19.401
I'm just kidding.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.249
We'll name him Dalib,
after my grandfather.

05:24.615 --> 05:26.408
This one looks nice.

05:26.534 --> 05:29.202
No. Sheldon doesn't like
reclaimed wood.

05:30.288 --> 05:31.288
Why not?

05:31.372 --> 05:33.999
He's afraid the original owners
will come back.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.252
Well, Sheldon's not here.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.628
Well, he is here.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.674
Unless you want to dig him out
with a bone saw and a melon baller,

05:42.842 --> 05:44.760
there's nothing I can do about it.

05:44.927 --> 05:46.847
All right, sweetie,
you're paying for this table,

05:46.929 --> 05:48.089
and it's your apartment, too.

05:48.097 --> 05:49.765
- I know, but...
- No buts.

05:49.932 --> 05:52.517
You got to stop
letting him boss you around.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.937
You're right. I mean,
he decides what TV shows we watch,

05:56.105 --> 05:58.440
what food we eat,
who my favorite hobbit is.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.650
I wanted Frodo,
but we can't both have Frodo,

06:00.818 --> 06:02.861
so guess who's stuck
with Samwise Gamgee.

06:04.739 --> 06:06.406
See? Right there.
You're a grown man,

06:06.574 --> 06:08.742
you should be able to pick
whichever hobbit you want.

06:10.119 --> 06:12.621
Wish you wouldn't,
but one problem at a time.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.958
You make a lot of sense.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.795
I like this table,
and I'm getting it.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.963
Really? This one?

06:24.217 --> 06:25.467
That one?

06:25.968 --> 06:27.594
Damn right I like that one.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.433
- Hey.
- Good news.

06:33.601 --> 06:37.312
Someone in this room
gets to take a ride on a rocket.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.232
Fine.
Can I at least shower first?

06:41.442 --> 06:42.442
No, not that.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.650
Although you already agreed
to it, so no take-backs.

06:45.154 --> 06:46.235
What are you talking about?

06:46.364 --> 06:47.656
Sit down.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.409
NASA called.

06:50.576 --> 06:53.537
The telescope mount
I installed on the space station

06:53.704 --> 06:58.041
got damaged, and they want me
to go back up and fix it.

06:59.335 --> 07:00.460
Wow.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.671
Well, what did you say?

07:02.839 --> 07:05.382
What do you think I...?
I said yes!

07:05.508 --> 07:06.548
Why do you look surprised?

07:06.592 --> 07:08.343
Well, it's just, after last time,

07:08.469 --> 07:10.178
I didn't think you'd
ever want to go back.

07:10.304 --> 07:13.432
Are you kidding? It was the greatest
experience of my life.

07:13.558 --> 07:16.560
Really? 'Cause I kind of
remember a lot of complaining

07:16.727 --> 07:18.854
and wishing for it to be over.

07:20.022 --> 07:21.314
I think you have me confused

07:21.482 --> 07:24.067
with what's gonna happen when
you get out of that shower.

07:29.198 --> 07:30.699
Hey, all set.
What do you think?

07:30.867 --> 07:33.743
There's plenty of room for everybody,
a view out the window.

07:33.911 --> 07:36.079
My spot on the couch
has a great view of a window.

07:36.122 --> 07:39.040
Sometimes I can see
space battles through it.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.292
It's called a TV.

07:42.003 --> 07:44.713
Give it a chance, Sheldon,
you might actually like it.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.466
You're absolutely right.

07:50.094 --> 07:51.553
Nope.

07:53.806 --> 07:56.224
Well, you can't say he
didn't give it a fair shot.

07:56.392 --> 07:58.059
So, when can we get rid of it?

07:58.186 --> 07:59.186
We're not.

07:59.187 --> 08:01.146
What about the roommate agreement?

08:01.314 --> 08:04.107
It specifically states
that any changes in furnishing

08:04.275 --> 08:06.234
have to be approved
by the Furnishing Committee.

08:06.402 --> 08:08.528
Which only sits on alternate years.

08:08.696 --> 08:11.323
Yeah, and by the way,
it sits over there.

08:12.116 --> 08:13.700
Come on, that is ridiculous.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.995
She's right. A committee that
important should meet more often.

08:17.622 --> 08:18.955
That's not what I'm saying.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.833
This is the thing
about me standing up to him

08:22.001 --> 08:23.281
and not letting him run my life?

08:23.377 --> 08:24.544
Yes.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.171
That.

08:26.923 --> 08:29.841
Okay. I think we've
found the problem here.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.760
It's not the table at all.

08:31.928 --> 08:32.969
It's you.

08:33.137 --> 08:34.262
Me?

08:34.430 --> 08:36.431
It's always me,
take one for the team.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.559
I have spent years
turning this lump of clay

08:39.727 --> 08:41.811
into an acceptable conduit
for my will,

08:41.979 --> 08:44.397
and then you came along
and reshaped him,

08:44.565 --> 08:47.734
with your newfangled ideas
and your fancy genitals.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.112
Are you gonna let him
talk to me like this?

08:51.239 --> 08:53.365
"Fancy" sounds like a compliment.

08:54.116 --> 08:55.867
Okay, I have not tried
to change Leonard.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.675
That's just what happens
in relationships.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.454
Look how much Amy's changed you.

08:59.580 --> 09:01.623
- That's not true.
- Please.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.458
When I first met you,
you were incapable

09:03.626 --> 09:05.001
of touching another human being.

09:05.086 --> 09:07.671
Now you're holding hands,
you're going on dates,

09:07.838 --> 09:09.839
you even made out with her
on a train.

09:10.341 --> 09:11.591
She told you?

09:11.759 --> 09:13.552
Of course she told me,
it's the most interesting thing

09:13.719 --> 09:15.560
that's ever happened to
her in her entire life!

09:16.764 --> 09:20.559
You're too close to it,
but Amy has had a huge impact on you.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.144
You're right.

09:23.938 --> 09:26.022
Without realizing it,
I've allowed that woman

09:26.190 --> 09:27.774
to alter my personality.

09:28.609 --> 09:30.151
Sheldon, you didn't
have a personality,

09:30.319 --> 09:32.070
you just had some shows you liked.

09:34.865 --> 09:36.032
No.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.742
No, I've changed.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.120
Like the frog who's put
in a pot of water

09:40.288 --> 09:41.621
that's heated so gradually

09:41.789 --> 09:43.915
he doesn't realize
he's boiling to death.

09:44.041 --> 09:46.126
Or you're the frog who's
been kissed by a princess

09:46.294 --> 09:47.460
and turned into a prince.

09:47.628 --> 09:49.921
Or you're just a tall, annoying frog.

09:50.798 --> 09:52.257
Excuse me.

09:52.383 --> 09:54.175
I have to break up
with my girlfriend.

09:54.343 --> 09:56.678
- Sheldon, wait.
- No.

09:56.846 --> 09:59.014
You've opened my eyes to the truth.

09:59.181 --> 10:03.059
Amy has made me a more affectionate,
open-minded person.

10:03.978 --> 10:06.396
And that stops now.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.692
- We should call her.
- Yeah.

10:13.070 --> 10:15.488
Amy, it's Penny. Hey.
Just a little heads-up.

10:15.656 --> 10:17.949
Leonard bought a dining room table.

10:18.659 --> 10:20.368
Yeah. Sheldon's breaking up with you.

10:25.666 --> 10:27.751
Amy? Amy?

10:28.544 --> 10:29.711
Amy?

10:30.463 --> 10:31.921
I'll get right to the point.

10:32.089 --> 10:35.258
I think we need to end this
relationship, so...

10:35.426 --> 10:38.094
Just sign this
with your finger, and...

10:38.262 --> 10:42.599
please don't cry on my iPad.
I didn't get AppleCare.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.769
I'm not surprised you want
to end the relationship.

10:45.936 --> 10:48.480
I'm a little surprised
you didn't get AppleCare.

10:49.899 --> 10:52.233
Anyway, enjoy your life.
Where do I sign?

10:52.401 --> 10:54.069
At the bottom. I must say,

10:54.236 --> 10:56.696
I'm relieved you're not making
more of a scene out of this.

10:56.864 --> 10:58.239
I've already moved on.

10:58.366 --> 11:01.326
Besides, this breakup has
nothing to do with me.

11:01.410 --> 11:02.410
It doesn't?

11:02.578 --> 11:04.621
Of course not.
This is just Leonard

11:04.789 --> 11:07.165
trying to take the focus
off that dreadful table

11:07.333 --> 11:08.958
by sowing discord
in our relationship.

11:09.126 --> 11:11.378
He's manipulating you
like he always does.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.422
Wait, now, hang on.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.966
You think he manipulates me?

11:17.134 --> 11:18.176
All the time.

11:19.220 --> 11:22.347
And he knew that as your girlfriend,
I wasn't gonna stand by

11:22.515 --> 11:24.849
and let him bring a table
into your apartment.

11:25.017 --> 11:27.102
I mean, a table? Come on!

11:29.563 --> 11:31.106
It is hideous.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.566
Well, thankfully,
I won't have to see it,

11:33.734 --> 11:35.374
'cause I won't be your
girlfriend anymore.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.571
Amy Farrah Fowler.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.282
Why, yes, I would like
to take a survey.

11:41.450 --> 11:42.951
Wait.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.247
You were really gonna stand by me
against the dining room table?

11:48.624 --> 11:50.083
Of course I was.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.460
Wait.

11:52.628 --> 11:56.047
How do I know that you're
not manipulating me right now?

11:57.591 --> 12:00.468
I think if I were manipulating you,
you'd be smart enough to see it.

12:02.638 --> 12:05.765
How do I know you're not saying that
as part of the manipulation?

12:07.101 --> 12:09.436
I think you'd be smart
enough to see that, too.

12:12.398 --> 12:13.773
Okay.

12:14.525 --> 12:16.925
I'm sorry I gave you such a hard
time, I just had to be sure.

12:20.656 --> 12:23.908
It's pretty exciting that NASA
wants to send Howard back up.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.660
Yeah, exciting.

12:26.495 --> 12:27.829
Can I ask you something?

12:27.997 --> 12:29.247
Course.

12:29.373 --> 12:31.583
He hated that entire experience.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.042
Does it make me an awful wife

12:33.210 --> 12:34.836
if I don't think he
should do it again?

12:35.004 --> 12:36.254
Not at all.

12:36.422 --> 12:39.507
He's forgotten how miserable he was
the entire time he was up there.

12:39.675 --> 12:43.344
It's like me in those moments
when I miss India.

12:44.305 --> 12:45.388
So you'll talk to him?

12:45.556 --> 12:46.556
Why me?

12:46.557 --> 12:48.725
I'm his wife,
I don't want to ruin it for him.

12:48.893 --> 12:51.644
That's the dynamic. I'm the
fun one, you're the buzzkill.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.897
Since when am I the buzzkill?

12:54.690 --> 12:56.851
- Do you think this is cool?
- No, I think it's stupid.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.109
Aha!

13:00.196 --> 13:01.613
You're right, it's great.

13:06.410 --> 13:07.744
- Hello.
- Hey.

13:07.828 --> 13:09.078
You guys didn't break up.

13:09.163 --> 13:13.041
No. Sorry to disappoint you,
but Amy pointed out

13:13.125 --> 13:14.918
that you we only trying
to manipulate me.

13:15.085 --> 13:16.211
Which you also
figured out by yourself.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.463
Which I also figured out by myself.

13:20.257 --> 13:21.737
Well, I'm glad you're still together.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.552
Okay, you can stop trying
to make this about our relationship.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.263
- Which is stronger than ever.
- Which is stronger than ever.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.975
This is about you
trying to change my environment,

13:31.143 --> 13:32.894
which was perfect the way it was.

13:33.062 --> 13:35.814
But it got the way it was
through change.

13:35.981 --> 13:39.317
The spot that you love to sit in,
that no one else can sit in,

13:39.485 --> 13:43.988
only exists because, despite your
objections, I bought this couch.

13:44.114 --> 13:48.993
Me. So explain why that change
was bad and this change was good.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.455
Um...

13:53.833 --> 13:55.250
You don't need to
explain yourself to him.

13:55.417 --> 13:57.627
I don't need to explain
myself to you!

13:58.754 --> 14:00.995
You're sick of his nonsense
and ready to move in with me.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.924
Keep the table!
We don't use that space!

14:09.265 --> 14:10.849
Damn it, I got cocky.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.437
Hey, Bernie.
I'm home... Hello.

14:16.605 --> 14:17.647
Hi, honey.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.023
What's going on?

14:19.942 --> 14:21.234
Maybe you should have a seat.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.987
Okay.

14:24.113 --> 14:26.155
I know my mom's not dead,
there'd be balloons.

14:28.242 --> 14:32.245
First off, know that
we all love you and cherish you.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.247
- Well, I wouldn't...
- Daddy.

14:35.249 --> 14:36.791
You're great.

14:38.460 --> 14:40.753
- Can I say something?
- Of course.

14:43.007 --> 14:44.424
Hey, Fruit Loops.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.302
Massimino?
Why are you here?

14:47.469 --> 14:50.430
I heard you were thinking about going
back up to the space station,

14:50.556 --> 14:52.807
and as someone
who's been there with you...

14:52.975 --> 14:55.375
well, you know how astronauts
need to have the "right stuff"?

14:55.477 --> 14:56.853
Sure.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.897
The stuff you have is wrong.

15:02.484 --> 15:04.903
You don't think
I did a good job up there?

15:05.070 --> 15:06.446
You did a fine job.

15:06.614 --> 15:09.407
It's just, you were scared
and miserable the whole time.

15:10.492 --> 15:13.372
I think what we're all trying to say
is, you don't seem to be remembering

15:13.537 --> 15:15.538
how traumatic the experience
was for you.

15:15.623 --> 15:18.917
Like how women often forget
the pain of childbirth.

15:19.335 --> 15:21.377
Like a woman. Great analogy.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.214
Fine, maybe I was a little scared.

15:25.382 --> 15:27.300
You peed in your space suit.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.510
You're supposed to do that.

15:29.678 --> 15:31.638
Not during the fitting.

15:33.307 --> 15:36.017
Son, do I need to remind you
what you asked me to do

15:36.185 --> 15:37.810
before you went up last time?

15:37.978 --> 15:40.688
Hang on.
That was just me joking around.

15:40.856 --> 15:43.191
You wanted me to shoot you
in the foot.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.361
Come on, how is that not a joke?

15:46.528 --> 15:48.648
"You got to get me out of this.
Shoot me in the foot."

15:50.658 --> 15:53.201
Don't forget all the other
astronauts picking on you.

15:53.827 --> 15:55.370
And how you threw up
in zero gravity,

15:55.537 --> 15:57.246
and it floated back in your mouth.

15:58.457 --> 16:01.501
And you threw up again.
And so on and so on.

16:04.004 --> 16:05.505
That was funny.

16:06.840 --> 16:10.218
Okay, so I wasn't
exactly John Glenn up there,

16:10.386 --> 16:13.262
but I've changed,
I'm a different man now.

16:13.430 --> 16:17.392
I'm a little insulted that you guys
don't think I can handle it.

16:17.559 --> 16:20.119
You know you're gonna have to go
through survival training again.

16:20.187 --> 16:21.396
Really?

16:21.522 --> 16:23.815
You've got to get me out of this!

16:23.941 --> 16:26.317
What do you want me to do?
You're perfectly healthy.

16:26.485 --> 16:28.152
Check my blood pressure again!

16:28.320 --> 16:30.405
I can get it higher,
just give me a second.

16:32.908 --> 16:35.159
- Hello?
- Hi, Ma. How are you?

16:36.203 --> 16:37.996
How I am is not dead!

16:38.163 --> 16:40.540
But you wouldn't know that,
because you don't love me enough

16:40.708 --> 16:42.000
to pick up the phone!

16:42.167 --> 16:43.584
Go, go, go!

16:44.753 --> 16:48.089
For all you know, I could have
slipped in the tub and drowned!

16:48.257 --> 16:50.341
That's what happened
to your Aunt Ida!

16:52.136 --> 16:53.678
Wow.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.768
Howard, I'm so sorry your blood
pressure was off the charts.

17:00.936 --> 17:04.605
Me, too. The doctor was willing
to fudge the results,

17:04.773 --> 17:07.984
but it just seemed
so darned dishonest.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.409
But the mission wouldn't be
for at least a year.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.323
Isn't that enough time to get
your blood pressure under...

17:14.491 --> 17:16.909
My blood pressure's too high, okay?
Drop it.

17:18.954 --> 17:21.539
You know, my aunt changed her diet,
and in a few months, she...

17:21.707 --> 17:24.292
Went to space? I don't think so.
Now, pass the soy sauce.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.835
Not the green one, the red one.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.214
Sheldon, Amy,
will you please come join us?

17:30.340 --> 17:31.632
It's fun up here.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.177
So why are you trying to ruin it?

17:35.345 --> 17:37.388
No, thanks. We're fine.

17:37.556 --> 17:39.515
I mean, if you people
want to eat at the table,

17:39.683 --> 17:41.517
then that's what you should do.

17:41.685 --> 17:43.227
I like eating down here

17:43.395 --> 17:45.980
because this is how
we've always done things.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.357
But if those days are gone,
they're gone.

17:48.525 --> 17:51.069
It just makes me sad.

17:52.821 --> 17:53.988
Now I feel bad.

17:54.156 --> 17:56.574
Don't anthropomorphize him,
he's got big eyes,

17:56.742 --> 17:58.951
but his feelings are not like ours.

18:01.789 --> 18:04.290
No, it just seems silly
for us to sit in two groups.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.209
It's not silly
if you think of that group

18:06.376 --> 18:08.878
as being led by a big, evil baby.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.802
Look at Amy down there.

18:16.637 --> 18:17.970
Should we go?

18:18.597 --> 18:19.889
Let's go.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.599
Penny, this was your idea.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.518
You said that I should
stand up to him.

18:23.685 --> 18:24.977
Forget it, Leonard.

18:25.145 --> 18:26.604
It's over.

18:27.856 --> 18:28.898
Fine.

18:35.405 --> 18:36.697
Rajesh?

18:36.865 --> 18:38.533
Screw that! I sat
on the floor for seven years.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.368
I'm staying right here!

18:41.662 --> 18:43.996
Come on, Raj,
it's not the same without you.

18:45.290 --> 18:46.707
Fine.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.586
But no more making fun
of how I say tings.

18:51.213 --> 18:53.339
You mean "tings"
like "moo-stache"?

18:59.930 --> 19:01.681
Well, isn't this nice.

19:04.268 --> 19:06.018
Sometimes the baby wins.
