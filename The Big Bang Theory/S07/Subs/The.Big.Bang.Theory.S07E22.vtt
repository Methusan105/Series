00:03.336 --> 00:06.588
Gentlemen, Star Wars Day
is rapidly approaching.

00:06.756 --> 00:08.424
We should finalize our plans.

00:08.591 --> 00:10.592
What? That's a real thing?

00:11.511 --> 00:13.721
What is it, Star Wars Christmas?

00:13.888 --> 00:16.265
No. Don't be ridiculous.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.308
That's Wookie Life Day.

00:19.811 --> 00:20.811
So when is it?

00:20.979 --> 00:23.480
Well, it's not May the fifth,

00:23.648 --> 00:26.108
and it's not May the third...

00:30.447 --> 00:32.948
It's May the fourth.

00:34.492 --> 00:35.826
Get it?

00:36.578 --> 00:39.580
May the "fourth" be with you?

00:40.540 --> 00:42.708
"May the force be with you."
Get it?

00:42.876 --> 00:45.294
Oh, no, this face
wasn't because I didn't get it.

01:12.197 --> 01:14.114
...Come in.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.951
Hey, you got a second?

01:18.119 --> 01:20.412
Yes. Actually, I'm glad you're here.

01:20.580 --> 01:23.499
I'm working on
the Star Wars Day schedule.

01:23.666 --> 01:27.252
Now, I have a window built in
after Phantom Menace,

01:27.420 --> 01:29.338
for complaining, but...

01:31.424 --> 01:34.176
...I'm worried an hour
won't be enough time.

01:37.138 --> 01:39.598
Sheldon, I've got some bad news.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.475
What is it?

01:42.477 --> 01:46.522
I just read online that
Arthur Jeffries passed away.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.609
Professor Proton is dead?

01:51.820 --> 01:53.529
Sorry, buddy.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.874
What are you doing?

02:06.918 --> 02:08.377
Comforting you?

02:09.337 --> 02:11.547
Your heart might be
in the right place,

02:11.714 --> 02:13.966
but your head, chest
and arms certainly aren't.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.137
Anyway, the funeral's on Sunday.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.681
But, that's Star Wars Day.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.891
Yeah...

02:23.059 --> 02:25.310
Of all the things about this
that are sad,

02:25.478 --> 02:27.396
that might not be number one.

02:29.732 --> 02:31.900
You OK?
I know he meant a lot to you.

02:32.986 --> 02:33.986
I'm fine.

02:35.697 --> 02:36.989
OK.

02:38.825 --> 02:42.202
Yet he cried when they changed
the Raisin Bran box.

02:44.205 --> 02:47.207
This is something
interesting, boys and girls.

02:47.375 --> 02:51.170
After an owl eats,
he spits up part of his meal,

02:51.337 --> 02:54.756
that he can't digest,
in the form of a pellet.

02:57.886 --> 03:00.053
Is... Isn't that a hoot?

03:04.100 --> 03:07.603
We'll be right back
after I fire my writers.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.939
...Oh, shut up.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.610
Watching your old friend?

03:14.777 --> 03:17.613
Yes. Look at him, Amy.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.281
It's such a shame.

03:19.449 --> 03:22.201
Struck down
in the prime of my life.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.747
Do you want me to go to
the funeral with you?

03:26.915 --> 03:30.250
- I'm not going to the funeral.
- Why not?

03:30.418 --> 03:32.461
All those people
blowing their noses.

03:33.796 --> 03:36.465
You can't tell the sick
from the sad.

03:36.633 --> 03:40.469
I'll be at home celebrating
Star Wars Day, as planned.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.971
Are you sure you don't
want to go say good-bye?

03:43.139 --> 03:48.435
Amy, mourning the inevitable
is a complete waste of time.

03:48.603 --> 03:50.979
And watching a bunch
of goofy space movies

03:51.147 --> 03:53.482
you've seen hundreds
of times isn't?

03:54.400 --> 03:56.109
If we were in
a physical relationship,

03:56.277 --> 03:57.653
you just lost sex tonight.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.449
Hey, guys.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.868
Hey, Penny.
Happy Star Wars Day.

04:07.288 --> 04:08.538
OK.

04:09.540 --> 04:10.874
Can I make you breakfast?

04:11.042 --> 04:14.211
Admiral Ackbar's Snack Bar
is open for business.

04:15.296 --> 04:17.497
No, thanks. Leonard and I
are just going to the funeral.

04:17.548 --> 04:19.466
You sure? Not even coffee?

04:19.634 --> 04:21.343
We have R2-Decaf.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.264
Maybe a nice Cafe Au Leia?

04:26.349 --> 04:28.058
And if you're not
in the mood for coffee,

04:28.226 --> 04:30.310
I can always make you
a Chai Tea-3PO.

04:31.145 --> 04:34.398
I get it... like C-3PO.

04:34.565 --> 04:37.067
What happened to me?

04:38.111 --> 04:41.321
- Hey, Sheldon, you want anything?
- No, thank you.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.031
You're being so quiet.

04:43.199 --> 04:46.493
Are you upset
or are you just rebooting?

04:46.661 --> 04:48.287
I'm fine.

04:48.454 --> 04:51.206
Sweetie, are you sure you don't want
to come with us to the funeral?

04:51.374 --> 04:54.501
I appreciate the offer,
but Arthur is gone

04:54.669 --> 04:56.378
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.839
When Darth Vader
struck down Obi-Wan,

04:59.007 --> 05:01.967
did Luke cry like a baby
and go to his funeral?

05:02.135 --> 05:03.677
No, he blew up the Death Star.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.637
Why do I know this?!

05:06.764 --> 05:08.974
Arthur Jeffries was a scientist.

05:09.142 --> 05:13.020
I'm sure he didn't care about
silly superstitions like funerals.

05:13.187 --> 05:14.396
You know, if he were here,

05:14.564 --> 05:16.898
I think he'd say,
"Enjoy Star Wars Day."

05:17.066 --> 05:20.444
He was 84.
He'd say, "Where's my pudding?"

05:22.238 --> 05:24.406
Before you go, at least
let me pack you some

05:24.574 --> 05:26.700
Attack of the Scones
for the road.

05:27.702 --> 05:29.953
Oh, like Attack of the Clones.

05:30.121 --> 05:32.080
We are leaving right now!

05:35.209 --> 05:37.002
Arthur passing away
was harder on Sheldon

05:37.170 --> 05:38.462
than he's ready to admit.

05:38.629 --> 05:39.838
Really hoping this will cheer him up.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.423
Me, too.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.050
Although, it might've been
thoughtless of us

05:43.217 --> 05:44.760
to bake a Death Star cake.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.930
No, it combines two of
Sheldon's favorite things:

05:49.098 --> 05:51.767
chocolate chips and the ability
to destroy a planet

05:51.934 --> 05:53.477
at the push of a button.

05:54.812 --> 05:56.938
Well, anyway, it'll be
a nice surprise for the boys.

05:57.106 --> 05:59.267
And Howie doesn't think
I take his interests seriously,

05:59.275 --> 06:01.610
so hopefully this will keep
him fooled for a while.

06:02.779 --> 06:05.614
OK, let's get the fondant
and start decorating.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.115
This is pretty cool.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.576
You don't see too many
spherical cakes.

06:13.456 --> 06:16.208
I wonder why that is.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.590
I have a confession to make.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.592
I've never been
to a funeral before.

06:25.760 --> 06:26.760
Really?

06:26.928 --> 06:29.638
I just never knew anyone that died.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.223
I had a pet pig
when I was a kid.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.517
I mean, when he died,
we didn't have a funeral,

06:33.684 --> 06:35.394
we had a barbecue.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.982
Yeah, we won't be
eating Arthur tonight.

06:44.070 --> 06:47.656
I didn't know him very well,
but I still really liked him.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.867
It's weird that he's... just gone.

06:51.035 --> 06:52.494
I know.

06:53.621 --> 06:54.913
I feel like I want to cry.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.915
Oh, that's... that's fine.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.417
Go ahead.

07:03.631 --> 07:05.111
I can't do it with you staring at me.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.550
Sorry.

07:11.681 --> 07:12.973
No, I'm dry.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.975
You're a big crybaby.
You start, I'll join in.

07:16.227 --> 07:18.019
I am not a crybaby.

07:18.187 --> 07:19.271
Toy Story 3?

07:19.439 --> 07:22.566
The toys were holding hands
in a furnace!

07:27.780 --> 07:30.282
Look, Arthur lived a full life.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.452
And he inspired a lot of people.

07:33.619 --> 07:37.372
Sure, he was
my childhood hero, but...

07:37.540 --> 07:40.125
...the fact that I got
to work with him,

07:40.293 --> 07:42.961
side by side, before he...

07:43.129 --> 07:45.755
...died was...

07:46.757 --> 07:49.009
It was a gift.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.052
It was a gift.

07:52.388 --> 07:56.016
Thank you for being the emotional one
in this relationship.

07:57.685 --> 08:00.896
- I got your back.
- Yeah.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.274
OK, here we go.

08:04.442 --> 08:07.235
The Phantom Menace.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.237
Let's get this over with.

08:09.405 --> 08:11.285
Since we all agree
Episode I isn't our favorite,

08:11.449 --> 08:12.741
maybe we just skip it this time.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.910
Yeah, Howard,
I think you of all people

08:15.077 --> 08:16.786
should avoid espousing
the principle

08:16.954 --> 08:18.455
that if something
is not our favorite,

08:18.623 --> 08:19.831
we should just get rid of it.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.754
You know, I heard this way
of watching the movies

08:25.922 --> 08:29.049
called the Machete Order,
where you watch Episodes IV and V,

08:29.217 --> 08:30.884
then skip Episode I,

08:31.052 --> 08:33.178
watch II and III as a flashback,

08:33.346 --> 08:34.763
and then finish with VI.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.932
OK, so you'd lose
most of Jar Jar,

08:37.099 --> 08:39.768
all the trade route talk,
and the boring senate hearings,

08:39.936 --> 08:42.437
which are like watching C-SPAN
with monsters.

08:43.940 --> 08:47.275
Get rid of the trade route part?
Then how would Palpatine

08:47.443 --> 08:50.278
get Chancellor Valorum
kicked out of office?

08:50.446 --> 08:52.197
How would he get
himself elected? How?

08:52.365 --> 08:54.115
Can we get through one holiday

08:54.283 --> 08:57.160
without you saying
something ridiculous?

08:57.286 --> 08:58.662
It was just a suggestion.

08:58.829 --> 09:00.914
Well, you know what else
was just a suggestion?

09:01.082 --> 09:03.833
"Why don't we change
the Raisin Bran box?"

09:03.960 --> 09:05.544
And you know
who got hurt by that?

09:05.711 --> 09:07.587
Every single person
who eats breakfast!

09:12.760 --> 09:16.388
I think he's taking this Professor
Proton thing pretty hard.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.807
Should we try to console him?

09:18.975 --> 09:24.145
Or... should we respect his privacy
in this moment of grief?

09:25.314 --> 09:27.107
By staying here
and watching the movie.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.484
That's what
good friends would do!

09:35.950 --> 09:37.117
Well, at least
without Sheldon here,

09:37.285 --> 09:39.619
we got to start with Episode IV.

09:39.787 --> 09:40.829
True.

09:44.041 --> 09:46.334
- I do feel guilty about him.
- Me, too.

09:46.502 --> 09:48.461
- Maybe we should see how he's doing.
- Yeah.

09:48.629 --> 09:51.965
- But after the cantina scene.
- Obviously.

09:58.139 --> 10:01.891
Look at Arthur,
cracking up at a joke I told him.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.689
I'll never hear
that laugh again.

10:07.857 --> 10:10.108
You never heard it that time.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.656
Arthur!

10:16.824 --> 10:18.241
I thought you were dead.

10:18.409 --> 10:19.534
I am.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.078
Oh, it's fantastic.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.708
I mean, this is the longest
that I've gone

10:26.876 --> 10:30.128
without running into a men's room

10:30.296 --> 10:32.255
in... in years.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.842
Why are you here?

10:36.010 --> 10:38.219
I don't know. I was...

10:38.387 --> 10:42.307
I was hoping I was going
to haunt my ex-wife.

10:44.268 --> 10:46.186
I know why.

10:46.354 --> 10:51.900
You've come to me because...
you're my Obi-Wan.

10:51.984 --> 10:54.903
I'm... I'm not...
I'm not familiar with that.

10:55.071 --> 10:58.031
Is... Is that an...

10:58.199 --> 11:00.575
...an Internet?

11:03.245 --> 11:06.998
Wow. You're dead,
so I'm going to let that slide.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.795
Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character
from Star Wars.

11:11.962 --> 11:15.090
After his physical demise,
he comes to Luke Skywalker

11:15.257 --> 11:17.842
as his mentor in spirit form.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.554
Well, that...
that clears that up.

11:24.058 --> 11:26.351
You must be here
to give me advice.

11:32.858 --> 11:34.776
Well, this... this is weird.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.279
Most-most of my robes open in...

11:38.447 --> 11:40.156
...in the back.

11:42.618 --> 11:44.911
Those are your Jedi robes.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.040
Wait. What...?

11:49.208 --> 11:51.418
What... what is this?

11:52.503 --> 11:54.045
Be careful with that!

11:54.964 --> 11:56.381
Whoa!

12:07.476 --> 12:09.144
Neato.

12:14.233 --> 12:17.902
I'm... I'm gonna need a Band-Aid.

12:22.158 --> 12:25.452
So... what did you think
of your first funeral?

12:25.619 --> 12:28.204
Well, I don't want to be a jerk,
but it was kind of a bummer.

12:30.040 --> 12:33.460
Yeah, well, when I die,
you can rent a bounce house.

12:34.962 --> 12:36.504
You think about dying?

12:36.672 --> 12:39.674
Well, I think more about
if I'd have any regrets.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.009
What would you regret?

12:41.177 --> 12:44.179
You know,
that I didn't travel more,

12:44.346 --> 12:46.848
take more risks,
learn another language.

12:47.016 --> 12:49.476
You know Klingon.

12:50.519 --> 12:53.229
- That's true.
- No, I meant that as a regret.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.486
I just thought of one more.

12:59.653 --> 13:01.070
What's that?

13:01.238 --> 13:04.824
I regret not saying "yes"
when you asked me to marry you.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.911
Well, it just wasn't the right time.

13:08.078 --> 13:09.913
Yeah.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.873
And this is also
not the right time.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.666
Do not propose.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.877
- What?
- I know that face.

13:16.045 --> 13:17.670
That's your propose face.

13:17.838 --> 13:20.799
I was not gonna propose.
It's already two to one.

13:20.966 --> 13:21.966
What's two to one?

13:22.134 --> 13:23.468
I proposed twice,
you proposed once. Two to one.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.220
Oh, my... It's not a contest.

13:25.387 --> 13:26.827
I don't know what
you're upset about.

13:26.889 --> 13:29.015
- I'm the one who's losing.
- OK.

13:29.183 --> 13:31.017
Fine. Would you feel
better if I propose

13:31.185 --> 13:32.560
so you could turn me down again?

13:32.728 --> 13:33.978
Yeah, I think I would.

13:34.146 --> 13:36.064
OK. Leonard,
will you marry me?

13:36.899 --> 13:37.899
Hm...

13:38.692 --> 13:40.235
No, don't you dare.

13:40.402 --> 13:42.403
You reject me right
now and tie things up.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.658
It's just such a big decision.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.535
I don't want to have any regrets.

13:53.207 --> 13:54.958
Did you ever watch Professor Proton
when you were a kid?

13:55.125 --> 13:57.460
No. My dad controlled the TV,

13:57.628 --> 13:59.337
so unless someone
was a Texas Ranger,

13:59.505 --> 14:03.091
Jake or the Fatman,
we didn't see it.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.540
I never watched him, either,
but he seems to be the reason

14:05.636 --> 14:07.345
that Sheldon got interested
in science.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.264
Not me. I got into science

14:09.431 --> 14:10.974
'cause I was always
the smallest kid in school,

14:11.141 --> 14:12.976
so I thought if I
became a scientist,

14:13.143 --> 14:15.895
I could invent a formula
that made me taller.

14:16.063 --> 14:17.605
That's cute.

14:17.773 --> 14:19.941
Yeah, I thought it was working
for a while,

14:20.109 --> 14:21.234
but then I found out
my brother was just

14:21.402 --> 14:23.361
lowering the pencil marks
on the door frame.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.906
How about you?

14:27.074 --> 14:30.451
Oh, I guess it must have been
back when I was in the Girl Sprouts.

14:32.162 --> 14:33.538
Girl Sprouts?

14:33.706 --> 14:36.791
My mom made it up as an
alternative to the Girl Scouts.

14:36.959 --> 14:41.462
She didn't want me selling cookies
on some street corner "like a whore."

14:45.050 --> 14:47.218
How did that get
you into science?

14:47.386 --> 14:49.971
Oh, I went to the library
and took out a book on biology

14:50.139 --> 14:52.098
to see what whores did.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.938
On the one hand, if I say yes...

14:59.106 --> 15:00.940
This isn't funny anymore.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.609
Just say no
so we're done with this.

15:02.776 --> 15:04.068
Will you marry me or not?

15:04.194 --> 15:08.156
Ooh, interesting. Did you just
propose to me again?

15:08.824 --> 15:09.866
No.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.285
Really? Because I just heard,
"Will you marry me?"

15:12.453 --> 15:15.455
That's two proposals, one day.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.784
Sounds like someone wants
to spend the rest of her life

15:17.875 --> 15:20.668
telling people how to spell
the name Hofstadter.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.881
You know what? Fine.
Do whatever you want.

15:25.591 --> 15:26.591
Hey.

15:26.717 --> 15:29.218
Penny, don't get upset.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.054
Here.

15:31.180 --> 15:35.016
I love you, but, no,
I will not marry you.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.643
Thank you.

15:36.810 --> 15:40.605
Now, about that second proposal.
On the one hand...

15:51.742 --> 15:54.953
Where... where... where are we?

15:55.704 --> 15:58.122
This is the swampland
of Dagobah.

15:58.290 --> 16:02.293
It's where Luke was trained
in the ways of the Jedi.

16:02.378 --> 16:06.631
Too bad.
I thought it was Florida.

16:12.513 --> 16:16.182
When Obi-Wan came to Luke
on this very spot,

16:16.350 --> 16:19.060
he gave him all sorts
of helpful advice.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.020
So, um...

16:22.231 --> 16:24.399
...what do you got for me?

16:25.859 --> 16:26.859
Um...

16:28.362 --> 16:30.405
Always...

16:30.531 --> 16:33.116
...get... get a prenup.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.663
That's it?

16:38.747 --> 16:41.916
I thought there'd be more
of a reason why you're here.

16:42.084 --> 16:45.545
Well, why do you think I'm here?

16:45.671 --> 16:49.132
I suppose it has something to do
with your recent passing.

16:49.299 --> 16:53.052
Is this the... the first time
you've lost, you know,

16:53.220 --> 16:54.595
someone close to you?

16:54.763 --> 16:57.098
Oh, no. No.

16:57.266 --> 17:01.352
I've already had to say good-bye
to 11 Dr. Whos.

17:03.272 --> 17:08.359
Yeah, I've... I've outlived
a few of my doctors, too.

17:09.153 --> 17:12.447
Of course, my grandfather
died when I was five.

17:12.614 --> 17:15.074
My father died when I was 14.

17:15.242 --> 17:18.119
I'm... I'm sorry about that.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.121
And now you're gone, too.

17:21.665 --> 17:24.709
It's like all the men I've
looked up to have gone away.

17:26.462 --> 17:30.131
Well, you know, it's...
it's OK to...

17:30.257 --> 17:31.799
...to be sad about them.

17:31.967 --> 17:36.721
Just... just make sure,
you know, you appreciate...

17:36.805 --> 17:39.307
...those who...
who are still there for you.

17:40.976 --> 17:43.102
But I do appreciate them.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.980
Well, then...

17:46.148 --> 17:50.068
...what am I doing in a swamp...

17:53.822 --> 17:56.699
...dressed like Friar Tuck?

18:02.998 --> 18:04.957
Appreciate them, Sheldon.

18:08.545 --> 18:09.754
Hey, buddy.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.839
Heard you're having a rough day.
You all right?

18:12.007 --> 18:13.466
I'm OK.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.552
How was the funeral?

18:18.514 --> 18:20.848
It was nice, you know.

18:21.016 --> 18:23.184
A lot of people showed up,

18:23.352 --> 18:26.187
told some great stories about him.

18:26.355 --> 18:29.816
Did you know that Arthur's son
is a high school sci...?

18:45.499 --> 18:47.416
Hey, the guys are about
to start Jedi.

18:47.584 --> 18:50.044
- You want to go watch?
- I do.

18:51.880 --> 18:55.258
After I make them go back and
watch one through five first.

18:57.886 --> 19:01.472
- Sheldon, that'll take us all night.
- That's true.

19:02.516 --> 19:05.935
It's a good thing I had a nap.

19:11.108 --> 19:13.109
Boy, some of the physical comedy
with Jar Jar

19:13.277 --> 19:15.444
is a little tough to watch.

19:17.322 --> 19:20.491
At least they toned him down
in the second one.

19:20.617 --> 19:22.827
Yeah, he is pretty stupid.

19:25.330 --> 19:28.249
Hey, we can say it. You can't.

19:30.460 --> 19:33.087
- Hey, guys.
- Happy Star Wars Day!

19:35.007 --> 19:36.549
A Death Star cake!

19:36.717 --> 19:38.397
Yeah, we were hoping
it might cheer you up.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.427
And even though it meant
we had to miss the movies,

19:40.429 --> 19:41.762
we could still be
part of the fun.

19:41.930 --> 19:44.010
Well, you didn't miss anything.
We just started over.

19:44.057 --> 19:45.766
Son of a bitch.

20:02.242 --> 20:03.576
You're back.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.703
Yeah, apparently...

20:05.871 --> 20:08.456
...I'm here whenever...
whenever you need me.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.374
That's nice.

20:11.627 --> 20:13.336
Maybe for you.

20:15.756 --> 20:18.132
Why do I need you now?

20:18.300 --> 20:20.635
Well, as near as I could tell,

20:20.802 --> 20:23.888
you fell asleep watching Star Wars,

20:24.056 --> 20:27.642
and now you're dreaming
you're watching Star Wars.

20:27.809 --> 20:29.393
So?

20:30.229 --> 20:32.438
I mean, don't you see
a problem there?

20:32.606 --> 20:37.193
I mean, how you're spending
your limited time on earth?

20:38.987 --> 20:40.404
Not at all.

20:41.740 --> 20:44.033
OK, good luck to you.
