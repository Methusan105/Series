WEBVTT

00:03.336 --> 00:06.422
Your pet name for me.

00:07.590 --> 00:09.883
Time's running out on this.
You need to make a decision.

00:10.051 --> 00:12.261
I submitted you a notarized list.

00:12.929 --> 00:15.889
I'm sorry, but "Gollum"
and "Flakey" are not acceptable.

00:16.474 --> 00:18.726
Well, you don't like
"Princess Corncob"

00:18.893 --> 00:22.062
you don't like "Fester,"
you're just impossible to please.

00:22.230 --> 00:23.647
We'll come back to that one.

00:24.065 --> 00:25.345
This brings us to the final item

00:25.442 --> 00:27.735
in our annual
State of the Relationship summit.

00:27.902 --> 00:30.571
Valentine's Day.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.741
Ohh! The worst for last.

00:34.951 --> 00:36.618
Classic Flakey.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.413
Before you get upset,

00:39.581 --> 00:41.331
I believe I've come up with
a way for us to celebrate

00:41.499 --> 00:43.083
the occasion that we both can enjoy.

00:43.251 --> 00:45.669
People usually start
a meeting with a joke,

00:45.837 --> 00:48.047
but you go ahead, end with one.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.258
I propose we spend a weekend

00:51.426 --> 00:53.218
at a bed-and-breakfast
in Napa Valley.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.929
I hate every word in that sentence.

00:57.640 --> 01:00.434
Including "in" "at," "we" and "a."

01:01.519 --> 01:03.020
Come on, Sheldon. Why not?

01:03.188 --> 01:05.731
For starters,
a bed-and-breakfast forces you

01:05.899 --> 01:08.859
- to eat with strangers at your table.
- One step ahead of you.

01:09.027 --> 01:10.736
Bernadette and Wolowitz
are going with us.

01:10.904 --> 01:13.280
Very well. What are
the sleeping arrangements?

01:13.448 --> 01:15.991
We've only been dating
for three years.

01:16.159 --> 01:18.952
If we were to share a room,
people might talk.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.497
I got you your own room.

01:21.664 --> 01:23.499
What if my room has
a claw-foot bathtub?

01:23.666 --> 01:26.586
It doesn't. I know it makes you feel
like you're bathing inside a monster.

01:28.213 --> 01:31.673
Look, I appreciate the effort,
but I'm still unclear

01:31.841 --> 01:35.010
how this trip is supposed
to be enjoyable for me.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.054
We're going to have
Valentine's Day dinner

01:37.222 --> 01:40.849
on a fully functioning vintage train.

01:41.017 --> 01:43.685
Vintage? Be specific.

01:43.853 --> 01:46.021
An Alcoa FA-4
diesel locomotive

01:46.189 --> 01:48.440
leading a train
of meticulously restored

01:48.608 --> 01:51.110
1915 Pullman first-class coaches.

01:51.569 --> 01:53.195
Wow.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.490
I'm feeling the urge to hug you.

01:57.700 --> 02:00.202
And one... and two...

02:00.370 --> 02:03.205
All right, Gollum, we're good.

02:29.357 --> 02:31.066
Are you sure you guys don't
want to come with us to Napa?

02:31.234 --> 02:32.442
You could probably still get a room.

02:32.610 --> 02:35.028
No, I think we're just gonna
have a quiet weekend at home.

02:35.196 --> 02:36.636
Plus, I'm not sure it's a great idea

02:36.739 --> 02:39.032
to take Penny
to where wine comes from.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.162
What? It's a joke.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.581
Oh, come on.
We bust on each other.

02:45.748 --> 02:47.875
I wear dorky glasses,
you might have a problem.

02:48.042 --> 02:49.751
It's all for laughs.

02:51.087 --> 02:54.006
That would really piss me off if
I didn't have a buzz going on.

02:57.844 --> 03:02.181
Howard, which pocket watch will you
be wearing for dinner on the train?

03:08.021 --> 03:09.271
I'm sorry, what?

03:10.190 --> 03:12.441
I'm afraid if we wear
the same pocket watch,

03:12.609 --> 03:14.193
it will be embarrassing.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.155
I don't own a pocket watch.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.657
Oh, my.

03:20.825 --> 03:24.453
Well, then my apologies
for bringing up this sore spot.

03:28.082 --> 03:30.042
Since you two are gonna be
around for Valentine's,

03:30.126 --> 03:31.406
would you mind
watching Cinnamon?

03:31.419 --> 03:33.503
You have Valentine's plans?

03:33.671 --> 03:36.423
Which came out sounding way
more surprised than I meant.

03:37.675 --> 03:39.301
Let me try that again.
You have Val...

03:39.469 --> 03:43.263
- See? I can't do it.
- I don't have plans,

03:43.431 --> 03:46.266
which is why I booked time
on the big telescope that night.

03:46.434 --> 03:49.394
Well, an evening looking at the
stars, that's still kind of romantic.

03:49.562 --> 03:50.812
Except I'll be alone.

03:50.980 --> 03:53.649
I'm trying to put lipstick
on a pig here. Work with me.

03:55.693 --> 03:57.254
- We'd be happy to watch Cinnamon.
- Yeah.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.280
Thank you. Oh, and I'd like
for at least one of us

03:59.322 --> 04:01.240
to see some action, so if you
guys happen to have sex,

04:01.407 --> 04:03.158
it's cool if she stays in the room.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.745
Same goes for the
two of you with Amy.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.593
What do you think, Sheldon?

04:21.761 --> 04:23.637
It's magnificent.

04:23.805 --> 04:26.139
This is going to be
the best Valentine's Day ever.

04:26.307 --> 04:28.016
I'm so glad you like it.

04:28.184 --> 04:29.851
I'm prepared to say I love it,

04:30.019 --> 04:32.688
as soon as I confirm there
are no hobos aboard.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.068
OK.

04:39.070 --> 04:41.029
Raj, I got it.

04:41.447 --> 04:42.739
Bye.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.285
That was your daddy.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.872
He wanted me to say that he misses...
Why am I doing this?

04:52.333 --> 04:54.209
Happy Valentine's Day!

04:54.377 --> 04:56.545
Flowers and chocolates?

04:56.713 --> 04:59.214
Somebody's trying
to get me out of my panties.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.759
Don't be surprised if you
find five chocolates missing

05:02.927 --> 05:04.970
and three gross coconut
ones with a bite taken out.

05:06.764 --> 05:08.682
It came that way when I bought it.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.976
Got you a little something, too.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.478
Oh, jewelry!

05:14.397 --> 05:17.149
Oh, my God. Lakers tickets?!

05:19.902 --> 05:21.486
It gets better. Instead of me,
you can take someone

05:21.654 --> 05:24.072
- who will actually enjoy it.
- Ohh!

05:24.365 --> 05:26.742
You are the best boyfriend ever.

05:26.909 --> 05:29.661
Thank you. Seriously,
please don't make me go.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.958
Should we take this little
party to the bedroom?

05:35.126 --> 05:37.210
Don't have to. We have
the whole place to ourselves.

05:37.378 --> 05:39.796
- That's true.
- In fact, if you want,

05:39.964 --> 05:42.424
we can do it right here
on Sheldon's spot.

05:44.594 --> 05:48.180
That is the least sexy thing
anyone's ever said to me.

05:49.265 --> 05:51.266
- To the bedroom!
- Yeah!

05:56.397 --> 05:59.441
And for the entrГ©e, tonight's
special is a seafood risotto.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.902
- Do you have any questions?
- I do.

06:02.070 --> 06:05.947
Does this train car have
the original link-and-pin coupler

06:06.115 --> 06:08.116
or the Miller Hook and platform?

06:09.327 --> 06:11.203
I'm sorry, I meant
questions about the food.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.080
Oh, of course.

06:13.247 --> 06:16.208
Is the seafood risotto being
served on a train car

06:16.376 --> 06:17.856
with the original
link-and-pin coupler

06:17.919 --> 06:19.544
or the Miller Hook and platform?

06:21.464 --> 06:23.298
I think we're gonna
need a minute.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.844
It's neither.

06:29.472 --> 06:32.808
They actually use
the AAR type "E" coupler.

06:32.975 --> 06:35.310
If you listen carefully when
the locomotive disconnects,

06:35.478 --> 06:38.063
you'll hear the characteristic
click, whoosh,

06:38.189 --> 06:40.023
...thunk of the knuckle.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.653
Get out of town.

06:46.531 --> 06:49.282
I'm gonna jump off this train.

06:53.788 --> 06:57.165
Hey, Cinnamon,
guess who just did it human style.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.044
Oh, my God!

07:01.212 --> 07:02.692
It's a little late, but I'll take it.

07:04.132 --> 07:07.259
No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates.
That's really bad for dogs.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.428
Oh, crap.
What are we gonna do?

07:09.595 --> 07:11.035
We gotta get her to a vet right now.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.348
I don't have a vet.
I have a podiatrist,

07:13.516 --> 07:16.518
an optometrist, an allergist,
a dermatologist, a urologist.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.353
You'd think I'd have a vet.

07:19.021 --> 07:20.382
OK. There's one not far from here.

07:20.398 --> 07:21.523
- Come on. Let's go.
- OK.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.484
Koothrappali was right.
We should have let her watch.

07:27.905 --> 07:30.657
Do another one, do another one!

07:30.825 --> 07:33.201
OK. Here's my impression
of the Amtrak Acela

07:33.369 --> 07:35.579
barreling down the Eastern Corridor.

07:43.754 --> 07:46.590
It's like there's a train
in your mouth.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.342
Oh, yeah. I've got one.

07:49.510 --> 07:52.554
The Amtrak Wolverine
coming into Chicago.

08:02.064 --> 08:05.233
I've been on that train.
And I just was again.

08:07.570 --> 08:08.970
See if you guys can guess this one:

08:09.071 --> 08:11.490
Bang! Splat! Thud.

08:14.118 --> 08:15.827
How many trains
have you been on?

08:15.995 --> 08:19.581
Tons. A box fell on my
head at UPS six years ago.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.334
Now I just collect disability
and ride trains.

08:24.045 --> 08:27.255
Wow. Your life's amazing.

08:28.257 --> 08:31.927
Not always. A box fell on my
head at UPS six years ago.

08:32.094 --> 08:35.180
Now I just collect disability
and ride trains.

08:40.269 --> 08:43.563
- Why do I even try?
- I'm gonna fix this right now.

08:43.731 --> 08:46.066
OK. Just make it
look like an accident.

08:49.445 --> 08:52.948
Excuse me. You are at Valentine's
dinner with your girlfriend.

08:53.115 --> 08:56.034
Now get back over there
and be with her.

08:57.119 --> 08:59.788
You're right.
That was insensitive of me.

09:00.915 --> 09:02.666
I have to go back to my table now.

09:02.833 --> 09:04.626
- You should join us.
- All right.

09:06.963 --> 09:10.173
Great. Now there's two of 'em.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.182
- How much chocolate did she eat?
- A whole box.

09:19.350 --> 09:22.394
Well, to be fair, you ate a lot of it
before you gave it to me.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.647
So the point is I may
have saved her life.

09:27.942 --> 09:29.985
I'm sorry, is this a joke to you?

09:30.152 --> 09:31.611
No.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.280
Maybe to her.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.325
How big a box of chocolate was it?

09:37.493 --> 09:39.160
Something like this. I don't know.

09:39.328 --> 09:41.246
It came free with a full tank of gas.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.868
Really? Do you know how much
those Lakers tickets were?

09:45.001 --> 09:46.835
- Do you know how much gas is?
- Hey!

09:47.587 --> 09:49.004
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.924
Oh, my God, Cinnamon,
are you OK?!

09:53.092 --> 09:54.759
I can't believe you two!

09:54.927 --> 09:56.567
You do whatever it takes
to save her life.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.596
If she needs new organs,
I'll buy any dog necessary

09:58.681 --> 10:00.473
and scrap them for parts!

10:02.018 --> 10:04.853
- You're the owner?
- Owner, father, soul mate,

10:05.021 --> 10:07.856
and if anything happens to her,
your worst nightmare!

10:10.526 --> 10:12.902
Well, she's not throwing up,
which is a good sign.

10:13.070 --> 10:15.447
So, I'm gonna take her in back,
put her on fluids

10:15.615 --> 10:17.335
and give her something
to absorb the toxins.

10:17.366 --> 10:18.867
OK. OK, thank you.

10:19.035 --> 10:22.370
If she's scared, you can sing to her.
She likes Katy Perry.

10:23.205 --> 10:25.790
But don't do "Firework"
That gets her all riled up.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.168
Got it.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.337
Should have been a dentist.

10:32.298 --> 10:36.217
OK, what was the best four-ten-four
US locomotive ever built?

10:36.385 --> 10:38.511
Trick question.
There never was one.

10:38.679 --> 10:41.890
- Or was there?
- What?!

10:43.809 --> 10:47.020
In 1944, the Pacific Railroad
built number 6131,

10:47.188 --> 10:48.938
which rearranged
the drivers and cylinders,

10:49.106 --> 10:50.899
solving the problem of the Q-1,

10:51.067 --> 10:52.859
creating a duplex-drive
four-four-six-four.

10:53.027 --> 10:56.738
In what world is a
four-four-six-four a four-ten-four?

10:56.906 --> 10:58.448
A world I don't want to live in!

11:00.576 --> 11:02.577
Seriously, I no longer want
to live in this world.

11:04.163 --> 11:07.248
Hold on to your conductor's hat.
You crank the second and third axles,

11:07.416 --> 11:09.584
creating a pair of
internal connecting rods,

11:09.752 --> 11:12.671
and boom! Four-ten-four.
If you think about it,

11:12.838 --> 11:15.215
the Q-2 was like the four-ten-four
America never made.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.926
I may never stop thinking about it.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.428
Amy, what are the odds
we run into this guy?

11:20.596 --> 11:22.055
Better than you think.

11:25.434 --> 11:28.269
You know, if you ask nicely, they'll
let you visit the engine room.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.731
I never want this day to end.

11:31.899 --> 11:33.483
It's feeling like it never will.

11:35.111 --> 11:36.403
Come on.

11:37.196 --> 11:40.073
Hey, did I tell you what
happened to me at UPS?

11:42.827 --> 11:46.413
As if Valentine's Day wasn't bad
enough, you try to kill my dog?!

11:46.580 --> 11:48.581
And with cheap chocolate, no less?

11:48.749 --> 11:51.668
It wasn't cheap.
It was free.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.629
We're really sorry.
It was an accident.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.381
Yeah, we weren't even out
of the room that long.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.842
No, come on. It was a while.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.137
It was a while.

12:04.682 --> 12:07.350
- Is Cinnamon gonna be OK?
- She's responding well.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.978
We just want to keep her
a little longer for observation.

12:10.146 --> 12:12.439
All right. Would it be OK
for me to see her?

12:12.606 --> 12:15.483
We're usually in bed by now,
and I want her to know that I'm here.

12:16.861 --> 12:19.279
Yes, we sleep together,
and sometimes we spoon.

12:22.116 --> 12:23.867
It's OK. I sleep with my dog, too.

12:25.035 --> 12:27.078
We're not supposed
to let people in back, but...

12:27.246 --> 12:28.705
...I think I can make an exception.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.707
- Thank you.
- Come on.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.544
- By the way, I sang her Katy Perry.
- Oh, yeah?

12:34.712 --> 12:38.506
And I don't care what that obnoxious
parrot back there says. I crushed it.

12:39.925 --> 12:42.245
I think there's something going
on between the two of them.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.763
Maybe, but you also think
nine minutes isn't a while,

12:44.930 --> 12:46.222
so what do you know?

12:53.898 --> 12:55.982
- You OK?
- Why?

12:56.150 --> 12:59.235
Because my boyfriend's off
playing choo-choo with some weirdo?

13:00.529 --> 13:03.740
Well, to be fair,
they're both weirdos.

13:05.034 --> 13:07.035
I don't know what made me think
tonight would be any different.

13:07.203 --> 13:10.580
Well, just the fact that you got
him up here still says a lot.

13:10.748 --> 13:13.068
To be honest, I bet Howie 200
bucks it wasn't gonna happen.

13:13.209 --> 13:16.211
I'm going to the LEGO store
to get a big-ass R2-D2.

13:20.257 --> 13:22.801
See? It's not just Sheldon.
They're all idiots.

13:25.012 --> 13:26.471
She's right.

13:27.556 --> 13:30.058
So your boyfriend's a fixer-upper.
Most of them are.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.560
I mean, look at this guy.
You think he came like this?

13:32.728 --> 13:34.896
When I met him,
he was a hot, goofy mess.

13:36.607 --> 13:38.733
Now, he's been to space.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.652
That's all me.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.865
- I had a little to do with it.
- Oh, sure you did.

13:46.033 --> 13:48.409
Who's Mama's big space man?

13:50.830 --> 13:52.497
I am.

13:59.213 --> 14:00.588
They've been in there,
like, half an hour.

14:00.756 --> 14:03.591
Yeah, for future reference,
that's a while.

14:08.347 --> 14:11.099
- How long should we stay?
- I don't know. I'm kind of hungry.

14:11.267 --> 14:14.644
- I saw a Thai place next door.
- OK.

14:16.730 --> 14:18.940
- How's she doing?
- How is everything?

14:19.108 --> 14:20.984
She's gonna be OK.
They're gonna let me take her home.

14:21.151 --> 14:22.193
Good.

14:22.361 --> 14:23.528
So I want you to keep
a close eye on her

14:23.696 --> 14:24.863
for the next 24 hours.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.407
Here are a few warning
signs to look out for.

14:27.575 --> 14:30.118
If you see any of them,
don't hesitate to call.

14:30.286 --> 14:33.121
Thank you for taking such
good care of my little girl.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.206
My pleasure.
Have a nice night.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.041
Yes, thank you for all your help.

14:37.209 --> 14:39.168
Yeah. I'm sorry if you didn't think
we were taking it seriously.

14:39.336 --> 14:41.921
- We love animals.
- Do you guys own any pets?

14:42.089 --> 14:44.632
- No.
- Good.

14:51.682 --> 14:53.516
I love you so much.

14:53.684 --> 14:55.101
I love you, too.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.445
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

15:06.238 --> 15:08.031
You guys missed
a pretty great time.

15:08.198 --> 15:11.367
The conductor and I have
the same pocket watch.

15:13.329 --> 15:16.497
- It was crazy.
- Dare I say "loco?"

15:17.541 --> 15:18.958
Oh, and, Amy, guess what?

15:19.126 --> 15:20.967
The conductor said as
soon as he gets off work,

15:21.045 --> 15:24.297
he can come back to the bed and
breakfast and play his banjo for us.

15:25.841 --> 15:29.344
OK. I need to speak to my boyfriend
in private, like, right now.

15:29.511 --> 15:32.472
There's a car with a glass roof.
Want to go look at the stars?

15:32.640 --> 15:36.017
- That sounds so romantic.
- Give it a rest!

15:37.311 --> 15:38.770
Let's go.

15:42.858 --> 15:45.443
- Why are you still here?
- Excuse me.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.320
I think you're being a little rude.

15:47.488 --> 15:50.198
I'm being rude? You've been
rude to me this entire evening.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.908
How is that possible?

15:52.076 --> 15:55.203
I've hardly spoken
to you since we got on the train.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.374
I'm detecting a little
friction between you two,

15:59.541 --> 16:01.668
and I don't want to be a third rail.

16:02.544 --> 16:03.878
Get it?

16:04.797 --> 16:06.047
I get it.

16:08.342 --> 16:09.717
Leave!

16:11.512 --> 16:14.222
- What is your problem?
- It's Valentine's Day.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.265
We're supposed to be
having a romantic weekend.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.935
Oh, really?
Because I remember you saying

16:19.103 --> 16:21.270
that this trip was going to be
something we could both enjoy.

16:21.438 --> 16:24.565
Did you mean that,
or were you just trying to trick me?

16:25.359 --> 16:28.903
Fine, it's true.
I deserve romance,

16:29.071 --> 16:31.572
and I didn't know how
else to make it happen.

16:32.408 --> 16:36.619
Well, if you want romance,
then let's have romance!

16:36.787 --> 16:39.205
Oh, look, there's wine. Mm!

16:40.541 --> 16:42.959
Grape juice that burns.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.920
Now let's gaze
into each other's eyes.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.297
- You blinked. I win.
- Sheldon...

16:48.465 --> 16:50.925
Let's see. What's next?
Kissing's romantic.

17:09.278 --> 17:10.778
That was nice.

17:12.489 --> 17:14.032
Good.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.785
Um...

17:18.412 --> 17:21.831
The conductor said if I come
back to the engine room,

17:21.999 --> 17:25.460
he'd show me how to bring
the train through a crossing.

17:27.379 --> 17:29.464
OK, have fun.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.885
Do you want to come with me?

17:34.053 --> 17:36.471
Really? I do.

17:40.601 --> 17:41.934
Hey, guys, wait up!

17:49.109 --> 17:53.029
There you go. All cozy wozy.

17:54.656 --> 17:58.993
Here, let's see what the doctor
says to keep an eye out for.

18:00.579 --> 18:03.164
Hm. "Rajesh, I was
dreading Valentine's Day.

18:03.332 --> 18:06.834
Thank you for spending it
with me. Yvette."

18:08.504 --> 18:12.548
Cinnamon, she gave me
her phone number.

18:12.716 --> 18:14.008
If I'd known it was that easy,
I would have considered

18:14.176 --> 18:15.968
poisoning you months ago.

18:18.305 --> 18:19.472
Oh, what should I say?

18:19.640 --> 18:21.099
Oh, I know.

18:21.266 --> 18:24.393
I'll point out her name's Yvette,
and that she's a vet.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.145
That's hysterical.

18:26.313 --> 18:27.688
She'll love it.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.401
- Hello.
- Hey. You're back.

18:32.569 --> 18:34.695
- How was your trip?
- It was wonderful!

18:34.863 --> 18:37.365
- Great. What did you do?
- I made a new friend

18:37.533 --> 18:39.367
who likes trains
as much as I do,

18:39.535 --> 18:41.119
I kissed Amy on the lips,

18:41.286 --> 18:44.122
and the conductor played his
banjo for me.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.706
Good night.

18:45.874 --> 18:49.043
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm gonna need more details.

18:49.211 --> 18:51.629
Well, my new
friend's name was Eric.

18:51.797 --> 18:55.383
Amy lips tasted like
the brownie we had for dessert.

18:56.635 --> 18:59.137
The banjo-playing
conductor was missing a finger,

18:59.304 --> 19:01.472
but he made up for it
with his can-do attitude.

19:02.558 --> 19:06.519
No, hang on. Hang on.
Are all those things equal to you?

19:06.687 --> 19:08.104
Hmm...

19:08.397 --> 19:10.565
It never occurred to me
to pick a favorite.

19:10.732 --> 19:12.859
Well, give it a go.

19:14.611 --> 19:17.697
I can't answer that without
collecting additional data.

19:18.782 --> 19:21.117
Additional data. You dog!

19:22.953 --> 19:25.538
I'm not sure how listening
to other nine-fingered banjo players

19:25.706 --> 19:27.707
makes me dog, but all right.
