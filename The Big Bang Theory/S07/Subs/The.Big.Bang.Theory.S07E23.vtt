WEBVTT

00:03.920 --> 00:05.713
Almost there.
You're doing great.

00:05.880 --> 00:09.133
Thanks for lifting my spirits.
Next time, try lifting the box.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.177
Please hurry.

00:12.345 --> 00:14.013
I don't need a treadmill!

00:14.180 --> 00:16.807
The doctor says you need
to get exercise!

00:16.975 --> 00:19.226
I get plenty of exercise!

00:19.394 --> 00:22.438
Crushing my will
to live isn't exercise!

00:23.857 --> 00:25.977
If she isn't gonna use it,
then why are we doing this?

00:26.067 --> 00:28.110
She'll use it.
All I need is to rig it

00:28.278 --> 00:31.196
with a fishing pole
and a HoneyBaked ham.

00:31.364 --> 00:32.448
All right.

00:32.615 --> 00:33.949
Now what?

00:34.117 --> 00:36.758
- We set it up in Howie's old room.
- Do you know how to set it up?

00:36.911 --> 00:40.289
Please, I'm an MIT-trained engineer.
I think I can handle...

00:40.457 --> 00:41.915
Ma, look out!

00:44.794 --> 00:47.755
I told you this thing would kill me!

01:14.824 --> 01:17.701
So she's gonna be laid up
for at least six weeks.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.161
Poor Mrs. Wolowitz.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.330
Should we do something for her?

01:21.498 --> 01:24.124
I know. Let's go see
the new Spider-Man movie.

01:26.544 --> 01:29.088
Sheldon, we're talking about
your friend's mother. She got hurt.

01:29.255 --> 01:33.425
I thought that subject had run
its course, so I changed it.

01:33.593 --> 01:36.261
It's called reading the room, Amy.

01:37.388 --> 01:39.056
- Hi.
- Hey, how were things on the set?

01:39.224 --> 01:40.808
Pretty good, actually.

01:40.975 --> 01:42.726
So the movie's
not as bad as you thought?

01:42.894 --> 01:45.687
Oh, no, it is, but I decided,
instead of complaining about it,

01:45.855 --> 01:47.815
I'm just gonna go in
every day and give it my all.

01:47.857 --> 01:48.899
- Good for you.
- Thanks.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.151
There's no reason
why I shouldn't be the best

01:51.319 --> 01:53.612
bisexual go-go dancer
slowly transforming

01:53.780 --> 01:56.532
into a killer gorilla
anyone's ever seen.

01:57.992 --> 02:00.869
I don't know. The bisexual gorilla
go-go dancer in Schindler's List

02:01.037 --> 02:02.037
is tough to beat.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.540
Ah, very good.

02:04.707 --> 02:07.584
Because a gorilla go-go dancer
of any sexual preference

02:07.752 --> 02:10.003
would be out of place in a film
about the Holocaust.

02:11.714 --> 02:13.674
It only gets funnier
when you explain it, Sheldon.

02:14.926 --> 02:16.426
I know.

02:21.057 --> 02:23.725
Okay, she's all settled in the guest room.

02:23.893 --> 02:26.574
Maybe we should get one of those
machines to help her up the stairs.

02:26.729 --> 02:28.272
You mean a forklift?

02:30.316 --> 02:31.525
- Howie...
- I'm sorry.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.443
I just can't deal
with this right now.

02:33.611 --> 02:35.779
Taking care of your own mother?
How can you say that?

02:35.947 --> 02:38.574
Bernie, she's gonna be off her feet
for six to eight weeks.

02:38.741 --> 02:42.411
Are you prepared to feed her,
wash her and take her to the toilet?

02:43.037 --> 02:46.081
- I would do it for my mother.
- Yeah, of course you would.

02:46.249 --> 02:47.916
You're a loving person.

02:48.084 --> 02:50.919
I'm what my people would call a putz.

02:53.298 --> 02:56.508
Look, I'm not crazy about the idea,
but what other choice do we have?

02:56.676 --> 02:59.803
We get a nurse. Preferably someone
from a third world country

02:59.971 --> 03:02.931
who's used to suffering
and unpleasant smells.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.269
You'd hire a total stranger
to take care

03:07.437 --> 03:09.354
of the woman who raised you?
That's so cruel.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.648
Not if we pay them well

03:11.816 --> 03:14.651
and let them listen
to the music of their homeland.

03:16.112 --> 03:18.947
I need to tinkle!

03:19.115 --> 03:21.366
Sounds like the job
for a loving person.

03:23.536 --> 03:26.456
Would you liike me to play Polish music
while you carry her to the toilet?

03:28.416 --> 03:30.209
You are a putz.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.795
As advertised.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.634
Thanks for coming with me.

03:38.801 --> 03:41.428
Thanks for inviting me
after everyone else said no.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.265
Aren't you gonna get 3-D glasses?

03:45.433 --> 03:47.017
I brought my own.

03:47.185 --> 03:51.146
No sense in risking
bridge-of-nose herpes.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.482
Is that a real thing?

03:53.650 --> 03:58.278
Well, until they invent
nose condoms, I'm not finding out.

04:00.615 --> 04:02.324
Emily! Hey!

04:02.492 --> 04:04.368
Oh, hey, Raj.

04:04.535 --> 04:06.787
This is my friend, Sheldon.
Sheldon, this is Emily.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.873
Oh, yes, you're the dermatologist.

04:10.917 --> 04:14.002
I went for a walk yesterday
without sunscreen.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.756
Do you see anything on my forehead

04:17.924 --> 04:20.425
that I should be concerned about?

04:22.095 --> 04:24.805
Um, you know what? I better go.
My movie's about to start.

04:24.973 --> 04:27.140
- Are you here alone?
- No, not really.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.868
- What do you mean, "not really"?
- Hey, should we get our seats?

04:29.978 --> 04:33.522
Yeah. It was nice seeing you.
I'll call you later.

04:33.690 --> 04:34.690
Yeah, okay.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.112
That was awkward, right?

04:43.616 --> 04:46.451
Is it because she's dating you
but was out with that other fellow?

04:46.619 --> 04:47.828
- Yes.
- Good.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.676
I thought she saw
something on my forehead.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.002
And... action.

04:55.169 --> 04:58.088
- Please don't shut me out.
- Go away.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.174
Just go away.

05:02.051 --> 05:04.594
I swear, I will find
a way to turn you back.

05:04.762 --> 05:09.057
What gave you the right to mix my DNA
with that of a killer gorilla?

05:10.727 --> 05:12.602
I was trying to save your life.

05:12.770 --> 05:15.731
Life? What life?
Look at me! I'm a monster!

05:15.898 --> 05:19.860
And now I have blood on my hands,
or paws. I don't know.

05:22.780 --> 05:25.907
You can't give up.
I love you.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.037
I love you too.

05:30.204 --> 05:33.081
But I'm afraid I love killing more.

05:33.249 --> 05:35.584
Like, one day,
I might actually try and kill you!

05:38.546 --> 05:40.756
And... cut.
All right.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.149
All right,
let's set up for the next scene.

05:46.220 --> 05:48.388
Actually, know what?
Can we do one more?

05:49.557 --> 05:50.724
I think I could do it better.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.851
Let's just move on.
No one cares.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.354
Well, I care.
I mean, look, if we're gonna do this,

05:55.480 --> 05:58.357
why not try and make it
something we're actually proud of?

06:01.444 --> 06:04.988
Look, sweetie, this movie is garbage,
but you should be happy about that,

06:05.156 --> 06:07.741
'cause if it was a good movie,
you wouldn't be in it.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.661
Whoa, whoa, hang on.
There's no need to insult her.

06:11.829 --> 06:13.622
- And who are you?
- I'm her boyfriend.

06:13.790 --> 06:17.042
- Isn't she too hot for you?
- A little, yeah.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.044
Well, boyfriend, get off my set.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.670
You can't do that.
He's with me.

06:20.838 --> 06:22.798
You know what? You can get off
my set, too. You're fired.

06:22.965 --> 06:24.966
What? You can't fire me.
I'm the star.

06:25.134 --> 06:28.637
I'm the girl that goes bananas.
It says so on the poster.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.205
Yeah, but we just shot the last scene
where we see your face.

06:31.557 --> 06:36.520
So from now own, the star
of the movie is whoever wears this.

06:38.147 --> 06:41.650
Hey, if you're gonna fire her,
then you have to fire me too.

06:41.818 --> 06:45.362
Wow, that fell apart really fast.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.160
Thanks for skipping the movie.

06:52.328 --> 06:54.329
I couldn't sit in that theater
for two hours

06:54.497 --> 06:56.289
wondering about Emily and that guy.

06:56.457 --> 06:58.333
Oh, quite all right.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.585
After my forehead melanoma scare,

07:00.753 --> 07:03.255
I've learned not to sweat
the small stuff.

07:04.841 --> 07:08.802
Well, sorry, I don't have all
the ingredients to make chai tea.

07:08.970 --> 07:11.263
- You don't have to make me anything.
- No, I do.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.515
You're upset about Emily
and you're Indian.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.475
I need to make you chai tea.

07:16.269 --> 07:20.522
Now, I have all the ingredients
except cardamom seeds.

07:21.482 --> 07:23.692
Do you happen to have any on you?

07:25.194 --> 07:27.195
Sorry, I left them in my turban.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.409
Oh, I'll make English breakfast tea.

07:32.577 --> 07:34.870
They destroyed your culture.
That's close enough.

07:38.541 --> 07:41.209
You know, I'm curious,

07:41.377 --> 07:44.087
why are you so upset
about seeing Emily with another man?

07:44.255 --> 07:47.215
Wouldn't you be upset if you saw
Amy out with someone else?

07:47.383 --> 07:50.719
Can't happen. We have an ironclad
relationship agreement

07:50.887 --> 07:54.681
which precludes her from physical
contact with anyone other than me.

07:55.558 --> 07:57.934
But you don't have sex
with her either.

07:58.102 --> 08:00.520
Slick, huh?

08:02.023 --> 08:04.191
To be truthful,
Emily and I haven't dated that long,

08:04.358 --> 08:06.318
and we never agreed
to be exclusive to each other.

08:06.402 --> 08:07.694
Have you had intercourse?

08:07.862 --> 08:08.862
No.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.573
Well, stick to your guns.
There will be a lot of pressure.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.540
I'm hungry again!

08:22.919 --> 08:25.754
It's like the world's
fattest cuckoo clock.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.286
You know, you're always talking
about having a baby someday.

08:32.428 --> 08:35.597
- This is exactly what it'll be like.
- No, it's not.

08:35.765 --> 08:40.268
Come on. The constant fussing,
eating, pooping, burping, drooling.

08:40.436 --> 08:43.563
We're even waiting for the day
when she can finally walk on her own.

08:45.001 --> 08:46.001
Maybe you're right.

08:46.025 --> 08:49.152
Anything she finds on the floor
goes right in her mouth.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.535
I'm just telling you now,
if we do have kids,

08:56.702 --> 08:59.037
don't expect me to do all the work.

08:59.205 --> 09:02.165
Hey, I'm a very paternal person.

09:02.333 --> 09:05.001
I'd be excellent
at taking care of a baby.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.629
I'm still hungry!

09:07.797 --> 09:09.214
I'm coming, you big baby!

09:15.012 --> 09:17.138
You know, the only thing
worse than doing a movie

09:17.306 --> 09:19.140
where they glue monkey hair
to your ass

09:19.308 --> 09:23.144
is getting fired from a movie where
they glue monkey hair to your ass.

09:25.606 --> 09:28.483
Forget it, man, it's crap.
You just move on to the next thing.

09:28.651 --> 09:32.279
Yeah, well, it's easy for you to say.
You used to be famous.

09:32.989 --> 09:35.323
Hey. I just lost a job for you.

09:35.491 --> 09:37.576
You're right,
I'm sorry, you're famous.

09:39.120 --> 09:42.372
Penny, it's not about being famous.
It's about the art.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.416
It's about the passion
we have for our craft.

09:47.128 --> 09:49.629
I have an audition
for Sharknado 2!

09:49.797 --> 09:52.237
If I book this, I am totally gonna
pay you back for this beer.

09:56.387 --> 09:58.763
God, what am I doing with my life?

09:58.931 --> 10:00.515
You having second
thoughts about acting?

10:00.683 --> 10:02.434
You were on set,
you saw what it was like.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.769
Yeah, but it's not always that bad.

10:04.937 --> 10:05.937
Oh, really?

10:06.063 --> 10:09.232
What about when you did Anne Frank
at that cute little theater?

10:09.442 --> 10:11.568
It was over a bowling alley.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.237
Yeah, but...

10:14.947 --> 10:16.698
...there was ample parking.

10:18.367 --> 10:19.492
Are you done?

10:19.660 --> 10:21.536
And you were so good
in the TV commercial.

10:21.704 --> 10:24.539
It was for hemorrhoid cream.

10:24.707 --> 10:28.585
And I got itchy and swollen
just watching you.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.090
Leonard, you are really
not cheering me up.

10:34.258 --> 10:36.593
Come on. How can you be sad
when you're going home

10:36.761 --> 10:39.929
with all five-foot-six of this?

10:40.723 --> 10:42.849
You think you're five-foot-six,
that's funny.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.480
I don't understand it.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.857
I'm a nice guy, I have a great job,

10:51.025 --> 10:54.194
I'm well-educated,
come from a good family...

10:54.362 --> 10:56.029
Why don't women want to be with me?

10:57.239 --> 10:59.366
An interesting question.

11:00.785 --> 11:03.119
Well... good night.

11:04.372 --> 11:08.375
What? Don't send me home.
I can't be alone right now.

11:08.542 --> 11:11.419
That's your problem.
You can't be alone.

11:11.587 --> 11:12.879
What do you mean?

11:15.299 --> 11:17.300
How many women
have you had dates with?

11:18.928 --> 11:19.928
Eleven.

11:20.096 --> 11:24.140
How many of those women did you think
would become your perfect companion?

11:26.018 --> 11:27.644
Eleven.

11:27.812 --> 11:30.522
Wait. Do I count the 200-pound
Sailor Moon girl

11:30.690 --> 11:33.316
that Howard and I had
a threesome with at Comic-Con?

11:36.612 --> 11:37.987
Sure.

11:39.156 --> 11:42.283
I'll stick with 11.
She liked Howard better.

11:44.620 --> 11:46.496
Well, now do you see the problem?

11:48.124 --> 11:51.042
Maybe. I...
I don't know.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.878
It's late, I... I should...
I should go.

11:58.592 --> 12:00.635
Look, I do get what you're saying.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.722
Instead of desperately clinging
to any woman who will go out with me,

12:03.889 --> 12:06.057
I need to work
on my fear of being alone.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.853
I was trying to suggest
chemical castration, but...

12:13.149 --> 12:16.109
...it's my bedtime, so whatever
gets you out the door. Good night.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.198
Howie, I'm back!

12:23.242 --> 12:24.492
I just got her to sleep.

12:24.660 --> 12:25.785
Sorry.

12:25.953 --> 12:28.496
What took you so long?
The grocery store's a few blocks away.

12:28.664 --> 12:30.915
They only had regular yogurt.
I had to go to a different store

12:31.083 --> 12:33.585
to get the extra-fat kind
your mom likes.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.755
Then why do I smell coffee
on your breath?

12:36.922 --> 12:39.382
So what? After two days
of taking care of her,

12:39.550 --> 12:41.468
excuse me for stopping
to get a mocha.

12:41.635 --> 12:45.638
A mocha?
Well, it must be nice to be queen.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.058
Queen?
I've been killing myself here!

12:49.226 --> 12:51.102
Well, whose fault is that? I wanted
to get a nurse, but you were all,

12:51.270 --> 12:54.022
"I'm nice. I want to take care of people."

12:56.317 --> 12:59.694
I'm glad I got that mocha.
And you know what else I'm glad about?

12:59.862 --> 13:03.740
I bought you a brownie
and I ate it in the car!

13:06.243 --> 13:09.037
Howard!

13:09.205 --> 13:11.748
Thanks a lot.
Now I have to go rub her belly again.

13:20.549 --> 13:22.634
- Hey.
- Thanks for letting me come over.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.178
Of course.
Please, come in.

13:27.389 --> 13:30.975
I just wanted to say how sorry
I am about tonight, and...

13:31.393 --> 13:33.186
...I want to make sure that we're okay.

13:34.021 --> 13:36.564
Look, you and I haven't made
any commitments to each other.

13:36.732 --> 13:39.609
I know.
I just felt like I needed to explain.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.319
The guy I was
with did my last tattoo,

13:41.487 --> 13:43.363
and he's been
asking me out for months.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.907
I finally said yes
just to get it over with.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.201
- It's okay.
- Really?

13:48.369 --> 13:50.912
Well, I mean, yeah,
it freaked me out a little,

13:51.080 --> 13:53.456
but that's my issue, not yours.

13:54.416 --> 13:55.917
Wow.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.920
If I saw you out with another woman,
I'd be pretty upset.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.588
Thank you.

14:03.050 --> 14:06.302
Not just for being upset,
but for believing that could happen.

14:09.932 --> 14:12.392
Just so you know,
I'm not seeing anyone else.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.561
Well, me neither.

14:15.271 --> 14:16.855
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.731
Please.

14:18.899 --> 14:22.694
- So, you... You have tattoos?
- Yeah.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.445
I don't.

14:25.364 --> 14:28.783
I have a hole in my belly button that
may or may not have been a piercing.

14:29.827 --> 14:32.829
- That's cool.
- It's a piercing.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.583
So... how many tattoos?

14:37.626 --> 14:40.211
One on my shoulder,
one not on my shoulder

14:40.379 --> 14:43.464
and one really not on my shoulder.

14:46.093 --> 14:49.512
It's, uh... been a long time
since I've seen a girl's...

14:50.014 --> 14:52.015
...really not her shoulder.

14:54.184 --> 14:55.184
Well...

14:55.644 --> 14:57.645
...how about you show me
your piercing

14:57.813 --> 14:59.647
and I show you my tattoos?

15:06.530 --> 15:08.615
But before I take my shirt off,
I just need, like,

15:08.657 --> 15:10.408
ten minutes to do some crunches.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.208
Oh, my God.

15:19.376 --> 15:21.544
What a day.

15:21.712 --> 15:23.504
Can I get you anything?

15:23.672 --> 15:24.881
No.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.426
I need to start
making some smart decisions.

15:28.594 --> 15:29.844
With your career?

15:30.012 --> 15:31.387
With my life.

15:32.348 --> 15:33.431
Like what?

15:34.350 --> 15:35.683
I don't know.

15:37.102 --> 15:38.436
We could get married.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.356
- Come on, be serious.
- I am.

15:42.441 --> 15:45.818
Why?
Because I'm a "smart decision"?

15:45.986 --> 15:46.986
Well, yeah.

15:48.238 --> 15:50.823
So, I'm like a bran muffin.

15:52.159 --> 15:54.285
What, no, that's not what I'm saying.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.329
No, it's exactly what you're saying.
I'm the boring thing

15:56.497 --> 15:58.498
you're choosing
because I'm good for you.

15:58.666 --> 16:00.875
What does it matter?
The point is, I'm choosing you.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.503
Well, it matters a lot.
I don't want to be a bran muffin.

16:04.421 --> 16:07.465
I want to be a...
Cinnabon, you know?

16:08.634 --> 16:10.843
A strawberry Pop-Tart.

16:12.096 --> 16:15.556
Something you're excited about even
though it could give you diabetes.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.143
Sweetie, you can be
any pastry you want.

16:19.311 --> 16:22.230
No, no. No, it's too late.
I'm your bran muffin.

16:22.398 --> 16:25.191
Probably fat-free
and good for your colon.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.891
You know what? Forget it.
I never should've brought it up.

16:29.571 --> 16:32.532
You know I want to marry you,
but you're only doing this

16:32.700 --> 16:34.826
because you got fired
and you're feeling sorry for yourself.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.869
Okay, it may look that way,
but getting fired

16:37.037 --> 16:39.247
from that movie was the best thing
that could have happened to me, okay.

16:39.415 --> 16:41.290
I finally realize
I don't need to be famous

16:41.458 --> 16:43.209
or have some big career to be happy.

16:43.377 --> 16:47.005
- Then what do you need?
- You, you stupid Pop-Tart!

16:52.636 --> 16:53.636
Oh.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.932
Then I guess I'm in.

16:59.268 --> 17:01.060
Really?
You guess you're in?

17:02.771 --> 17:06.691
Not like, "I guess I'm in."
Like "I guess I'm in!"

17:08.444 --> 17:10.361
Okay. Cool.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.410
So is that it?
Are we engaged?

17:17.578 --> 17:20.079
Yeah, I think so.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.083
All right.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.295
What's wrong?

17:28.422 --> 17:32.425
I'm not sure.
Just... feels a little anticlimactic.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.970
Yeah, it kind of does, huh?

17:37.556 --> 17:39.474
Oh, I know.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.685
This might help.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.400
Where did you get a ring?

17:49.568 --> 17:53.112
I've... had it for a couple years,
not important.

17:58.952 --> 18:01.537
Penny... will you marry me?

18:03.290 --> 18:04.916
Oh, my God, yes.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.797
This would have been
so much more romantic

18:10.964 --> 18:12.840
if you didn't have
monkey hair on your finger.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.352
How you feeling?

18:24.520 --> 18:28.356
Last night was a little rough,
but I think we're gonna get through this.

18:28.524 --> 18:29.690
I'm proud of us.

18:29.858 --> 18:31.609
Me, too.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.778
Where's mypancakes?

18:33.946 --> 18:36.656
Coming, Mrs. Wolowitz!

18:42.538 --> 18:44.914
- You were right.
- Welcome to Team Putz.
