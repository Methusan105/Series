WEBVTT

00:10.802 --> 00:13.095
- So what did you think?
- It was good.

00:13.805 --> 00:16.140
That's it? "Good"?

00:16.307 --> 00:17.933
I enjoyed it.

00:18.101 --> 00:20.342
When you told me I was going to be
"losing my virginity,"

00:20.437 --> 00:22.563
I didn't think you meant showing me
Raiders of the Lost Ark

00:22.731 --> 00:23.772
for the first time.

00:24.774 --> 00:27.693
My apologies.
I chose my words poorly.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.111
I should have said

00:29.279 --> 00:31.655
you were about to have
your world rocked on my couch.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.368
Anyway, thank you for watching it.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.287
It's one of my all-time favorites.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.497
It was very entertaining,

00:40.665 --> 00:42.958
despite the glaring story problem.

00:44.169 --> 00:46.003
Story problem?

00:46.087 --> 00:47.087
Oh.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.297
Amy...

00:50.425 --> 00:53.218
What a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are.

00:53.386 --> 00:56.013
Raiders of the Lost Ark is
the love child

00:56.181 --> 00:58.140
of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas,

00:58.308 --> 01:00.768
two of the most gifted filmmakers
of our generation.

01:00.935 --> 01:03.437
I've watched it 36 times,

01:03.605 --> 01:06.440
except for the snake scene
and the face-melting scene,

01:06.608 --> 01:09.985
which I can only watch
when it's still light out, but...

01:10.153 --> 01:13.322
I defy you to find a story problem.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.866
Here's my jaw... drop it.

01:17.702 --> 01:18.702
All right.

01:18.828 --> 01:22.206
Indiana Jones plays no role
in the outcome of the story.

01:22.373 --> 01:26.502
If he weren't in the film,
it would turn out exactly the same.

01:26.669 --> 01:30.130
Oh, I see your confusion.
You don't understand.

01:30.298 --> 01:33.967
Indiana Jones was the one in the hat
with the whip.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.971
No, I do,
and if he weren't in the movie,

01:38.139 --> 01:40.015
the Nazis would have still found
the ark,

01:40.183 --> 01:43.060
taken it to the island,
opened it up and all died,

01:43.228 --> 01:45.354
just like they did.

01:50.485 --> 01:51.944
Let me close that for you.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.182
- Hey!
- Hi!

02:22.350 --> 02:24.351
I thought you went to the comic book
store on Wednesdays.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.728
Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy
were having date night

02:26.896 --> 02:29.773
and they don't need me there
to make it awkward.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.235
They have each other for that.

02:34.404 --> 02:35.529
So, how was school?

02:35.697 --> 02:37.072
Oh, good. Check it out.

02:37.240 --> 02:41.076
The Disappointing Child
by Beverly Hofstadter. Oh!

02:49.711 --> 02:52.421
- You bought my mom's book?
- Yeah!

02:53.047 --> 02:55.799
It's on the recommended reading list
for my psychology class.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.801
Oh!

02:59.387 --> 03:01.930
Come on. Not that book.

03:02.056 --> 03:05.934
It's got, like, every horrible story
from my childhood in it.

03:07.729 --> 03:10.522
Oh, cool. Are there pictures?

03:10.690 --> 03:13.275
Seriously, please find another book.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.819
Oh, come on. Why?
How bad could it be?

03:15.987 --> 03:18.113
There's chapters
about potty training,

03:18.281 --> 03:20.991
and bed-wetting and...

03:21.159 --> 03:22.910
masturbation.

03:25.121 --> 03:27.873
Basically, if something came
out of me, she wrote about it!

03:29.626 --> 03:31.668
You know what?
Do whatever you want,

03:31.794 --> 03:33.212
just don't talk to me about it.

03:33.379 --> 03:36.381
Not even the chapter
on the breast-feeding crisis?

03:41.804 --> 03:44.306
It was not a crisis.

03:44.891 --> 03:48.644
Apparently, I favored the left one.
She got a little lopsided.

03:50.438 --> 03:53.065
Oh, my God, you still go left!

03:58.071 --> 04:00.530
Which celebrity would you say
I look like the most?

04:00.698 --> 04:02.407
Halle Berry.

04:04.452 --> 04:05.535
Why?

04:05.870 --> 04:07.955
Stuart and I are putting
dating profiles online,

04:08.081 --> 04:09.539
and it's one of the questions.

04:09.999 --> 04:12.626
And thank you. I'd kill
for that woman's bone structure.

04:15.046 --> 04:16.922
Why are you reading
Pride and Prejudice?

04:17.090 --> 04:18.173
I'll tell you why.

04:18.716 --> 04:21.426
Amy ruined
Raiders of the Lost Ark for me,

04:21.678 --> 04:25.472
so now I'm trying to find something
beloved to her and ruin that.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.768
Because her life wasn't enough?

04:32.021 --> 04:36.233
Wait. How can anyone ruin
Raiders? It's perfect.

04:36.359 --> 04:37.651
Yeah, except for the fact

04:37.819 --> 04:40.362
that Indiana Jones is completely
irrelevant to the story.

04:40.488 --> 04:44.283
With or without him, the Nazis find
the ark, open it, and die.

04:52.875 --> 04:56.586
Hey, wait a minute. No, the Nazis
were digging in the wrong place.

04:56.754 --> 04:59.314
The only reason they got the ark
was because Indy found it first.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.966
Actually, they were only digging
in the wrong place

05:01.134 --> 05:02.374
because Indy had the medallion.

05:02.468 --> 05:06.013
Without him, they would have had
the medallion and dug in the right place.

05:15.231 --> 05:16.523
Okay, I know you don't
want to talk about it,

05:16.691 --> 05:19.568
but can I just ask you one question
about your mom's book?

05:19.777 --> 05:21.903
- No.
- I just want to know

05:22.071 --> 05:24.239
why a five-year-old boy puts
on his mom's makeup

05:24.407 --> 05:26.366
and wears balloon boobies.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.663
They weren't boobies.
They were muscles.

05:32.540 --> 05:35.751
And the makeup was green.
I was pretending to be the Hulk.

05:36.544 --> 05:37.961
You were wearing her bra.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.212
That was to keep my muscles
from sagging!

05:39.505 --> 05:41.631
Can we please stop talking
about this?!

05:42.633 --> 05:45.427
Okay, okay. But you know,
as a student of psychology

05:45.636 --> 05:48.638
who got a check-plus on her
first homework assignment...

05:49.724 --> 05:52.768
I think, sometimes, it's good
to open up about these things.

05:52.935 --> 05:56.104
Okay, fine. Do you want to know
why I dressed like the Hulk?

05:56.230 --> 05:57.898
Because I was always mad at my mom

05:58.024 --> 05:59.941
and I wanted to smash
my way out of that house.

06:00.401 --> 06:03.278
- Well, why were you so angry?
- Gee, I don't know.

06:03.613 --> 06:06.615
Maybe it's because I was always
the subject of her little experiments.

06:06.991 --> 06:09.618
Did you get to the chapter
where she staged the Easter egg hunt

06:09.827 --> 06:12.621
with no eggs to see how long
I'd keep looking?

06:13.956 --> 06:16.958
June.

06:18.461 --> 06:19.878
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.671
I wish there was something I could do
to make you feel better.

06:21.881 --> 06:26.051
- I do, too, but there's not.
- Really? Are you sure about that?

06:29.597 --> 06:32.099
Of course, who am I to argue
with a check-plus student?

06:34.143 --> 06:35.602
Just warning you,
I'm gonna go right.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.521
Don't make a big deal out of it.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.156
Is makeup really necessary?

06:48.950 --> 06:51.159
Well, when someone looks
at your dating profile,

06:51.285 --> 06:52.886
the first thing they see is
your picture.

06:53.204 --> 06:55.455
I just want to make sure
you look fun and full of life

06:55.623 --> 06:58.500
and not like a body
they just pulled out of the river.

06:59.710 --> 07:04.089
All right, here we go,
and... smile.

07:09.470 --> 07:11.805
Okay. That one's in the bank.

07:12.807 --> 07:16.226
How about this? Turn away,
and then turn back into it.

07:16.352 --> 07:20.605
But when you do, imagine the camera
is the girl you want to meet.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.441
You got it.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.119
Okay... let's try it again.

07:35.371 --> 07:37.539
But this time, pretend the girl
you want to meet

07:37.790 --> 07:39.833
doesn't want to hurt you.

07:41.085 --> 07:43.128
I don't think I can give you that.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.172
Come on. One more time.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.767
Yeah, it's...
it's a little blurry,

07:57.894 --> 07:59.728
but I think that works in your favor.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.814
- Do you want a beer?
- Sure.

08:02.940 --> 08:05.484
Hey, have you finished writing
your profile yet?

08:05.568 --> 08:06.568
Almost.

08:06.652 --> 08:09.654
Oh, what did you put as the one-word
description of yourself?

08:09.822 --> 08:12.240
I put "unobjectionable."

08:13.409 --> 08:17.370
But now that I hear it out loud,
it just seems like I'm being cocky.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.206
What did you put
for your best feature?

08:19.332 --> 08:21.416
My parents' money.

08:23.461 --> 08:25.378
What did you put
for your best feature?

08:25.630 --> 08:27.506
I put "not applicable."

08:27.965 --> 08:30.675
Come on, dude,
you're being too hard on yourself.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.321
You've got a lot of good stuff
going on.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.678
Really? Like what?

08:33.721 --> 08:38.141
Well, okay, you're a talented artist.
You own your own business.

08:38.226 --> 08:41.186
Neither of those things have
ever helped me meet a woman.

08:42.021 --> 08:46.441
Okay, well, can we imply
that you're well-endowed?

08:47.985 --> 08:51.404
I do have one oddly long testicle.

08:53.574 --> 08:56.576
Okay, now you're talking like
a winner!

09:00.456 --> 09:01.748
What you doing?

09:01.791 --> 09:04.668
Oh, it turns out Amy's beloved
Pride and Prejudice

09:04.794 --> 09:06.878
is a flawless masterpiece.

09:08.005 --> 09:09.464
He's got too much pride,

09:09.549 --> 09:12.384
she's got too much prejudice...
it just works.

09:12.510 --> 09:15.595
So you're looking to ruin something
for her in the funny pages?

09:15.680 --> 09:19.724
Amy has a fondness
for the comic strip Marmaduke.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.853
- And...?
- And I think I've got it.

09:23.980 --> 09:27.732
A family possesses a dog
that is so large

09:27.858 --> 09:31.486
and poorly disciplined,
he causes nothing but problems.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.988
Why do they keep him?!

09:35.449 --> 09:37.242
Maybe they fell in love with him
as a puppy

09:37.326 --> 09:38.994
and didn't know how big
he was gonna be.

09:39.829 --> 09:40.996
Of course.

09:41.914 --> 09:44.916
You know, why couldn't
she just like Ziggy? Yeah?

09:45.042 --> 09:47.419
That thing's riddled with plot holes.

09:48.796 --> 09:50.547
Sorry, buddy.

09:50.673 --> 09:53.091
I think she's a fan of Garfield
as well.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.845
Oh, darn it, now so am I.

09:57.638 --> 10:00.724
I'll see you later. I got to go watch
a stupid football game with Penny.

10:00.808 --> 10:04.019
Wait, hang on.
You've spent time with Amy.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.605
Can you think of anything
she's fond of

10:06.689 --> 10:09.482
that has a bunch of flaws
she hasn't noticed?

10:14.530 --> 10:16.281
I got to go.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.164
- You ready to go?
- Yep. Hey, and maybe this time,

10:24.290 --> 10:27.125
you don't try and talk sports
with the guys.

10:27.251 --> 10:29.085
Some sports bar.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.004
It's like they never
even heard of Quidditch.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.298
Do we really have to go?

10:33.424 --> 10:35.383
Oh, come on. Every time we're
about to hang out with my friends,

10:35.509 --> 10:36.593
you don't want to.

10:36.677 --> 10:39.137
It's like, "It's too loud,"
or "The bathroom's too dirty,"

10:39.263 --> 10:41.931
or "They put a chicken wing
in my ear." I mean...

10:43.142 --> 10:44.809
Well, you're right.
Let's just go.

10:44.894 --> 10:47.395
- Hey, what's going on with you?
- Nothing, I'm fine.

10:48.105 --> 10:50.774
All right, hang on.
Is this still about your mom's book?

10:50.858 --> 10:53.276
No. Not everything is about my mom.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.612
'Cause if you're still upset
about that, we don't have to go.

10:55.696 --> 10:57.822
Except this is totally about my mom.

10:59.700 --> 11:02.160
I'm so sorry.
I never should have read that book.

11:02.244 --> 11:04.885
You know what? You want to just get
dinner and watch the game here?

11:05.206 --> 11:07.123
- That sounds nice.
- Okay.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.417
Or, you know, we could get take-out

11:09.543 --> 11:10.919
and watch the Blu-ray
extended version

11:11.003 --> 11:13.254
of The Hobbit movie
with commentary track.

11:16.300 --> 11:19.302
On account of how sad I am
about my mom.

11:25.476 --> 11:26.685
Leonard, you ready for lunch?

11:26.769 --> 11:27.894
One sec!

11:30.272 --> 11:31.314
Hey. Sorry.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.236
- Hi, Penny.
- Hi.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.530
All right, sweetie.
You hang in there today.

11:38.614 --> 11:40.573
I'll try, but I might be sad
again tonight.

11:40.658 --> 11:41.658
Okay.

11:45.079 --> 11:47.789
Wow! Sex at work?!

11:47.873 --> 11:49.916
Leave it alone.
That's my girlfriend.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.460
- Sorry.
- Who just had sex with me at work!

11:54.171 --> 11:55.964
Damn.
How'd you swing that?

11:56.090 --> 11:58.383
Whenever I talk about
how awful my mom was,

11:58.426 --> 12:00.385
Penny will do anything
to make me feel better.

12:00.511 --> 12:01.761
- Seriously?
- Look, I mean...

12:01.846 --> 12:04.931
I'm not proud of it,
but it does work.

12:05.057 --> 12:09.185
I got her to watch a six-part
documentary on Monty Python.

12:09.270 --> 12:13.356
Even I was bored, I just wanted
to see if she'd make it to the end.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.650
You sound kind of proud of it.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.986
- I am. I'm really proud.
- Yeah.

12:20.114 --> 12:22.031
Hello, Sheldon.
Is everything okay?

12:22.074 --> 12:24.075
Yes. Why?

12:24.201 --> 12:26.661
Well, the last time you made
an unscheduled video chat,

12:26.746 --> 12:28.747
there was a curly fry
in your regular fries

12:28.831 --> 12:31.416
and you thought someone might be
trying to slip you a mickey.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.628
April 13...

12:35.713 --> 12:37.547
a dark night, indeed.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.175
So what can I do for you?

12:40.259 --> 12:42.469
I'm calling to invite you

12:42.553 --> 12:45.013
to a spontaneous date night
tomorrow evening.

12:45.097 --> 12:47.432
- Really?
- Yes.

12:47.516 --> 12:50.477
You were kind enough to watch
Raiders of the Lost Ark with me.

12:50.561 --> 12:54.814
So I'd like to return the favor
by inviting you to watch an episode

12:54.899 --> 12:57.901
of your favorite childhood
television series,

12:57.985 --> 13:00.069
Little House on the Prairie.

13:01.697 --> 13:03.656
That sounds lovely.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.075
Why are you rubbing your hands
together?

13:10.581 --> 13:13.124
I'm putting on lotion.
Are you in or not?

13:13.250 --> 13:14.793
Of course I'm in.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.670
Excellent.
Then I shall see you tomorrow.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.214
Good night, Dr. Fowler.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.965
Good night, Dr. Cooper.

13:21.091 --> 13:23.259
Good night, indeed.

13:25.262 --> 13:26.888
What a rube.

13:26.972 --> 13:29.599
Why would I put on lotion
when I have such soft hands?

13:31.811 --> 13:34.813
You were really quiet during dinner.
Is everything okay?

13:34.897 --> 13:37.482
Yeah. I guess I was just thinking
about my mom,

13:37.525 --> 13:40.443
and how sad my childhood was.

13:42.530 --> 13:43.571
Yeah, I bet it sucked.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.257
I'm gonna take a bath.
You do the dishes.

13:45.324 --> 13:49.744
How about I take a bath with you
and see what happens.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.205
Here's what's gonna happen:

13:52.248 --> 13:54.415
I'm gonna take a bath,
and you're gonna do the dishes.

13:54.458 --> 13:57.460
That's it?
No compassion?

13:57.503 --> 13:59.838
Aw, poor Howie.
We good? I'm gonna take a bath.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.714
Bernie...

14:01.841 --> 14:03.883
God, what is going on with you?

14:04.009 --> 14:06.553
I'm sharing my pain.

14:07.179 --> 14:10.265
And I'm not buying it. Try again.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.686
I'm learning to be a man in a culture

14:14.770 --> 14:17.355
where it's increasingly difficult
to know how.

14:17.439 --> 14:19.065
Strike two.

14:21.254 --> 14:22.254
I'm copying Leonard.

14:22.278 --> 14:25.071
When he does this to Penny,
they have sex and watch Monty Python.

14:25.781 --> 14:27.532
- Howard!
- I know. It was dumb.

14:27.616 --> 14:30.660
I shouldn't have done it.
And it's making me feel sad.

14:31.787 --> 14:33.288
So sad.

14:35.833 --> 14:38.126
You know, why don't you take a bath?
I'll do the dishes.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.757
Three, two, one...

14:45.634 --> 14:46.759
That's it.

14:46.844 --> 14:49.178
Our dating profiles are live
on the Internet.

14:49.263 --> 14:53.975
My business is open for business!

14:55.519 --> 14:57.437
That's right, ladies.

14:57.521 --> 15:01.274
For all you know,
I'm confident and fun to be around.

15:04.778 --> 15:07.906
Oh, cool, it tells you
when someone's reading your profile.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.783
"Jenny309."

15:11.368 --> 15:12.952
I hope that's not her weight.

15:14.788 --> 15:16.623
If it is, I'll... I'll take her.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.254
Ooh! I got one, too.

15:23.339 --> 15:25.506
The ladies are coming to us.

15:26.967 --> 15:29.093
Oh, man,
if I'd started this years ago,

15:29.178 --> 15:31.721
I'd be divorced two or three times
by now.

15:33.474 --> 15:34.933
What...? Another one.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.393
You know, it's weird.

15:37.519 --> 15:40.355
When they're reading your profile,
does it make you feel exposed?

15:40.439 --> 15:42.273
Like they see you naked?

15:43.859 --> 15:46.653
Well, they're not running away
screaming, so, no.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.199
I love Little House.

15:51.241 --> 15:53.201
It made me want to live
on a farm so much

15:53.285 --> 15:54.869
I tried to milk my cat.

15:58.540 --> 16:01.125
That tangy bowl of Cheerios
was not worth the stitches.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.797
Well, you sit back, relax,

16:05.923 --> 16:08.675
and enjoy a beloved
childhood memory.

16:13.138 --> 16:15.390
You see that cabin there?

16:15.474 --> 16:19.018
I read they were illegally squatting
on Indian land.

16:21.021 --> 16:25.316
Personally, I think what we did
to the Native Americans was wrong,

16:25.401 --> 16:27.944
but this is your favorite show,
not mine.

16:28.862 --> 16:33.533
Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls,
eating that peanut butter sandwich.

16:33.659 --> 16:34.993
Peanut butter?

16:35.160 --> 16:36.452
Huh...

16:37.663 --> 16:39.455
That's strange,

16:39.540 --> 16:43.001
since peanut butter wasn't introduced
until the early 1900s.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.755
If I knew this show was
about time travel,

16:47.840 --> 16:49.757
I would have watched it much sooner.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.804
You're trying to get back at me

16:54.847 --> 16:56.556
for what I said
about Raiders of the Lost Ark.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.391
That's silly.

16:58.517 --> 17:01.102
Almost as silly as Dr. Baker
having a telephone,

17:01.186 --> 17:04.272
since telephones only existed
in large cities at that time.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.483
This is more like Little House
on the Preposterous.

17:08.944 --> 17:11.571
Sheldon, we're in a relationship.

17:11.739 --> 17:14.115
When you get angry, just tell me.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.825
You don't need to seek revenge.

17:16.535 --> 17:17.785
Are you sure?

17:19.621 --> 17:21.414
Every time my dad stayed out
all night,

17:21.457 --> 17:24.083
my mom would put hamster poop
in his chewing tobacco.

17:26.587 --> 17:28.227
Well, that's not how
we're going to do it.

17:28.797 --> 17:30.256
Fine.

17:30.340 --> 17:31.841
I'm mad at you.

17:31.925 --> 17:34.302
Not only did you ruin Raiders for me,

17:34.344 --> 17:36.179
you may have ruined
the whole franchise.

17:36.263 --> 17:38.097
Except for the fourth one,

17:38.140 --> 17:40.266
which was bad
before you got your mitts on it.

17:42.144 --> 17:44.395
I shouldn't have said it.
I'm sorry.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.355
Thank you.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.900
- Do you feel better?
- Yes.

17:49.401 --> 17:51.242
But not as good as I'm going
to when I tell you

17:51.320 --> 17:54.197
that your precious Garfield has
no reason to hate Mondays.

17:55.324 --> 17:57.408
He's a cat.
He doesn't have a job.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.541
Hey, I was just...
What is happening?

18:07.419 --> 18:09.087
Oh, just a little treat.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.923
I know you've been feeling really bad
about your mom lately.

18:12.007 --> 18:15.259
Oh, oh, I have. So bad.

18:15.385 --> 18:17.637
And I wanted to make you feel better,

18:17.805 --> 18:20.515
so I planned something
very special for you.

18:20.641 --> 18:23.267
I can already feel it working.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.938
Hello, Leonard.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.150
Mom?!

18:31.443 --> 18:34.445
I understand you have been whining
about my parenting

18:34.530 --> 18:36.989
in order to emotionally manipulate
your girlfriend.

18:37.658 --> 18:38.866
I... uh...

18:38.951 --> 18:40.535
Bernadette told me everything.

18:40.661 --> 18:42.829
Now you don't get the left
or the right.

18:45.541 --> 18:49.585
Let's discuss why you continue
to involve me in your sex life.

18:49.670 --> 18:52.046
Oh, please, Mommy.
No, Mommy.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.632
When you were six years old,

18:54.716 --> 18:57.468
you walked in on me
and your father naked.

18:58.929 --> 19:02.765
I was swatting his bottom with
your brand-new Ping-Pong paddle.

19:06.061 --> 19:08.146
I didn't dream that?

19:09.606 --> 19:12.024
How did that make you feel?

19:13.235 --> 19:15.945
Penny, come back!
I'm sad for real now!

19:17.948 --> 19:22.493
In the last two hours,
162 women have read our profiles.

19:22.578 --> 19:23.953
How many of them
have sent us messages?

19:24.037 --> 19:25.371
- Combined?
- Yes.

19:25.497 --> 19:27.165
Zero.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.419
Dude, this is... this is brutal.

19:31.545 --> 19:34.714
I don't think I've ever felt
so rejected.

19:34.798 --> 19:38.676
And I had a rescue dog
who ran back to the pound.

19:40.929 --> 19:42.513
This is the worst.

19:42.639 --> 19:43.890
If we're gonna get shot down,

19:43.974 --> 19:46.350
we might as well just go to a bar
and do it old-school.

19:46.435 --> 19:49.979
- And make them look us in the eye.
- Yeah, anything is better than this.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.732
- Hello.
- Not interested.

19:55.819 --> 19:57.945
I was wrong. This is worse.

20:07.122 --> 20:09.415
Wait, wait.
If it wasn't for Indiana Jones,

20:09.499 --> 20:11.499
the ark would never have ended up
at the warehouse!

20:11.501 --> 20:13.336
That's true!

20:13.420 --> 20:17.506
He collected and delivered the ark
to the proper authorities for filing.

20:17.549 --> 20:19.258
- Like a hero!
- Yes!

20:22.262 --> 20:24.722
Although, technically,
Indy was supposed to take the ark

20:24.806 --> 20:27.266
to a museum to be studied.
He couldn't even get that done.
