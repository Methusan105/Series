WEBVTT

00:03.670 --> 00:08.382
So... couldn't help
but notice none of you RSVP'd

00:08.550 --> 00:10.759
to my murder mystery dinner party.

00:10.927 --> 00:13.470
Oh, yeah.
We were meaning to do that.

00:13.638 --> 00:16.849
No, you weren't, because it
was a week ago and nobody came!

00:18.226 --> 00:20.706
So if you want to solve the mystery
of who stabbed Koothrappali

00:20.729 --> 00:24.023
in the back with the weapon of
indifference, it was all of you.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.748
I don't think that qualifies
as a mystery.

00:26.901 --> 00:28.444
We all knew what we were doing.

00:30.530 --> 00:33.532
- We're sorry, Rajesh.
- Maybe we can do it next week.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.576
Whoa, we're not that sorry.

00:35.744 --> 00:39.663
Don't worry, I can take a hint.
No more murder mystery parties.

00:39.831 --> 00:41.123
- Thank you.
- Hallelujah.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.132
Because I've got something
even better planned!

00:43.209 --> 00:46.045
- Come on!
- Just hear me out.

00:46.212 --> 00:48.589
I'm going to make you guys
a scavenger hunt

00:48.757 --> 00:50.049
like they have at MIT.

00:51.009 --> 00:53.927
Oh, I loved those.
I did them every year there.

00:54.095 --> 00:56.138
- We did them at Princeton, too.
- Oh, that's cute.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.598
Like it's a real college.

00:59.142 --> 01:01.560
That's amusing. I was going
to say that about MIT,

01:01.728 --> 01:03.437
but it works for Princeton, too.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.899
Scavenger hunts at Harvard
were really tough.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.901
I always got stuck
on the first challenge.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.986
Trying to find someone
to be on a team with me.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.824
I guess that story's
more sad than funny.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.683
I love scavenger hunts. My friends
and I had them all the time.

01:20.789 --> 01:21.830
Oh, these are a little different.

01:21.998 --> 01:24.124
There's a tradition
at elite universities.

01:24.292 --> 01:25.667
And Princeton.

01:27.003 --> 01:30.631
A tradition of hunts full of puzzles
that rely on logic,

01:30.799 --> 01:32.508
obscure knowledge, science.

01:32.675 --> 01:35.177
Oh, in ours we would just run
around town looking for a store

01:35.345 --> 01:37.262
that would sell us beer.

01:38.681 --> 01:41.183
- So, who's in?
- I think it sounds fun.

01:41.351 --> 01:42.351
- Yeah, me, too.
- I'm in.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.520
- Let's do it.
- I'm sorry.

01:44.687 --> 01:47.314
Are we really doing this
or are we tricking Koothrappali again

01:47.482 --> 01:49.108
like with the dinner party?

02:16.511 --> 02:17.719
What's all this?

02:17.887 --> 02:22.182
Oh, everything I could possibly need
to win the scavenger hunt.

02:22.350 --> 02:24.511
You really think he's gonna
send us to a bowling alley?

02:25.395 --> 02:28.438
Well, if he does, do you know how
filthy those rental balls are?

02:29.941 --> 02:31.191
They might as well
stand on the corner

02:31.359 --> 02:33.193
and give away free rectal exams.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.197
Ahem.

02:37.323 --> 02:39.283
Okay, everybody.

02:39.450 --> 02:40.951
Who's ready for a...

02:41.471 --> 02:42.471
Oh!

02:42.495 --> 02:46.039
...scavenger hunt?

03:03.057 --> 03:06.101
Somewhere... in the city of Pasadena,

03:06.269 --> 03:10.522
I've hidden a golden coin!

03:12.775 --> 03:16.862
You will be faced with a total
of ten puzzles!

03:20.366 --> 03:21.909
Each...

03:22.535 --> 03:26.496
Each... each puzzle will lead you

03:26.664 --> 03:28.540
to the location of the next,

03:28.708 --> 03:32.794
the last of which
will lead you to the coin.

03:34.797 --> 03:39.343
The first team that finds it... wins!

03:41.262 --> 03:42.888
He is a born showman.

03:45.099 --> 03:47.351
Any questions?

03:48.770 --> 03:52.689
Yes, to be fair, do people who went
to Princeton get a head start?

03:52.857 --> 03:54.233
That's not funny.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.319
Oh, it actually is,
if you get the joke.

03:57.487 --> 04:01.281
It's based on the premise that
Princeton isn't a very good school.

04:01.407 --> 04:02.407
Ha-ha.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.826
Oh, see? Now, he gets it.

04:06.162 --> 04:09.081
Okay, guys, go ahead and divide
yourselves into teams of two.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.959
- Should we just do couples?
- Couples sounds great.

04:12.126 --> 04:16.255
Or we could mix things up.
Maybe pick names out of a hat, whatever.

04:16.422 --> 04:19.508
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.469
Why don't you just admit you don't
want to be on a team with me.

04:22.637 --> 04:24.513
I just said, "Couples sound great."

04:24.681 --> 04:26.522
Mm-hmm, yeah, you don't
think I'm smart enough.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.350
You think I'm gonna be a liability.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.144
Even though I totally just used
the word "liability" correctly

04:31.312 --> 04:32.896
in a sentence.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.275
Yeah.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.735
No, let's do couples. I want to.

04:38.903 --> 04:41.280
No, no, no. Let's mix things up.

04:41.447 --> 04:43.365
I choose Sheldon,
and we're gonna kick your ass!

04:43.533 --> 04:45.742
Yeah... really?

04:45.910 --> 04:47.536
The only time I'm ever
picked first for a team

04:47.704 --> 04:49.746
and I'm stuck with the liability?

04:51.582 --> 04:53.583
Stop that.
Penny is not a liability.

04:53.751 --> 04:55.502
Thank you.
Do you want to be on my team?

04:55.670 --> 04:57.796
Maybe we pick names out of a hat.

05:00.883 --> 05:02.843
Hurry up and close the door
so they can't hear us.

05:07.932 --> 05:11.935
Would you stop pouting?
So, you picked my name. Get over it.

05:12.103 --> 05:16.315
Yes, and do you know what
the odds are I'd pick your name?

05:16.482 --> 05:19.568
- No.
One in five.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.528
Now you know why I'm pouting.

05:23.489 --> 05:26.742
All right, teams.
Get ready to open your first puzzle.

05:26.909 --> 05:28.410
Go!

05:30.955 --> 05:34.583
Do you see what I did?
The first puzzle is a puzzle!

05:34.751 --> 05:38.337
Oh, my God, how adorable is that?

05:38.504 --> 05:40.756
I wish I had a friend like me.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.509
What are you doing?
You have to start with the edges.

05:44.719 --> 05:47.440
There's no right way, Sheldon.
I already found a few pieces that fit.

05:47.513 --> 05:50.766
Yeah, well, take them apart
and start with the edges.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.977
And stop wasting time.

05:55.980 --> 05:58.190
Wow, you're really good at puzzles.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.679
I did them all the time as a kid.

05:59.692 --> 06:02.110
As my mom used to say,
"When you're doing a puzzle,

06:02.278 --> 06:04.780
it's like having a thousand friends."

06:07.075 --> 06:09.368
She was full
of fun lies like that.

06:09.535 --> 06:13.330
If it makes you feel any better,
my mom's just full of pound cake.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.154
I'm sorry you got stuck with me.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.770
I bet you wanted
to be with Bernadette.

06:18.836 --> 06:20.253
Have you ever played
a game with Bernadette?

06:20.421 --> 06:21.963
- No.
- Have you ever gone

06:22.131 --> 06:24.591
into a steel cage with a wolverine?

06:25.676 --> 06:28.178
Faster, faster, faster!
Do you not know that word?

06:28.346 --> 06:32.057
- It means "more fast"!
- Stop yelling at me.

06:32.225 --> 06:35.977
Hey! You'll know
when I'm yelling at you.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.814
Oh. Oh, it's the comic book store!
All right, come on.

06:38.981 --> 06:40.273
That's where we have to go.

06:40.441 --> 06:41.858
But we haven't finished the puzzle.

06:42.026 --> 06:45.362
Well, it doesn't matter!
We know the answer!

06:45.530 --> 06:49.241
You think you know the answer.
But it could be a trick.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.201
What if when the puzzle's complete,

06:51.369 --> 06:53.120
there's a sign
in the window that says,

06:53.287 --> 06:54.788
"Go to the train store"?

06:54.956 --> 06:56.790
Okay, it's not gonna say that.

06:56.958 --> 07:01.086
Well, I hope you're wrong.
I really want to go to the train store.

07:02.839 --> 07:05.465
It's the comic book store. Let's go!

07:05.633 --> 07:08.718
Come on, numb nuts,
it's the comic book store!

07:14.976 --> 07:17.056
It's the comic book store,
it's the comic book store,

07:17.186 --> 07:18.687
it's the comic book store!

07:29.323 --> 07:31.158
- It's the comic book store.
- Oh!

07:37.498 --> 07:40.179
- Do you think Penny's mad at me?
- Because you're in the right lane

07:40.209 --> 07:44.296
behind a bus and won't go around it?
I'm sure she finds it charming.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.215
No, because I didn't
want her on my team.

07:47.383 --> 07:49.676
I'm starting to think
she dodged a bullet.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.803
The slowest bullet in the world.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.849
I never realized
you were so competitive.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.059
Yeah, I know.

07:58.227 --> 08:00.937
It's probably because I grew up
with five brothers and sisters

08:01.105 --> 08:02.265
so I had to fight for every...

08:02.273 --> 08:04.649
Oh, my God, you did not
just slow down for a bird!

08:04.817 --> 08:06.610
You know they fly, right?!

08:12.408 --> 08:13.617
I think this is
the first time we've ever

08:13.784 --> 08:15.494
actually been alone together.

08:15.661 --> 08:19.289
Huh, I guess you're right.
Wonder why that is.

08:19.457 --> 08:22.292
Well, off the top of my head,
I'd say we don't have a lot

08:22.460 --> 08:24.920
in common except for the people
we're involved with.

08:25.087 --> 08:27.088
Plus, when we first met,
Penny warned me never

08:27.256 --> 08:29.591
to get into a car alone with you.

08:30.968 --> 08:32.552
Yeah.

08:34.180 --> 08:37.766
You know, I bet you and I have
more in common than we think.

08:37.934 --> 08:40.602
- Such as?
- I don't know.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.730
- Tell me some things you like.
- Uh, let's see.

08:43.898 --> 08:47.067
I like harps,
Little House on the Prairie,

08:47.235 --> 08:49.236
medieval poetry,
medieval literature...

08:49.403 --> 08:51.196
Hey, how about some music?

08:52.657 --> 08:55.408
Great. Sheldon never lets me
listen to music in the car.

08:55.576 --> 08:58.078
He doesn't want to be mistaken
for a gang member.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.956
Find something you like.

09:01.123 --> 09:03.458
Beatles, boring.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.919
Eminem, scary.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.463
Weird Al? How old are you?

09:09.674 --> 09:13.843
- Neil Diamond?
- Yeah, I love Neil Diamond.

09:14.011 --> 09:15.637
I love Neil Diamond.

09:35.324 --> 09:37.534
Oh, hey, thanks for letting me
use the comic book store

09:37.702 --> 09:39.702
- as part of the scavenger hunt.
- Oh, my pleasure.

09:39.787 --> 09:41.580
Always happy to help out
with fun things

09:41.747 --> 09:44.165
that I wasn't invited
to be a part of.

09:44.333 --> 09:48.211
Oh, congratulations.
You're the first team to arrive.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.922
Yes! It's not a ruse
to make fun of me!

09:51.090 --> 09:53.675
It's a real game and I'm winning it!

09:55.344 --> 09:58.555
Your next puzzle is a riddle.

09:58.723 --> 10:02.684
And who better to give it to you
than The Riddler?

10:04.103 --> 10:08.064
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

10:08.232 --> 10:09.858
How am I faster than you?

10:10.026 --> 10:13.111
I'm in heels and I stopped
to take a phone call.

10:13.279 --> 10:17.574
I have asthma. Back off!

10:17.742 --> 10:21.995
"Riddle me this.
Arrah, Arrah, and gather round,

10:22.163 --> 10:24.873
the work of this hero
is legion-bound.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.542
He multiplies N
by the number of He,

10:27.710 --> 10:31.046
and in this room
the thing you'll see."

10:31.213 --> 10:32.464
- Good riddle, huh?
- Yeah.

10:32.632 --> 10:36.384
So when you guys plan fun activities,
does my name even...

10:36.552 --> 10:38.178
come up, or...?

10:39.722 --> 10:41.640
I invited you to my
murder mystery party.

10:41.807 --> 10:47.270
- No, you didn't.
- Oh.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.815
We're the last ones here,
hurry up!

10:50.983 --> 10:54.194
- It is a marathon, not a sprint.
- People run in a marathon!

10:54.362 --> 10:56.196
Not with a bowling ball
on their back.

10:56.364 --> 10:58.698
Hey, Penny, I just
wanted to say good luck,

10:58.866 --> 11:00.306
and I hope there's no hard feelings.

11:00.409 --> 11:03.828
Hey, Romeo! Repair your relationship
on your own time!

11:05.414 --> 11:08.500
Relax, it's a hard puzzle.
It's gonna take a while to solve.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.251
- "Riddle me this..."
- Got it.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.171
Hey, Princeton, look at that,

11:13.339 --> 11:15.423
Team Community College Night School
is in the lead.

11:17.385 --> 11:20.011
I thought we were
the Lightning Sharks!

11:21.555 --> 11:23.598
Hey, you know what this could mean...

11:25.059 --> 11:28.103
Oh, oh, that's good.
Then this would be...

11:28.270 --> 11:30.647
- That's it.
- To the Neil Mobile!

11:32.566 --> 11:34.484
I knew it, we're gonna lose!

11:34.652 --> 11:36.152
Wait, I got it. I got it!

11:36.320 --> 11:38.863
Congratulations, you got it last.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.455
You're really mean, you know that?

11:54.755 --> 11:56.840
So no one's gonna buy anything.

11:59.802 --> 12:02.721
A-ha! Okay...

12:02.888 --> 12:04.347
Let's see.

12:04.515 --> 12:08.059
"To continue on your quest,
leave no stone unturned."

12:08.227 --> 12:10.520
The next clue must be hidden
under one of these rocks.

12:10.688 --> 12:12.605
Okay.

12:12.773 --> 12:13.982
Sheldon, I've got to ask.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.651
How did you figure out
that it was the geology lab?

12:16.819 --> 12:17.610
Oh, simple.

12:17.778 --> 12:20.697
The Arrah Arrah in the riddle
meant Jan Arrah,

12:20.865 --> 12:23.450
a member of the Legion of
Superheroes known as Element Lad.

12:23.617 --> 12:26.786
And then the word "He,"
it wasn't the masculine pronoun,

12:26.954 --> 12:29.622
but rather, "H-E,"
the abbreviation for helium.

12:29.665 --> 12:31.583
See where I'm going with this?

12:33.669 --> 12:36.504
- Yes.
- Nice try.

12:36.672 --> 12:38.840
Now, Element Lad's ability

12:39.008 --> 12:41.009
is the power to transmute
chemical elements.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.595
Helium has an atomic number of two.

12:43.763 --> 12:47.599
If you multiply that by the
atomic number of "N," nitrogen,

12:47.767 --> 12:52.061
you get 14, which is
the atomic number of...?

12:54.315 --> 12:57.692
I'm just funnin' you, silicon.
And that is the most common element

12:57.860 --> 12:59.944
in the Earth's surface.
So that narrowed it down

13:00.112 --> 13:02.030
to the geology lab
or the chemistry lab.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.407
Wow.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.826
I can drink a beer underwater.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.871
And I'm sure your parents are proud.

13:10.039 --> 13:14.375
Now, finally, the line
"in this room the thing you'll see"

13:14.543 --> 13:17.629
was an obvious reference
to Fantastic Four member The Thing,

13:17.797 --> 13:21.549
- who's made entirely of...
- Shut up. I solved it!

13:25.846 --> 13:28.014
Those are map coordinates.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.225
Got 'em. Let's go.

13:30.392 --> 13:33.269
Wait. Don't you want to know
how I figured it out?

13:33.437 --> 13:35.063
No one likes a know-it-all, Penny.

13:58.629 --> 13:59.963
Um...

14:00.089 --> 14:05.093
I'm okay with you driving my car,
I'm not okay with you flying my car.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.303
Don't sweat it, my dad's a cop.
He can fix things.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.266
Uh-huh. Like death?

14:11.433 --> 14:15.728
Your kid may be an honor student,
but you're a moron!

14:18.190 --> 14:19.816
Penny's not answering my texts.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.693
Who cares?
Focus on the game.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.279
This stupid game is why
she's mad in the first place.

14:24.446 --> 14:26.114
- I'm telling her I'm quitting.
- No!

14:26.282 --> 14:28.700
Quitting would be the worst thing
for your relationship.

14:28.868 --> 14:29.868
Why?

14:30.035 --> 14:33.162
Because it would make you seem like
something she already thinks you are.

14:33.330 --> 14:37.625
- What does she think I am?
- How do I put this?

14:37.793 --> 14:42.922
She's been known to call you a name
that usually applies to a lady part.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.092
Or a cat.

14:48.095 --> 14:50.263
Or a willow.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.602
I can't believe
she would say that about me.

14:55.769 --> 14:59.105
If you're gonna cry about it,
there's tissues in my purse.

14:59.273 --> 15:02.525
Unless you got some in yours.
Big willow.

15:27.509 --> 15:31.012
Okay... another 30 feet.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.014
Okay.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.849
Oh. It's a bowling alley.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.394
Yes. Yes!

15:38.562 --> 15:43.524
My brain is better than everybody's!

15:59.124 --> 16:02.377
Call me a lady part.
We'll see about that.

16:05.714 --> 16:07.924
- Can you reach the clue?
- Almost.

16:08.092 --> 16:11.386
Hurry, Sheldon and Penny were right
behind us in the bowling alley.

16:11.553 --> 16:14.097
- Got it!
- Great, climb back up.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.810
Come on!

16:21.063 --> 16:23.731
Yeah, Penny might be onto something.

16:26.026 --> 16:27.902
- To the planetarium!
- Let's go!

16:28.070 --> 16:30.279
- To the tar pits!
- Let's go!

16:30.447 --> 16:32.198
There's a Neil Diamond
concert next month!

16:32.366 --> 16:34.075
Let's go!

16:36.912 --> 16:39.998
Three bags, no one's opened 'em.
We're the first ones here!

16:40.916 --> 16:43.668
- It's dirty laundry. You're up.
- Why me?

16:43.836 --> 16:46.212
Because you've been training
for this your whole life.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.589
You live in a pile of dirty laundry.

16:51.218 --> 16:52.579
They're here first.
This is because

16:52.720 --> 16:55.054
you made me slow down
for that blind guy.

16:55.222 --> 16:59.267
- Okay, the clue must be in the bag.
- The clue must be in the bag.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.755
- It's just a bunch of pants.
- It's just a bunch of pants.

17:02.896 --> 17:04.564
You know, I'm surprised
you want to copy my answers

17:04.732 --> 17:06.399
since I'm not even smart
enough to be on your team.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.943
Well, why would you want
to be on someone's team

17:09.111 --> 17:12.405
who you like to call a... I can't
even say it in front of Sheldon.

17:13.449 --> 17:14.657
What are you talking about?

17:14.825 --> 17:16.576
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

17:16.744 --> 17:19.078
No, she doesn't.
I just made that up.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.372
Why would you do that?

17:21.540 --> 17:24.301
Because you were about to quit like
a big... Sheldon, cover your ears.

17:25.794 --> 17:29.255
I'm not a child.
I know the word "ninny."

17:29.882 --> 17:32.216
Yeah, well, you should have quit
'cause I'm still gonna beat your ass.

17:32.384 --> 17:35.136
Wish I had a man
like her on my team.

17:35.304 --> 17:38.473
Hey, I am every bit
as much of a man as Penny.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.683
Now, let's do this!

17:40.851 --> 17:43.603
Wait, it's not all pants,
there's one shirt.

17:43.771 --> 17:46.355
- Oh.
- Hey, that's my shirt.

17:46.523 --> 17:48.566
- This one is, too.
- No, no, that's not mine.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.110
- That has a big spot on it.
- Wait. So does this one.

17:51.278 --> 17:53.029
Maybe the spot's the clue.

17:58.410 --> 18:01.079
"Sheldon's spot."
The coin is in your spot!

18:02.581 --> 18:04.957
- Oh, that's clever.
- Hurry!

18:05.125 --> 18:07.919
Be there in a minute.
I just have to pre-soak these!

18:14.426 --> 18:17.637
Stop her, Leonard! Stop her!

18:24.394 --> 18:27.688
- Where the hell's the coin?
- Wasn't the answer Sheldon's spot?

18:27.856 --> 18:32.026
Oh, yes, Leonard. Yes, it was.

18:33.028 --> 18:36.197
- Then where's the coin?
- Yes, exactly.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.740
Where is the coin?

18:39.159 --> 18:41.452
Why don't you look in your pockets?

18:45.415 --> 18:48.042
I slipped them in there
earlier today.

18:50.087 --> 18:53.339
- I don't get it.
- Don't you see?

18:53.507 --> 18:57.593
When we're all having fun together,
we're already winners.

18:57.761 --> 18:59.554
Oh, look. See?

18:59.721 --> 19:01.848
Even I'm a winner.

19:04.059 --> 19:05.309
Are you kidding me?

19:06.728 --> 19:09.313
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

19:10.524 --> 19:14.402
You suck so hard.

19:15.696 --> 19:18.573
Well, I thought...
Come on, I didn't want anyone

19:18.740 --> 19:20.533
to feel bad at the end of the game.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.827
And some of those puzzles
were really hard

19:22.995 --> 19:24.635
and I didn't know
who was gonna get Penny.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.587
Run.

19:32.754 --> 19:36.007
Okay, okay, that came out wrong,
but you have to admit,

19:36.175 --> 19:38.259
you all had a wonderful time.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.762
Run to India.

19:42.639 --> 19:46.017
I just wanted to do
something beautiful!

19:49.897 --> 19:52.732
Hey, look. I won.
