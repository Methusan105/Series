WEBVTT

00:03.336 --> 00:05.216
So, we're about to shoot
this scene in the movie

00:05.338 --> 00:08.340
where the killer ape DNA
is slowly taking over my body.

00:08.508 --> 00:09.591
Okay.

00:09.759 --> 00:13.387
But I realize they're gluing fur
everywhere except my cleavage.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.764
So, I asked the director why
and he says,

00:15.932 --> 00:17.572
"It's important
to the story that my boobs

00:17.642 --> 00:19.977
be the last things to turn ape."

00:22.814 --> 00:25.691
It's sweet that he thinks
there's a story.

00:27.068 --> 00:28.402
Oh, and there's not
even a bathroom on set.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.779
I had to go to the gas station
across the street.

00:30.947 --> 00:32.614
I mean, I was dressed
like half an ape

00:32.782 --> 00:35.659
and still not even close to the
most disgusting person in there.

00:36.619 --> 00:38.579
Leonard, I could use
your assistance.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.289
- Sure. What's up?
- Well, now that I've given up

00:40.457 --> 00:43.917
string theory, I'm struggling
to find my next area of focus.

00:44.085 --> 00:45.753
In your professional opinion,

00:45.920 --> 00:48.547
which of these areas do you think
is the most promising?

00:48.715 --> 00:51.925
Well, I think there's some
really innovative stuff

00:52.093 --> 00:54.344
- going on in dark matter.
- That's helpful.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.851
- Okay, of these four areas...
- Sheldon!

01:01.019 --> 01:03.312
What did we say about
being a nicer friend?

01:03.480 --> 01:05.147
- Thank you.
- Leonard, what did we say

01:05.315 --> 01:07.066
about being a gullible weenie?

01:08.526 --> 01:10.986
- It is just so frustrating.
- 'Cause you're trying too hard.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.905
You need to do something else.
Get your mind off it.

01:13.073 --> 01:16.408
Hey, how about we bring back
Anything Can Happen Thursdays?

01:16.576 --> 01:18.327
Hey, that's good.
Why'd you guys stop doing that?

01:18.495 --> 01:20.287
You made fun of us.
Said it was stupid.

01:21.539 --> 01:22.831
Yeah. Sounds like me.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.321
Come on, Sheldon.
What do you say?

01:25.335 --> 01:29.546
All right. I officially reinstate
Anything Can Happen Thursday.

01:29.714 --> 01:31.423
Great!
What do you want to do?

01:32.592 --> 01:37.304
I don't know.
What do you want to do?

01:38.807 --> 01:41.647
I'm starting to remember the problem
with Anything Can Happen Thursdays.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.169
Hmm.

02:09.212 --> 02:11.588
What could we do that's fun?

02:11.756 --> 02:13.423
What could we do that's different?

02:13.591 --> 02:16.343
What could we do that's free?

02:18.555 --> 02:21.348
Got it! We order a pizza.

02:21.516 --> 02:24.184
Are you kidding? That's what you
always do. Think harder.

02:24.352 --> 02:27.396
You're right. You're right.
Got it!

02:27.564 --> 02:31.984
We order calzones, cut them open,
eat them like pizza.

02:33.361 --> 02:35.801
All right! All right!
I'll shake the brain bush one more time,

02:35.947 --> 02:37.948
see what falls out.

02:38.116 --> 02:41.160
Got it! There's a live-action
role-playing group

02:41.327 --> 02:43.287
that meets every Thursday night
in Griffith Park

02:43.454 --> 02:46.165
and reenacts battles
from Lord of the Rings.

02:46.332 --> 02:49.751
Okay, tell me more
about this calzone idea.

02:51.129 --> 02:53.422
You know what?
Why don't we just ease into this.

02:53.590 --> 02:57.176
Let's go for a walk
and see if we find a new restaurant.

02:57.343 --> 03:01.054
Any chance that restaurant
is near Griffith Park?

03:04.058 --> 03:06.310
- No.
- All right.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.438
Raj and Howard
are at Howard's moms,

03:09.606 --> 03:11.190
but should we call the girls
and see if they want to come?

03:11.357 --> 03:13.650
- No. Bernadette's working late.
- Amy's sick.

03:13.818 --> 03:16.278
- What's wrong with her?
- Well, she talks a lot.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.155
She always wants to hold hands.

03:18.323 --> 03:19.990
That's not what I meant.

03:20.158 --> 03:21.838
Well, if you were
referring to her illness,

03:21.951 --> 03:23.831
your question should have been,
"What ails her?"

03:25.580 --> 03:27.247
- What ails her?
- Oh. Who knows?

03:30.251 --> 03:33.754
Come on, anything can happen.
We can push him down the stairs!

03:35.965 --> 03:38.133
Hey. Thanks for coming to hang out.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.843
No problem. How's your mom feeling?

03:40.011 --> 03:43.305
Okay, but she'd feel better
if she took her medicine.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.353
You know, when Cinnamon
won't take her medicine,

03:45.516 --> 03:47.100
I hide it in a piece of cheese.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.228
Good idea.
We can wrap the pill in cheese,

03:49.395 --> 03:51.563
feed it to Cinnamon,
and then my mom can eat Cinnamon.

03:55.151 --> 03:57.903
- What do you feel like doing?
- I was thinking we could watch a DVD.

03:58.071 --> 04:01.657
Well, my mom doesn't have
a lot to choose from.

04:03.201 --> 04:05.994
Unless you want to watch
the video of her colonoscopy.

04:06.996 --> 04:09.748
20 minutes in,
they find a prune pit.

04:11.417 --> 04:15.879
Actually, how do you feel about
watching House of 1000 Corpses?

04:16.047 --> 04:19.258
A straight-up gore-fest?
You hate this stuff.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.426
I do, but for some reason,
Emily loves it

04:21.594 --> 04:22.886
and wants to watch it
with me tomorrow,

04:23.054 --> 04:24.615
so I thought if
I saw it with you first,

04:24.764 --> 04:27.140
then I could act cool
about it with her.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.184
That's actually not a bad plan.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.019
I can sit through
the colonoscopy now,

04:31.187 --> 04:34.273
but that first time I was like,
"Oh, my God, a prune pit!"

04:39.821 --> 04:41.863
- So you'd watch it?
- Sure.

04:42.031 --> 04:43.782
You're a good friend.
I owe you one.

04:43.950 --> 04:47.744
Howard!
Help me get out of the tub!

04:52.250 --> 04:54.042
Not that one.

04:56.754 --> 04:59.047
So we're just randomly
choosing a restaurant

04:59.215 --> 05:01.300
- without researching it online?
- Yep.

05:01.467 --> 05:02.926
Great.

05:03.094 --> 05:04.895
This is how Anything Can
Happen Thursday turns

05:05.054 --> 05:07.014
into It Won't Stop Coming Out Friday.

05:09.517 --> 05:12.477
Hey, how about
that Asian fusion place?

05:12.645 --> 05:14.896
Fusion and Asians?

05:15.064 --> 05:17.899
I'm trying not to
think about science.

05:19.235 --> 05:20.402
What the hell?

05:22.155 --> 05:24.114
What... she's not working late!

05:25.408 --> 05:29.036
- And Amy doesn't look sick.
- Why would they lie to us?

05:29.203 --> 05:30.495
That's a good question.

05:31.247 --> 05:32.456
Amy and Bernadette.

05:32.498 --> 05:36.251
Amy and Bernadette.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.545
Why did you lie to us?

05:42.592 --> 05:43.884
Hey. Listen to this.

05:44.218 --> 05:48.180
"Murder, cannibalism
and satanic rituals

05:48.348 --> 05:52.017
are just a few of the thousand-plus
horrors that await."

05:52.185 --> 05:54.019
I just helped my mom
out of the tub,

05:54.187 --> 05:56.855
so I'm one slippery horror
ahead of you.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.284
You're a good son.
I don't know how you do it.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.653
Beach blankets, my friend.
It's all about beach blankets.

06:03.821 --> 06:06.823
All right,
let's get this over with.

06:06.991 --> 06:09.618
Ew!
It's got someone's hair on it!

06:10.620 --> 06:12.788
Oh, yeah, you're gonna
do great with this movie.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.461
You're not working late.
Why did you lie to me?

06:19.629 --> 06:21.797
And Amy, you told me you were sick,

06:21.964 --> 06:25.008
but you look just as pale
and tired as always.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.136
I'm sorry.
I just needed a break

06:28.304 --> 06:31.223
from hearing you obsess about
what to do after string theory.

06:32.350 --> 06:34.142
And we kind of just wanted one night
where we didn't have to hear

06:34.310 --> 06:36.436
about how miserable you are
making this movie.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.481
But none of that means
we don't love you.

06:39.649 --> 06:42.109
I haven't been complaining
that much about the movie.

06:43.319 --> 06:44.486
Have I?

06:45.696 --> 06:46.905
I also love you.

06:51.035 --> 06:54.413
You know what?
Maybe I need a break from all of you.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.832
- Come on, Sheldon.
- Where are we going?

06:56.999 --> 06:58.583
We're gonna have
Anything Can Happen Thursday.

06:58.709 --> 07:00.669
You're gonna tell me all about your
science stuff and I'm gonna complain

07:00.837 --> 07:02.421
about my movie,
and we're gonna support each other

07:02.588 --> 07:04.714
- because that's what friends do.
- Okay.

07:05.842 --> 07:08.043
If I had to pick now,
I'd probably go with dark matter...

07:08.052 --> 07:09.761
Shut up.

07:23.067 --> 07:26.361
- What's wrong?
- I don't understand my food.

07:28.281 --> 07:31.867
Chinese noodles
with Korean barbecue...

07:32.952 --> 07:35.287
...in a taco.

07:36.497 --> 07:38.290
It's fusion.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.209
Well, my mother would
lock her car doors

07:41.377 --> 07:44.588
if she had to drive through
this hodgepodge of ethnicity.

07:48.092 --> 07:50.172
Think I've been complaining
too much about the movie?

07:50.261 --> 07:53.388
- Not at all.
- Thank you.

07:53.556 --> 07:56.224
But to be fair, when you talk,
most of what you say sounds like,

07:56.392 --> 07:59.728
"Wah, wah, wah, clothes.
Wah, wah, wah."

08:03.274 --> 08:05.150
Hey, I don't understand
why you're not upset with Amy.

08:05.318 --> 08:08.069
I am. So much so that
I'm gonna bring her here

08:08.237 --> 08:09.905
for dinner on our next date night.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.083
Okay.

08:22.251 --> 08:24.920
So, in the last 20 minutes,

08:25.087 --> 08:27.589
we've seen a crazy woman
kissing a fetus in a jar.

08:29.300 --> 08:33.178
We've seen a guy cut in half
and sewn to a fish.

08:34.305 --> 08:38.850
And the brutal dismemberment
of a rotisserie chicken by my mother.

08:41.270 --> 08:44.356
On the bright side,
she didn't even notice the pill.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.402
Why does Emily like this stuff?

08:49.570 --> 08:51.780
Do you think there's something
psychologically wrong with her?

08:51.948 --> 08:54.282
- What difference does it make?
- What do you mean?

08:54.450 --> 08:56.090
Oh, come on, she could
have a freezer full

08:56.118 --> 08:58.662
of ex-boyfriend's body parts
and you'd still go out with her.

09:00.039 --> 09:02.874
I do like that the ex-boyfriend's
out of the picture.

09:07.296 --> 09:09.214
I feel so bad
about lying to Sheldon.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.966
How am I gonna make it up to him?

09:11.133 --> 09:13.051
I'd tell you what I do with Howard,

09:13.219 --> 09:15.420
but I don't think dressing up
like a Catholic schoolgirl

09:15.429 --> 09:17.389
is gonna work with Sheldon.

09:21.310 --> 09:23.395
He'd probably give you homework.

09:27.149 --> 09:30.026
- Did you lie to Howard about tonight?
- Of course.

09:30.194 --> 09:31.653
And you don't feel guilty about it?

09:31.821 --> 09:34.656
Between Penny's gorilla movie
and Howard's gorilla mother,

09:34.824 --> 09:36.408
I had no choice.

09:37.743 --> 09:40.495
Thankfully, Penny and I have
a relationship based on honesty.

09:43.624 --> 09:45.000
What?
I don't lie to her.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.419
Oh, we know you don't lie to her.

09:54.385 --> 09:55.510
Thank you.

09:55.678 --> 09:59.014
Hey, maybe the answer to your
career question is in one of these.

09:59.181 --> 10:02.934
Penny, there's only one cookie
with something in the middle

10:03.102 --> 10:06.229
that solves life's problems,
and that's an Oreo.

10:08.899 --> 10:11.526
Or a Nutter Butter,
if you're in a pinch.

10:11.694 --> 10:14.237
Come on, open it.
I bet it says something great.

10:14.405 --> 10:16.573
This is Asian fusion.

10:16.741 --> 10:20.201
For all you know,
there's a tiny Chihuahua in here.

10:20.369 --> 10:22.579
Fine, I'll go.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.250
"People turn to you
for guidance and wisdom."

10:27.418 --> 10:30.378
- Yeah, that's a good one.
- No, it's not.

10:30.546 --> 10:34.174
- How is that not good?
- "Turn to you for wisdom?"

10:34.342 --> 10:36.718
Clearly, that cookie is mocking you.

10:37.970 --> 10:41.014
You'd never hear that kind of sass
from a Nutter Butter.

10:41.557 --> 10:45.060
Since you're paying for dinner,
I'll let that slide. Open yours.

10:47.396 --> 10:50.398
- Have you ever paid for a meal?
- Not with money. Read.

10:53.569 --> 10:57.572
"Your warm and fun-loving nature
delights those around you."

10:57.740 --> 10:59.491
Oh, try again.

11:11.712 --> 11:12.712
Let me get this straight.

11:12.880 --> 11:17.550
So, he kills this girl's father,
cuts off the guy's face,

11:17.718 --> 11:21.930
and is wearing it as a mask
while he makes out with her.

11:23.599 --> 11:26.643
I'm just gonna say it.
That's not okay.

11:30.189 --> 11:33.983
Why can't I be in a relationship with
a girl who likes The Sound of Music?

11:35.403 --> 11:37.362
Raj, you are the girl
in the relationship

11:37.530 --> 11:39.364
who likes The Sound of Music.

11:44.745 --> 11:46.663
Hey, Penny.
What's up?

11:47.623 --> 11:50.125
No, Bernie's working late.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.378
Really?

11:54.296 --> 11:55.380
Thanks for telling me.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.133
What?

11:58.300 --> 12:01.302
I'm having sex with
a Catholic schoolgirl tonight.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.853
Oh, I think I see our next stop.

12:11.313 --> 12:13.022
You can't be serious.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.817
If I wanted to waste my time
on nonsense,

12:15.985 --> 12:17.986
I'd follow Leonard on Instagram.

12:19.321 --> 12:23.116
No, come on.
Tonight, we are trying new things.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.828
Oh! That's a lot of incense.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.914
Or someone set a hippie on fire.

12:33.085 --> 12:36.129
Yeah, honey,
I'm still stuck at work.

12:36.297 --> 12:39.549
Really?
Penny said that?

12:41.343 --> 12:44.012
Okay, it's true.
I'm sorry.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.972
I'll see you at home.

12:46.140 --> 12:49.017
Yeah, yeah, I'll put it on.

12:50.186 --> 12:53.521
You and I never just
hang out like this. Why is that?

12:53.689 --> 12:56.524
- I know. It's weird, right?
- Yeah. We should do it more often.

12:56.692 --> 12:59.194
Oh, no. I mean,
this is weird right now.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.783
- It's Penny.
- Is she still mad?

13:04.950 --> 13:08.787
Doesn't seem like it. She got Sheldon
to go to a psychic with her.

13:08.954 --> 13:12.582
A psychic? He considers them
not just mumbo jumbo,

13:12.750 --> 13:15.543
but extra-jumbo mumbo jumbo.

13:15.711 --> 13:18.671
Well, Penny can be very persuasive.

13:18.839 --> 13:21.239
She's gotten me to do a lot
of things I wouldn't normally do.

13:21.258 --> 13:24.719
- Because she has sex with you.
- Yeah, she does.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.514
Can I confess something?

13:28.599 --> 13:29.891
Once in a while,
I get a little jealous

13:30.059 --> 13:31.810
of how close Penny
and Sheldon are.

13:31.977 --> 13:34.896
- Really?
- I mean, not in a romantic way.

13:35.064 --> 13:37.816
It's just, she really has some
sort of connection with him.

13:37.983 --> 13:40.735
Well... Well, they've known
each other a long time,

13:40.903 --> 13:43.029
and Penny grew up around horses,

13:43.197 --> 13:46.157
so she knows how to approach him
without making him skittish.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.993
Don't get me wrong.
I'm glad they're friends.

13:49.161 --> 13:52.455
I just wish he'd be that
comfortable around me already.

13:52.623 --> 13:55.792
Well, it took him a long time
to get comfortable around me, too.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.127
Really? What did you do?

13:58.295 --> 14:01.714
Something terrible in a former life?
I don't know.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.677
I gotta go.
Penny ratted me out.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.804
FYI, she's getting you
a watch for your birthday

14:07.972 --> 14:09.492
with money she took
out of your wallet.

14:15.604 --> 14:18.523
I don't mean to be rude
or discourteous,

14:18.691 --> 14:20.900
but before we begin,
I'd just like to say

14:21.068 --> 14:23.653
there is absolutely
no scientific evidence

14:23.821 --> 14:25.780
to support clairvoyance of any kind.

14:25.948 --> 14:30.201
Which means,
and again, no insult intended,

14:30.369 --> 14:31.870
but you're a fraud...

14:33.122 --> 14:34.956
...your profession is a swindle,

14:35.124 --> 14:39.294
and your livelihood is dependent
on the gullibility of stupid people.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.089
Again, no offense.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.646
All right, Sheldon,
just ask your question.

14:48.929 --> 14:51.306
Okay, I just did.
What was it?

14:52.433 --> 14:54.767
Oh, for God's sake. Look, he's a
physicist who's trying to figure out

14:54.935 --> 14:56.227
what his next field
of study should be.

14:56.395 --> 15:00.356
For your information, I was asking her
about the next Star Trek movie.

15:00.524 --> 15:04.152
I'll be bored.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.487
All right, why don't we begin?

15:14.496 --> 15:18.750
Your spirit guides are telling me
that there's a woman in your life

15:18.918 --> 15:22.712
- you're having problems with.
- That's an easy guess.

15:22.880 --> 15:26.716
I'm clearly an annoying person
and have problems with both genders.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.802
Yes, you clearly are.

15:31.305 --> 15:34.057
But I'm seeing a specific woman

15:34.224 --> 15:36.684
that you're in a romantic
relationship with.

15:36.852 --> 15:38.978
Oh, oh, here we go.

15:40.230 --> 15:42.273
- Does she have dark hair?
- Yes! Yes!

15:42.441 --> 15:45.234
Your spirit guides are on fire!

15:45.402 --> 15:47.779
The majority of people
have dark hair.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.822
Even you, at one time.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.909
Does she work
in a similar field to you?

15:53.077 --> 15:54.577
Ha! The opposite.

15:54.745 --> 15:57.705
She's a neurobiologist,
and I'm a theoretical physicist.

15:57.873 --> 16:00.541
My spirit guides can go suck an egg.

16:01.251 --> 16:05.004
They're telling me that you have
difficulty being close with her.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.423
Oh, he does. He so does.
What should he do?

16:11.720 --> 16:13.930
He should give himself
to this relationship.

16:14.098 --> 16:18.267
Once he does, all his other pursuits
will come into focus.

16:18.435 --> 16:21.896
Sheldon, do you hear that? I mean,
Amy is the key to your happiness.

16:22.064 --> 16:25.274
Exactly.
Personally and professionally.

16:25.442 --> 16:28.987
Everything will fall into place
once you commit to her.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.286
You know what this is?

16:37.454 --> 16:39.622
Yeah, and I reserve this word
for those rare instances

16:39.790 --> 16:41.165
when it's truly deserved.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.334
This is malarkey!

16:48.007 --> 16:49.966
Wow, you really struck a nerve.

16:50.134 --> 16:52.510
I've never heard him use
the "M" word before.

16:57.725 --> 17:01.310
Here we go.
House of a 1000 Corpses.

17:01.478 --> 17:04.105
Now, just so you know,
I was a nanny for three years,

17:04.273 --> 17:07.442
so if you get scared,
I can totally change your diaper.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.279
Actually, I have to
tell you something.

17:11.447 --> 17:14.115
These kind of movies
really aren't my thing,

17:14.283 --> 17:17.952
so, last night, I watched it just
to see what I was getting myself into.

17:18.120 --> 17:20.246
- Okay.
- And I have to be honest.

17:20.414 --> 17:23.916
I thought it was disturbing
and weird,

17:24.084 --> 17:26.294
and it made me wonder what it says
about someone who enjoys it.

17:26.462 --> 17:28.504
I wonder that too.

17:28.672 --> 17:30.465
Then why do you
watch these things?

17:30.632 --> 17:33.301
Can I tell you something
without you judging me?

17:33.469 --> 17:35.136
Sure.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.180
They kind of turn me on.

17:37.347 --> 17:38.973
And play.

17:52.821 --> 17:55.531
Hello. I didn't expect you
this evening.

17:55.699 --> 17:59.160
Well, I was just feeling so bad
about lying to you the other night,

17:59.328 --> 18:01.996
I... wanted to make it up to you.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.123
And how do you propose to do that?

18:16.428 --> 18:18.638
Unless you have Gravity
on Blu-ray under that skirt,

18:18.806 --> 18:21.015
I don't know where
you're going with this.
