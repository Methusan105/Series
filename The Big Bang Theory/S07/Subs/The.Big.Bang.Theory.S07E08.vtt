WEBVTT

00:03.378 --> 00:05.421
- Hey, can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

00:05.588 --> 00:06.714
You've had this dart board
since I've known you.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.000
But I've never seen you play.

00:08.216 --> 00:10.426
Oh, we played... once.

00:10.593 --> 00:12.302
I broke a window.

00:12.470 --> 00:13.512
What window?

00:13.680 --> 00:15.264
That one over there.

00:16.599 --> 00:18.809
Leonard,
where are the Skee-Ball tickets?

00:18.977 --> 00:20.144
Skee-Ball tickets?

00:20.311 --> 00:22.563
Yeah, from when we went
to the arcade three years ago?

00:22.731 --> 00:24.440
I finally decided what prize I want.

00:26.693 --> 00:27.735
Hurry up.

00:29.154 --> 00:32.448
If I still have them,
they're probably in the junk box.

00:32.615 --> 00:35.117
- Ooh, what are you gonna get?
- None of your business.

00:35.285 --> 00:38.620
But when you see me wearing
a flower in my lapel later,

00:38.788 --> 00:40.748
you are most welcome to sniff it.

00:42.792 --> 00:45.461
- Yup, got 'em, here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

00:45.628 --> 00:48.380
Here, get yourself an eraser
for your troubles.

00:51.676 --> 00:53.343
Oh, I forgot about this.

00:53.928 --> 00:56.221
My aunt made it for me
when I started college.

00:59.267 --> 01:01.894
Aw, did she hate you?

01:02.854 --> 01:04.855
Why? Because I got an ugly,
itchy sweater,

01:05.023 --> 01:07.566
and my brother got a car?
No, I was her favorite.

01:08.818 --> 01:10.338
Yeah, I seem to be
a few tickets short.

01:10.445 --> 01:11.779
Are there more in the box?

01:12.030 --> 01:13.655
I think I got them all.

01:13.823 --> 01:15.574
Nope, they're not in there.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.659
Well, you barely looked. Let me see.

01:17.827 --> 01:21.497
No, no, no, I looked, and...
No more tickets.

01:21.664 --> 01:23.916
- Leonard, let me look in the box.
- Okay, Okay!

01:24.834 --> 01:28.921
I'm gonna show you what's in the box.
But just... promise not to flip out?

01:29.089 --> 01:32.758
Why would I flip out? Is it a spider?

01:32.926 --> 01:34.176
It's a spider!

01:35.553 --> 01:39.515
No, if it was a spider,
Lenny would've flipped out.

01:39.682 --> 01:43.602
Okay, Sheldon, I know I was supposed
to return this DVD a long time ago,

01:43.770 --> 01:45.687
and I know we
rented it on your card.

01:45.855 --> 01:47.856
But it's been, like, seven years,

01:48.024 --> 01:49.504
and clearly nothing bad has happened.

01:49.651 --> 01:53.904
So instead of being a giant
pain in the ass, like you always are,

01:54.072 --> 01:58.200
what if this one time
you just tried staying calm?

02:04.124 --> 02:05.707
That seems like a reasonable request.

02:07.669 --> 02:10.546
Although so did, "Hey, Leonard,
would you mind returning that DVD?"

02:12.549 --> 02:14.466
I'm sorry. I'll take care of it.

02:15.510 --> 02:16.885
Okay.

02:17.804 --> 02:18.846
I mean it. I'm going to.

02:20.890 --> 02:22.641
I believe you.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.978
And you're going to stay calm?

02:27.188 --> 02:28.188
I said I would.

02:33.403 --> 02:34.403
How about that?

02:36.906 --> 02:38.657
Sheldon's being reasonable.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.868
Yeah, it's freaking me out.
I'm gonna go.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.064
So... when you say

03:11.232 --> 03:13.734
you're not going
to freak out about the DVD,

03:13.902 --> 03:15.485
here's what that means.

03:16.654 --> 03:18.071
Don't fixate on it,

03:18.239 --> 03:20.032
don't wake me up
in the middle of the night,

03:20.200 --> 03:23.452
or nag me through the door
while I'm on the toilet.

03:24.787 --> 03:27.331
Okay, first, talking to you
while you're on the toilet

03:27.498 --> 03:29.791
isn't exactly a picnic for me either.

03:30.501 --> 03:33.670
Remember, when you can hear me,
I can hear you.

03:35.423 --> 03:37.674
And, second,
you completely disregard

03:37.842 --> 03:40.677
how uncomfortable
unresolved issues are for me.

03:40.845 --> 03:44.348
It's like, an itch in my brain
I can't scratch.

03:45.308 --> 03:48.769
When I broke my arm I used
to stick a coat hanger down there.

03:51.314 --> 03:53.941
You ever try that?
Maybe go in through the ear?

03:54.067 --> 03:56.485
You wouldn't make jokes
if you could feel the way I feel.

03:57.153 --> 03:58.946
Well, I don't know how to do that.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.449
How about this?

04:02.617 --> 04:05.369
I promise I won't pester you
about the DVD.

04:05.536 --> 04:09.998
You can defecate in peace.
That's a win for both of us.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.500
But...

04:11.668 --> 04:13.961
until this matter is resolved,

04:14.128 --> 04:15.504
I would like you

04:15.672 --> 04:17.339
to wear this sweater.

04:20.051 --> 04:22.219
With nothing underneath it.

04:24.514 --> 04:25.847
That's stupid. Why?

04:26.015 --> 04:28.767
You say it's itchy and uncomfortable.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.728
I say situations like this
make me feel the same way.

04:31.896 --> 04:34.564
I'm telling you, try the hanger.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.276
Put it on.

04:37.443 --> 04:38.902
Let's share the experience.

04:40.571 --> 04:42.447
You got it.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.992
If this sweater shuts you up,
I'm gonna make a fortune

04:45.118 --> 04:46.952
selling them to everyone we know.

04:48.871 --> 04:50.455
Now all I need to do

04:50.581 --> 04:52.833
is head down to the video store

04:53.042 --> 04:55.002
and return the DVD.

04:58.881 --> 05:01.383
Oh, did I forget to tell you?

05:01.551 --> 05:04.803
That store went out
of business years ago.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.433
Really?

05:11.144 --> 05:12.686
How those nipples feeling, chief?

05:16.899 --> 05:18.525
Penny, can we please get our drinks?

05:18.693 --> 05:19.973
Yeah, hang on, just give me sec.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.697
At work today, I did
an in vivo stereotaxic surgery.

05:23.865 --> 05:27.409
Cool. At my lab, I performed
ten laser capture micro-dissections.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.704
I scraped gum
off the bottom of that table.

05:30.872 --> 05:33.707
Only because my manager
saw me put it there.

05:34.542 --> 05:35.584
Oh, my gosh.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.753
That's the girl
that broke Rajesh's heart.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.004
That's Lucy?

05:39.172 --> 05:41.465
I don't know why but I always
pictured her as Indian.

05:41.632 --> 05:43.675
I think that reason's called racism.

05:45.553 --> 05:46.553
I'm gonna go talk to her.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.597
Why? What are you gonna say?

05:48.765 --> 05:50.766
I'm not gonna say anything.
I just want to check her out.

05:50.933 --> 05:54.895
Because she hurt my friend.
My Indian friend.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.605
Who's racist now?

05:56.773 --> 06:00.192
You because you just called him
your "Indian friend."

06:02.111 --> 06:03.445
Yeah, well, you're short.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.158
We're never getting our drinks.

06:08.326 --> 06:10.035
No, but we knew that.

06:11.329 --> 06:12.954
Hey, can I start you off
with something to drink?

06:13.122 --> 06:15.332
- Oh, water would be great.
- Okay.

06:16.709 --> 06:19.336
You're Lucy, right?
I'm a friend of Raj Koothrappali's.

06:19.504 --> 06:20.962
Actually Amy recognized you.

06:28.971 --> 06:30.806
Wow. How's he doing?

06:30.973 --> 06:32.349
Oh, you know, he's good.

06:32.517 --> 06:33.517
Great.

06:33.684 --> 06:35.811
Yeah, this is none of my business.

06:35.978 --> 06:38.897
But why did you break up
with him in an e-mail?

06:39.816 --> 06:41.316
Oh, I don't know.

06:41.484 --> 06:43.318
I guess I thought it would be easier.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.321
Yeah, I get that.
I'll go get you your water.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.827
When you say "easier,"

06:51.994 --> 06:53.578
you mean easier for you, right?

06:53.746 --> 06:55.747
'Cause it certainly
didn't make it easier for him.

06:56.624 --> 07:00.001
Any chance I can get
a different waitress?

07:00.169 --> 07:02.249
I'm sorry, this is rude of me.
I will get that water.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.341
See, see, see, see.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.593
Just now you expressed
your feelings to my face.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.303
How come you could do that
with me, but not with Raj?

07:10.471 --> 07:12.681
I don't know your e-mail.

07:14.350 --> 07:16.685
You know what the worst part is?
You're sitting here, perfectly happy

07:16.853 --> 07:18.687
and he's at home, a blubbering mess.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.255
Oh, I thought you said he was okay.

07:20.356 --> 07:23.196
I also said I was getting you water,
but look at me still standing here.

07:24.944 --> 07:27.946
You know, I may be a bad waitress,
but you are a bad person.

07:28.114 --> 07:31.199
Now, you want to hear the specials?

07:51.179 --> 07:54.306
- So, you can never take it off?
- No.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.557
Not even to sleep?

07:55.725 --> 07:56.975
No.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.977
So, you're just an idiot?

08:00.855 --> 08:02.230
It's called proving a point.

08:02.398 --> 08:04.191
Is the point you're an idiot?

08:05.693 --> 08:07.152
Gentlemen, please.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.864
Leonard is trying to walk
a mile in my metaphorical shoes.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.158
He can't walk in my actual shoes.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.035
He has the feet of a toddler.

08:17.163 --> 08:20.165
So, how are you gonna return the DVD
if the store went out of business?

08:21.125 --> 08:24.544
Monday morning I'll go downtown,
look up the owner's information,

08:24.712 --> 08:27.214
send him the DVD.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.760
Pay the late fee...

08:31.928 --> 08:34.054
and prove to Sheldon
that you can have a problem...

08:34.222 --> 08:35.764
and solve it...

08:37.391 --> 08:39.976
without acting
like a complete lunatic.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.353
Ahh!

08:42.730 --> 08:45.106
And the man impersonating a bear
would like everyone to know that,

08:45.274 --> 08:47.442
Only you can prevent forest fires.

08:50.404 --> 08:51.404
I don't get it.

08:52.073 --> 08:53.740
You didn't have
Smokey the Bear in India?

08:53.908 --> 08:56.535
No. Oh, is he anything like
Mun-Mun the Mongoose?

08:58.204 --> 09:00.330
He taught us not to play with cobras.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.501
You had to be taught
not to play with cobras?

09:06.587 --> 09:08.922
You had to be taught
not to burn down the forest?

09:18.474 --> 09:21.184
If you guys were hungry, why didn't
you order at the restaurant?

09:21.352 --> 09:23.103
We did.
You never brought it.

09:25.273 --> 09:27.023
Oh, that's right.

09:27.191 --> 09:28.858
Nachos and a turkey club.

09:29.026 --> 09:30.443
Not even close.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.114
Well, I was too busy
standing up for my friend

09:34.282 --> 09:35.991
to worry about your...

09:36.158 --> 09:38.368
I want to say salmon.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.370
You want to say sorry.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.589
So, how are you gonna
tell Raj abut what you did?

09:48.629 --> 09:50.171
What do you mean "how"?
What's the big deal?

09:50.339 --> 09:52.424
You told Lucy he was a pathetic mess.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.467
Then you made her cry and leave.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.386
Okay, you guys are overreacting.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.847
Raj is gonna appreciate
how I had his back.

09:59.015 --> 10:01.349
What is wrong with you, Penny?!

10:01.517 --> 10:04.477
You ruined any chance I had
of getting back with Lucy!

10:05.229 --> 10:07.147
Now she knows I'm a desperate mess

10:07.231 --> 10:08.982
instead of just being pretty sure!

10:11.485 --> 10:13.069
It's Lucy.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.821
She wants to meet for coffee.

10:14.989 --> 10:17.157
I love you, Penny!

10:22.079 --> 10:24.497
Hey, what are you working on?

10:25.249 --> 10:27.876
I'm thinking about
how one could use the fact

10:28.044 --> 10:32.047
that a rapidly rotating mirror
turns virtual photons into real ones

10:32.214 --> 10:34.758
as a method of observing dark energy.

10:34.925 --> 10:36.509
That's a pretty cool idea.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.470
Yeah. It's great you're here.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.221
I'd love to get
an engineer's opinion.

10:40.389 --> 10:41.431
Sure.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.767
This chair is squeaky.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.731
Now, do I fix it or get a new one?

10:51.359 --> 10:53.777
Well, Sheldon,
it took me all morning,

10:53.944 --> 10:56.237
but I found the owner
of the video store.

10:56.405 --> 10:59.074
And I am happy to report
that he died peacefully in his sleep,

10:59.241 --> 11:00.909
drunk at the bottom of a pool.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.413
Anyway, there is no one
to return the DVD to,

11:05.581 --> 11:08.833
so this issue is resolved.

11:11.837 --> 11:13.755
And I'd just like to point out that

11:13.923 --> 11:15.715
even though the sweater
was uncomfortable,

11:15.883 --> 11:19.719
I didn't use it as an excuse
to antagonize everyone around me.

11:19.887 --> 11:23.098
You know, you could reimburse
the video store owner's next of kin.

11:23.265 --> 11:25.642
Or it's resolved!

11:27.770 --> 11:29.729
Hey, that next of kin thing
sounds pretty good.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.233
I believe this is yours.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.157
Can I ask you guys a question?

11:41.325 --> 11:43.868
So, I'm seeing Lucy tomorrow night,
and I've never hung out

11:44.036 --> 11:46.121
with someone who broke up with me.
How do you do it?

11:46.288 --> 11:49.249
You can't let her know you're
hurting. The key is confidence.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.543
Why is the key always confidence?

11:51.711 --> 11:55.046
How come it's never
love handles and flop sweat?

11:57.591 --> 12:00.093
If this girl hurt you so much, are
you sure you want to see her again?

12:00.261 --> 12:02.929
Well, if I may,
he has so little self-respect

12:03.097 --> 12:05.432
and is so desperate
for the smallest crumb of affection,

12:05.558 --> 12:07.918
she could literally sleep
with his own father in his own bed

12:08.018 --> 12:10.687
and post the video to YouTube,
and he'd still buy her flowers

12:10.855 --> 12:12.772
and ask her to be his bride.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.026
He's right.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.948
But in my defense,
if we could survive that,

12:22.116 --> 12:23.658
we could survive anything.

12:25.661 --> 12:27.620
Well, if you're sure you want
to do this, it's only coffee.

12:27.788 --> 12:29.956
Just relax and see what happens.

12:30.541 --> 12:32.834
- Well, can I say she looks nice?
- Sure.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.502
Can I tell her I miss her?

12:34.670 --> 12:36.504
Maybe, if she asks.

12:36.672 --> 12:38.381
Can I show her
an oil painting I made of us

12:38.549 --> 12:40.967
surrounded by our children
and grandchildren?

12:43.512 --> 12:45.972
I'd save that for the second date.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.808
Good, good,
'cause no matter how hard I try,

12:48.976 --> 12:51.394
I cannot get the twins to look alike.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.027
What are you doing?

12:59.195 --> 13:01.863
Oh, I'm just trying to find
the stupid next of kin

13:02.031 --> 13:05.200
to this stupid video store owner,
so I can return the DVD

13:05.367 --> 13:07.994
and see the look
on Sheldon's stupid face

13:08.162 --> 13:11.247
when he sees that I didn't
let this get to me.

13:13.083 --> 13:15.244
Sheldon's not here.
Why don't you take the sweater off?

13:15.252 --> 13:17.670
- There's a principle at stake!
- Which is?

13:17.838 --> 13:20.381
Oh, I don't know.
Who cares? Look at me!

13:21.801 --> 13:23.760
Oh, my God!
Is that sweater made of bees?

13:25.095 --> 13:26.930
Come on, take it off. I won't tell.

13:27.097 --> 13:29.182
No, no, honey, if I take it off,
Sheldon wins.

13:29.350 --> 13:34.145
Sweetie, every night you don't
kill him in his sleep, he wins.

13:35.564 --> 13:37.482
No, it's almost done.

13:37.650 --> 13:41.194
I just... I have to find
the next of kin, and send 'em the DVD

13:41.362 --> 13:43.563
and then just wait for someone
with my complexion to die

13:43.614 --> 13:45.365
so I can get a skin graft.

13:46.659 --> 13:47.867
Smile.

13:48.619 --> 13:49.859
What is that? What is that for?

13:49.995 --> 13:52.956
So you can send it to Princeton
and get your money back.

13:57.461 --> 14:00.046
I must say, Sheldon,
you're handling this DVD business

14:00.214 --> 14:01.840
with an impressive amount
of maturity.

14:02.591 --> 14:05.635
I don't know why that surprises you.
I'm a grown man.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.762
As should be evident
by this sport coat

14:07.930 --> 14:10.640
and very real flower in my lapel.

14:11.976 --> 14:15.270
Is there some kind of new coping
mechanism you're employing?

14:15.437 --> 14:17.939
The more interesting question
you should be asking is,

14:18.107 --> 14:20.775
"What does this flower smell like?"

14:22.319 --> 14:23.611
I'm gonna go with sad.

14:25.614 --> 14:27.615
So what's the story
with you and this DVD?

14:27.783 --> 14:29.450
There's nothing to tell.

14:29.618 --> 14:31.202
Maybe I purchased a book entitled,

14:31.370 --> 14:32.787
Don't Sweat the Small Stuff

14:32.955 --> 14:36.749
and I followed its wise suggestions,
one of which was:

14:36.917 --> 14:38.960
stop and smell the flowers.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.715
- Seriously?
- Please.

14:49.430 --> 14:50.805
Haha!

14:59.815 --> 15:01.316
- Hi.
- Hello.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.485
- Oh, it's so good to see you.
- You, too.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.779
Please, sit.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.437
I got you a cappuccino.
I remembered it was your favorite.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.492
I also got crumb cake,

15:11.744 --> 15:13.703
but remembered
it was my favorite, and I ate it.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.415
Anyway, how are you?

15:18.375 --> 15:19.834
I'm pretty good.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.794
Listen, I just wanted to apologize

15:21.962 --> 15:24.130
for breaking up with you
in an e-mail.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.380
And I ate all the crumb cake.
We both made mistakes.

15:27.801 --> 15:28.968
Okay.

15:29.136 --> 15:31.095
I'm so happy you asked me here,

15:31.263 --> 15:33.306
and I hope we can hang out
again sometime.

15:34.016 --> 15:37.143
You know, as friends,
lovemaking partners, whatever.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.438
Oh...

15:40.564 --> 15:42.649
I'm kind of seeing someone.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.235
I think I know the answer to this,

15:46.403 --> 15:49.280
but just to be clear,
it's not me, right?

15:51.241 --> 15:52.700
This is all your fault!

15:53.827 --> 15:55.828
I should've listened to Mun-Mun
because I've been playing

15:55.996 --> 15:58.039
with a cobra and her name is Penny!

15:59.458 --> 16:02.168
Why are you so cruel?
Do you enjoy my pain?

16:02.294 --> 16:04.337
There's a girl at the Cheesecake
Factory I can set you up with.

16:04.546 --> 16:06.047
I love you, Penny!

16:09.635 --> 16:12.387
How is it I can conceptualize
a methodology

16:12.554 --> 16:14.555
of examining dark matter
in the universe

16:14.723 --> 16:17.809
but can't figure out how
to fix a novelty squirt flower?

16:19.019 --> 16:20.520
I think the real question is,

16:20.688 --> 16:23.648
why do you waste your time
with cheap, childish pranks?

16:24.400 --> 16:26.109
There's probably a deep reason,

16:26.276 --> 16:28.319
which I'd be happy
to discuss with you

16:28.487 --> 16:30.780
over some peanut brittle in a can.

16:32.116 --> 16:34.283
Okay, Sheldon, I am out of options!

16:34.451 --> 16:37.453
Video store owner, Nursis Manookian,

16:37.621 --> 16:38.871
has no next of kin!

16:39.456 --> 16:42.041
Well, you seem hot
under the collar...

16:42.209 --> 16:43.960
or is that the sweater?

16:44.586 --> 16:47.380
Oh, oh, no, no.
It's because I spent all afternoon

16:47.548 --> 16:49.841
at the Armenian church
where his funeral mass was held.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.801
According to Father Solakian,

16:51.969 --> 16:53.428
no one attended.

16:53.595 --> 16:55.304
Luckily, my trip
wasn't a complete waste.

16:55.472 --> 16:56.723
I lit a candle
and prayed for your death.

16:56.890 --> 16:59.308
But I'm not Armenian,
so it probably won't work!

17:01.770 --> 17:03.271
This is over, right?

17:03.439 --> 17:05.148
Oh, not necessarily.

17:06.108 --> 17:09.318
I suggest you look
for long-lost relatives

17:09.486 --> 17:12.113
either in Armenia or Lebanon.

17:14.241 --> 17:15.783
Listen to me, Sheldon.

17:15.951 --> 17:17.827
I am not going to Lebanon

17:17.995 --> 17:21.622
to return
Super Mario Bros. the movie!

17:23.292 --> 17:26.753
Anyway, it might be fun.
You love hummus.

17:28.672 --> 17:30.506
Why isn't this bothering you?

17:30.674 --> 17:32.675
Isn't your brain getting itchy?

17:32.843 --> 17:35.136
This is on your card.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.388
This could be ruining
your credit score!

17:37.556 --> 17:40.475
Why isn't this making you crazy?

17:42.352 --> 17:43.561
Leonard...

17:45.314 --> 17:47.315
I have something to tell you,

17:47.483 --> 17:50.318
but I want you to promise
not to flip out.

17:50.486 --> 17:51.652
What?

17:53.655 --> 17:55.073
Seven years ago,

17:55.240 --> 17:58.159
I found out the DVD was late
and I paid for it.

18:06.794 --> 18:07.960
What?

18:09.379 --> 18:11.005
I was going to mention it
at the time,

18:11.173 --> 18:13.508
but then I thought, some day,

18:14.635 --> 18:17.261
this might be a teachable moment.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.152
Ahh!

18:40.577 --> 18:43.538
But I...?! You...?! How...?!

18:43.705 --> 18:45.039
What?!

18:50.212 --> 18:53.131
Sheldon, that was diabolical.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.299
I know.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.261
And it wasn't easy.

18:58.428 --> 19:02.098
Do you have any idea what it's like
to wait for years,

19:02.307 --> 19:04.892
and never know if you're going
to finally get satisfaction?

19:12.067 --> 19:13.317
Wow.

19:13.485 --> 19:15.153
You're even prettier than Penny said.

19:15.320 --> 19:18.072
I can't believe a girl like you
doesn't have a boyfriend.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.282
Well, I don't.

19:19.449 --> 19:21.576
I don't believe you.
You're lying to me!

19:22.578 --> 19:24.078
What?

19:24.246 --> 19:26.622
It's okay. I have no morals,
and I'm desperately lonely.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.875
I'll be the other man if you want
a little something-something

19:29.042 --> 19:30.626
on the side.

19:30.794 --> 19:36.799
What is wrong with you?!
