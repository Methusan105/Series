WEBVTT

00:05.714 --> 00:07.339
Boy, do I have to urinate.

00:08.883 --> 00:10.926
If only there were a solution
to that.

00:12.220 --> 00:15.097
Seriously. I feel like I've got
a fish tank in my pelvis.

00:17.183 --> 00:18.559
So go to the bathroom.

00:18.727 --> 00:19.893
I can't.

00:20.186 --> 00:21.562
Why not?

00:22.022 --> 00:26.525
Because I'm trying to decide
between getting an Xbox One or a PS4.

00:27.777 --> 00:29.987
Oh, "pee." Why'd I say that?

00:32.782 --> 00:34.658
Forgive me for asking
a stupid question,

00:34.826 --> 00:36.493
but why are you being stupid?

00:37.954 --> 00:39.371
I'm not being stupid.

00:39.539 --> 00:42.458
I'm employing the work
of Dutch researcher, Mirjam Tuk,

00:42.625 --> 00:45.502
who found that people with full
bladders make better decisions.

00:46.921 --> 00:49.923
Why did I pee before I decided
to move in here?

00:51.843 --> 00:53.927
- Hi!
- Hey. How'd the audition go?

00:54.095 --> 00:56.889
I killed it. I was even able
to cry real tears right on the spot.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.182
- That's great.
- I know.

00:58.349 --> 00:59.975
Next time I get pulled over
for a speeding ticket,

01:00.143 --> 01:01.560
here come the waterworks.

01:01.978 --> 01:03.562
Here come the waterworks!

01:08.943 --> 01:11.236
- Aren't you gonna ask?
- What is this, my first day?

01:38.223 --> 01:40.474
Can I get your opinion on something
that happened at work today?

01:40.642 --> 01:41.809
- Yeah, sure.
- Of course.

01:41.976 --> 01:45.479
I did something that will either
make me look like a lovable goof

01:45.647 --> 01:48.690
or a horrible monster damned
to spend eternity in hell.

01:50.527 --> 01:51.652
I'm sure it's lovable.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.779
I'm gonna go with monster.
What do you got?

01:55.198 --> 01:57.278
Well, there's this lady
in our office who's retiring,

01:57.408 --> 01:59.827
and they were passing around one of
those big cards for us to sign...

01:59.994 --> 02:00.994
Okay.

02:01.162 --> 02:04.540
No one told me she was in a horrible
car accident over the weekend

02:04.707 --> 02:06.917
and what I was signing
was not a retirement card

02:07.085 --> 02:08.836
but was actually a "get well" card.

02:09.003 --> 02:11.547
I'm liking my odds here.

02:13.216 --> 02:15.676
So on the card, in the hospital,

02:15.844 --> 02:18.554
next to the woman who's clinging
to life are the words,

02:18.721 --> 02:20.848
"Hey, Vivian. You deserve this.

02:25.019 --> 02:26.562
And at least with you gone,

02:26.729 --> 02:28.570
no one will steal my yogurt
out of the fridge."

02:28.690 --> 02:30.315
No!

02:32.610 --> 02:33.819
"LOL. Smiley face."

02:33.987 --> 02:35.863
Oh, my gosh.

02:36.614 --> 02:38.365
"P.S.
Good luck wherever you wind up."

02:40.493 --> 02:42.703
Why didn't I put money on this?

02:45.248 --> 02:46.832
Hey, that's my agent.
If I got the part,

02:47.000 --> 02:50.169
it's still the second best thing
I've heard all day. Hello?

02:50.587 --> 02:51.879
Am I a terrible person?

02:52.046 --> 02:54.423
No. No, it was a mistake.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.133
Am I a terrible person
that it crossed my mind

02:56.301 --> 02:58.177
that she might die
and never see the card?

02:58.595 --> 03:00.596
Now I think you're flirting
with the line.

03:01.931 --> 03:03.974
- Good news?
- No, I didn't get it.

03:04.142 --> 03:05.392
I'm so sorry.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.186
You'll get offered something soon.

03:07.353 --> 03:09.646
I kind of did. The part
in that awful horror movie

03:09.814 --> 03:11.315
I passed on came back around.

03:11.482 --> 03:13.233
Apparently, it's mine if I want it.

03:13.401 --> 03:14.526
Are you gonna take it?

03:14.694 --> 03:16.069
I don't know what to do.

03:16.237 --> 03:18.155
Maybe you'll get hit
by a car and die.

03:21.451 --> 03:22.618
LOL, right?

03:30.001 --> 03:31.543
Hey. Emily, right?

03:32.462 --> 03:33.462
Yeah.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.839
I don't know if you remember me.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.674
From the dating website.

03:37.842 --> 03:40.052
Your friend emailed me
because you were afraid to,

03:40.220 --> 03:41.970
then you tracked me down
and acted like a lunatic?

03:42.138 --> 03:44.056
Yes, Rajesh Koothrappali.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.769
Look, I just...
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

03:49.812 --> 03:52.481
You were, like, the coolest person
I ever found online,

03:52.649 --> 03:56.443
and I got really nervous
and I just blew it.

03:57.487 --> 03:58.612
Don't worry about it.

03:59.447 --> 04:00.989
And if it makes you feel any better,

04:01.157 --> 04:03.450
you're not the weirdest guy
I've met off the Internet.

04:03.618 --> 04:07.120
Well, give me a chance,
you don't even know me.

04:09.499 --> 04:12.292
All right, here's your chance.

04:12.752 --> 04:14.503
What? Really?

04:15.588 --> 04:16.713
Thank you.

04:16.881 --> 04:18.401
Fate has given me
a rare second chance,

04:18.508 --> 04:20.300
and I swear to Vishnu
I'm not gonna blow it.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.929
Or normal words
followed by a charming smile.

04:29.644 --> 04:32.229
First there was PlayStation,
aka PS1,

04:32.397 --> 04:35.399
then PS2, PS3 and now PS4.

04:35.566 --> 04:36.692
And that makes sense.

04:36.859 --> 04:39.361
You'd think after Xbox,
there'd be Xbox 2.

04:39.529 --> 04:43.282
But no, next came Xbox 360. Hm?

04:43.408 --> 04:46.451
And now, after 360, comes Xbox One.

04:47.954 --> 04:48.954
Why "One"?

04:49.872 --> 04:52.432
Maybe that's how many seconds
of thought they put into naming it.

04:53.626 --> 04:54.918
Can you get the butter, please?

04:55.086 --> 04:57.671
You know, however,
with the Xbox One,

04:57.839 --> 05:00.090
I can control
my entire entertainment system

05:00.258 --> 05:01.675
using voice commands.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.844
Up until now,
I've had to use Leonard.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.639
Then get the other one.
Pass the butter.

05:08.224 --> 05:09.766
Hang on.

05:09.934 --> 05:12.477
I don't feel like you're taking
this dilemma seriously.

05:13.896 --> 05:15.272
Fine, Sheldon.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.190
You have my undivided attention.

05:17.442 --> 05:21.903
Okay, now, the PS4 is
more angular and sleek-looking.

05:22.071 --> 05:23.989
- No way.
- Yeah.

05:24.157 --> 05:27.075
It's true. But the larger size
of the Xbox One

05:27.243 --> 05:28.535
may keep it from overheating.

05:28.703 --> 05:30.954
You wouldn't want
your gaming system to overheat.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.998
Well, you absolutely would not.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.877
And furthermore, the Xbox One
now comes with a Kinect included.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.920
- Included?
- Yes!

05:40.089 --> 05:41.590
Not sold separately.

05:41.758 --> 05:46.053
Although, the PS4
uses cool new GDDR5 RAM,

05:46.220 --> 05:49.264
while the Xbox One is still using
the conventional DDR3 memory.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.266
Why would they still
be using DDR3?

05:51.434 --> 05:52.934
Are they nuts?

05:54.771 --> 05:56.063
See? That's what I thought.

05:56.230 --> 05:58.732
But then they go and throw in
an ESRAM buffer.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.985
- Whoa. Wait a second. Who's "they"?
- Xbox.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.613
- You're kidding!
- No, I am not!

06:04.781 --> 06:06.948
And this ESRAM buffer
should totally bridge

06:07.116 --> 06:08.784
the 100-gigabit-per-second
bandwidth gap

06:08.951 --> 06:10.077
between the two RAM types.

06:10.244 --> 06:12.621
This is a nightmare.
How will you ever make a decision?

06:12.789 --> 06:14.831
I don't know!
What should I do?

06:14.999 --> 06:16.833
Please pass the butter!

06:27.428 --> 06:29.763
Okay, it's not me, right?
This script is terrible.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.223
Yeah.

06:32.308 --> 06:34.142
I had higher hopes for a movie called

06:34.310 --> 06:37.312
Monkey See, Monkey Kill.

06:40.525 --> 06:43.568
You know, it's still possible
for you to be good in a bad movie.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.070
Okay.

06:47.031 --> 06:48.782
"Sometimes I feel like I can control

06:48.950 --> 06:50.784
the killer gorilla instinct
inside of me,

06:50.952 --> 06:52.744
but then I see these bananas

06:52.912 --> 06:55.831
and I just want to eat them
and then kill people."

07:00.002 --> 07:01.420
What am I gonna do?

07:01.587 --> 07:04.923
Well, for starters,
I wouldn't eat the bananas.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.676
Come on! This is serious.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.928
Does it at least pay well?

07:10.096 --> 07:12.139
Less than I was making
at The Cheesecake Factory.

07:12.640 --> 07:13.721
What does your agent think?

07:13.808 --> 07:16.143
She's thinking of taking a job
at The Cheesecake Factory.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.355
You know what,
why don't you just do it?

07:20.523 --> 07:22.858
You'll go have fun for a few weeks,
make some money,

07:23.025 --> 07:24.943
and who knows what it might lead to?

07:25.111 --> 07:26.361
Okay, look, here, page 58.

07:26.529 --> 07:29.072
I oil-wrestle an orangutan
in a bikini.

07:30.533 --> 07:33.493
Just to clarify, which one
of you is wearing the bikini?

07:34.537 --> 07:36.204
Both of us.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.291
So it's a family film.

07:42.879 --> 07:44.504
Thank you again for dinner.

07:44.672 --> 07:45.672
You're welcome.

07:45.840 --> 07:49.259
- Good night.
- Uh, it's date night.

07:49.427 --> 07:52.053
Aren't you forgetting something?

07:53.389 --> 07:54.848
Oh, of course.

08:02.190 --> 08:05.066
Did I mention
the PS4 controllers light up?

08:08.237 --> 08:09.571
No.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.573
Well, they do.

08:16.245 --> 08:18.205
And then after coffee,
we went for a walk

08:18.372 --> 08:20.412
and she told me she always
thought people from India

08:20.416 --> 08:21.917
were exotic and mysterious.

08:22.084 --> 08:24.836
So, with my mouth, I said,
"We're just like anybody else,"

08:25.004 --> 08:26.463
but with my eyes, I said,

08:26.631 --> 08:28.715
"Straight up, Red,
hop on my flying carpet."

08:32.345 --> 08:33.678
So, you gonna see her again?

08:33.846 --> 08:34.971
Yeah, we have plans this weekend.

08:35.139 --> 08:36.181
And if it's a clear night,

08:36.349 --> 08:39.267
I'm gonna lay
some romantic astronomy on her.

08:40.770 --> 08:41.978
Okay, like what? Show me.

08:42.146 --> 08:43.647
I can't do that to Leonard.

08:43.814 --> 08:46.149
This is some powerful
panty-dropping stuff.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.363
You have my blessing. Go for it.

08:51.989 --> 08:53.365
Okay.

08:55.243 --> 09:00.080
Penny, two of the brightest stars
in the night sky

09:00.248 --> 09:02.541
are Altair and Vega.

09:02.708 --> 09:05.043
And it is said
they were deeply in love

09:05.211 --> 09:09.464
but forever separated by the
celestial river of the Milky Way.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.466
- That's sad.
- It is.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.927
But once a year,

09:14.095 --> 09:16.721
on the seventh day
of the seventh month,

09:16.889 --> 09:21.268
Vega cries so hard that all
the magpies in the world fly up

09:21.435 --> 09:25.814
and create a bridge with their wings
so the two lovers can be together

09:25.982 --> 09:28.817
for a single night of passion.

09:30.486 --> 09:31.820
Wow.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.283
Okay, that's enough.

09:40.079 --> 09:43.790
PS4 or Xbox One?
Raj.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.125
- Xbox One.
- Penny.

09:45.293 --> 09:46.293
Huh?

09:47.336 --> 09:48.670
- Leonard.
- PS4.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.547
- Wolowitz.
- Both great.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.632
- Bernadette.
- I like the Wii.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.137
Thanks, Grandma.

09:59.974 --> 10:01.600
- Oh, my goodness.
- What's up?

10:01.767 --> 10:04.269
I just got an email
from my ex-girlfriend Lucy.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.022
She misses me
and wants to get together.

10:07.189 --> 10:10.942
Two women at the same time?
Nice job, playa!

10:13.321 --> 10:14.446
Really?

10:15.823 --> 10:18.825
Was it the "two women"
thing or the "playa"?

10:20.328 --> 10:22.037
It was the "playa".

10:26.500 --> 10:27.709
What am I supposed to do?

10:27.877 --> 10:30.587
How am I supposed to choose
between Emily and Lucy?

10:30.755 --> 10:32.839
Why do you have to choose?
Date both of them.

10:33.007 --> 10:35.091
I can't date two women at once.

10:35.259 --> 10:37.302
Zero women, that's my sweet spot.

10:39.221 --> 10:40.555
Unless you're sleeping
with one of them,

10:40.723 --> 10:42.223
seeing other people isn't a big deal.

10:42.391 --> 10:45.185
But what if one of them asks me
what I was up to the night before

10:45.353 --> 10:48.146
and I was with the other one?
Then, what, do I lie?

10:48.314 --> 10:50.065
- Yes.
- Yes.

10:52.568 --> 10:55.320
What do you mean, yes?

10:55.488 --> 10:57.572
Were you seeing other women
when we started dating?

10:57.740 --> 10:59.240
No. Were you seeing other men?

10:59.408 --> 11:00.575
No.

11:00.743 --> 11:01.826
Were you seeing other men?

11:01.994 --> 11:03.244
No.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.377
Aren't you gonna ask me?

11:12.755 --> 11:14.297
Come on, really?

11:17.677 --> 11:19.597
Thank you so much
for letting us pick your brain.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.888
Yeah, happy to help.
So, what's going on?

11:22.056 --> 11:24.933
Well, I'm having an impossible time
getting my career off the ground,

11:25.101 --> 11:27.268
and I got offered a role
in this crappy horror movie,

11:27.436 --> 11:29.076
and I just don't know
if I should take it.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.565
Well, I have certainly taken some
jobs that I've been embarrassed by.

11:32.733 --> 11:35.402
I wouldn't exactly call
Star Trek embarrassing.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.239
I wasn't.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.118
Me, either.

11:44.745 --> 11:48.123
So, what do you think, is there a
professional downside to doing it?

11:48.290 --> 11:49.624
Well, it's tricky.

11:49.792 --> 11:52.460
You want to take projects
that you're excited about,

11:52.628 --> 11:54.879
but sometimes you also
have to pay the bills.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.507
When you're on the set
working on something

11:57.675 --> 12:01.010
that you just know in your heart
is bad, not Star Trek...

12:02.722 --> 12:05.014
Yeah, beam me up. I love it!

12:07.476 --> 12:10.812
Anyway, those jobs
can be soul-crushing.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.689
That's what I'm afraid of.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.733
Well, I was in Stand By Me
when I was a kid,

12:14.900 --> 12:16.401
and it was a huge success.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.154
The terrible movies I did
came after that.

12:19.321 --> 12:20.989
Imagine how that feels.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.157
Sounds rough.

12:22.324 --> 12:24.576
I'm telling you,
this business is brutal.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.787
To this day,
I hate going on auditions.

12:27.955 --> 12:32.333
Okay, I walk in, and I can just
feel them thinking,

12:32.501 --> 12:35.587
"He was such a cute kid.
What happened to him?"

12:38.174 --> 12:42.010
And then I don't get the job,
and I can never find out why.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.181
Honestly, I get so depressed,
there are entire weeks

12:46.348 --> 12:48.641
that I can't even get out of bed.

12:51.979 --> 12:53.354
Okay, this was helpful.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.861
Any news on your co-worker
who's in the hospital?

13:00.029 --> 13:02.989
Poor thing,
she was in surgery for 18 hours.

13:03.157 --> 13:05.200
She's alive, but she's
still in critical condition.

13:05.367 --> 13:06.493
Oh, no.

13:06.660 --> 13:07.994
The one bit of good news
is they put her

13:08.162 --> 13:10.242
in a medically induced coma
before she read the card.

13:10.372 --> 13:12.415
So, you know, silver linings.

13:16.086 --> 13:18.129
Were you like this
when I married you?

13:21.425 --> 13:23.259
Don't worry about it, buddy.

13:23.427 --> 13:25.553
- Okay, bye.

13:25.679 --> 13:27.263
That was Wil,
he's feeling a lot better.

13:27.431 --> 13:30.642
Apparently, he's 12-down
in the TV Guide crossword puzzle.

13:32.603 --> 13:34.483
Did he help you make a decision
about the movie?

13:34.647 --> 13:37.565
No. Did you figure out what you're
gonna do about the two girls?

13:37.733 --> 13:39.234
As a matter of fact, I did.

13:39.401 --> 13:42.070
I've spent so many years
living in fear,

13:42.238 --> 13:44.823
saying no to new experiences,
but from now on,

13:44.990 --> 13:47.116
I'm gonna say yes.
Yes to love,

13:47.284 --> 13:49.244
yes to adventure, yes to life.
Whatever it may be,

13:49.328 --> 13:50.870
the answer's going to be yes.

13:52.289 --> 13:53.410
He's gonna die alone, right?

13:53.541 --> 13:54.999
- Yeah.
- Yes.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.254
I'm proud of you, Sheldon.

13:59.421 --> 14:00.880
You know, I'm proud of me, too.

14:01.048 --> 14:04.384
I've done all my research,
I conducted an informal poll,

14:04.552 --> 14:06.272
and I've arrived
at the rock-solid certainty

14:06.428 --> 14:07.595
I've made the right choice.

14:07.763 --> 14:09.243
Well, that's got to be
a good feeling.

14:09.265 --> 14:10.640
Oh, it is.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.600
- Although...
- Oh, crap.

14:14.395 --> 14:17.605
I had the same feeling when
I made my dad buy a Betamax

14:17.773 --> 14:19.440
instead of a VHS.

14:19.775 --> 14:21.442
You were just a little kid.

14:21.610 --> 14:22.944
A little kid
who picked the wrong format

14:23.112 --> 14:24.988
to record The MacNeil/Lehrer Report.

14:27.074 --> 14:31.244
I also was certain that HD DVD
would win out over Blu-ray.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.492
- How old were you then?
- Old enough to know better.

14:35.624 --> 14:38.877
And now that I think about it,
I stood in front of a case of iPods

14:39.044 --> 14:40.753
and I bought a Zune.

14:44.174 --> 14:45.300
What's a Zune?

14:45.467 --> 14:47.093
Yeah, exactly.

14:48.637 --> 14:51.806
It's an MP3 player
brought to us by the makers of Xbox.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.268
No, what are you doing?
No, pick that back up.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.395
You know it's good.
You did the research.

14:57.563 --> 14:58.897
But what if I'm wrong?

14:59.815 --> 15:02.859
You know what?
How about I buy it for you?

15:03.027 --> 15:05.320
How about I buy you both?

15:06.155 --> 15:07.906
You know I only have
one slot available

15:08.073 --> 15:09.282
on my entertainment center.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.326
Then I'll buy you
a new entertainment center.

15:11.493 --> 15:14.329
Yeah, okay, sure.
But which one?

15:16.457 --> 15:19.834
How about this?
I've heard that if you flip a coin,

15:20.002 --> 15:21.669
it will tell you how
you actually feel.

15:21.837 --> 15:23.277
Because you'll either
be disappointed

15:23.380 --> 15:25.048
or excited by the outcome.

15:25.215 --> 15:26.257
Interesting.

15:26.425 --> 15:29.677
So, heads it's PS4,
tails it's Xbox One.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.680
All right, I'll try.

15:37.061 --> 15:38.227
What is it?

15:38.562 --> 15:39.979
A quarter.

15:44.026 --> 15:46.194
Could have given it back to me.
That was a choice.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.621
You look really pretty tonight.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.998
Thanks. I love that jacket.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.708
Thank you. Thanks.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.463
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

16:05.631 --> 16:08.716
My ex-girlfriend emailed me,
and I'm seeing her Saturday.

16:08.884 --> 16:11.260
And I'm glad you like it,
it's from J. Crew.

16:13.597 --> 16:14.847
I don't understand.

16:15.015 --> 16:17.517
My friends told me it was okay to see
more than one person at a time,

16:17.685 --> 16:20.269
but it feels like
I'm being deceitful.

16:20.437 --> 16:21.980
Are you getting
back together with her?

16:23.065 --> 16:26.484
No. I have no idea.
What would you do?

16:27.611 --> 16:30.655
Usually on first dates,
I talk about music and stuff,

16:30.823 --> 16:32.503
but I was promised weird,
so let's do this.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.494
How serious were you two?

16:37.204 --> 16:38.871
Well, to be honest,

16:39.039 --> 16:42.250
we only went on four dates,
hugged twice, kissed once,

16:42.418 --> 16:45.420
and there was a handshake
loaded with sexual innuendo.

16:49.091 --> 16:52.844
Wait, a girl you never slept with
sent you an email

16:53.012 --> 16:55.638
and you felt so guilty about it
that you had to tell me?

16:55.806 --> 16:57.181
Yeah.

16:57.391 --> 16:58.766
That's kind of adorable.

16:59.935 --> 17:02.687
Are you sure?
Because this is the part of the night

17:02.855 --> 17:05.255
where I've said something stupid
and the girl usually leaves.

17:05.357 --> 17:06.858
I'm still here.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.569
Yeah, but now you make me wonder
what's wrong with you.

17:11.905 --> 17:13.239
We just met.

17:13.407 --> 17:15.867
You don't need to tell me about
other people you're seeing.

17:16.410 --> 17:17.827
Really?

17:17.995 --> 17:19.662
Because "I'm dating two women"

17:19.830 --> 17:23.082
is basically the only cool thing
I can say about myself.

17:34.344 --> 17:37.805
On the one hand, the Xbox One
has a better camera,

17:37.973 --> 17:40.600
but the PS4 has
a removable hard drive.

17:41.810 --> 17:43.144
Thoughts?

17:44.396 --> 17:46.022
I can't feel my legs.

17:48.984 --> 17:50.109
Oh...

17:50.152 --> 17:52.403
I'm sorry, guys, but the store
closed five minutes ago.

17:53.363 --> 17:54.989
But I haven't decided yet.

17:55.157 --> 17:57.617
You'll have to come back tomorrow.
The registers are closed.

18:02.331 --> 18:05.416
Let's get you some food.
You'll feel better after you eat.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.335
Okay.

18:07.503 --> 18:11.339
What do you want like, Thai food?
A burger?

18:11.507 --> 18:13.466
I don't know!

18:24.353 --> 18:26.187
Hey, look, a quarter!

18:35.823 --> 18:36.864
How's that feel?

18:37.032 --> 18:39.283
Great.
Not like regret at all.

18:42.704 --> 18:44.038
Penny?

18:44.873 --> 18:45.873
We're working together!

18:47.501 --> 18:48.501
Awesome!
