WEBVTT

00:03.628 --> 00:05.921
Should you really be
sitting in Sheldon's spot?

00:06.089 --> 00:07.881
He's in Texas.
He'll never know.

00:08.049 --> 00:09.370
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

00:09.467 --> 00:11.343
Yeah, he has a very sensitive butt.

00:14.264 --> 00:15.264
Well, it's true.

00:15.432 --> 00:18.058
Once I saw him sit on a bunch
of loose change and add it up.

00:20.603 --> 00:21.684
Have you heard from Howard?

00:21.771 --> 00:23.272
I did.
His talk at NASA went great.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.648
Sheldon didn't heckle him?

00:24.816 --> 00:26.256
No, in fact, he was so well-behaved,

00:26.401 --> 00:29.445
Howie bought him a Buzz Aldrin
bobble head and astronaut ice cream.

00:31.614 --> 00:33.449
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Stewart.

00:33.616 --> 00:34.950
- How's it going?
- Good.

00:35.118 --> 00:37.786
Sheldon's out of town,
so we can do whatever we want.

00:37.954 --> 00:39.994
We even ordered from
the Thai place he doesn't like.

00:39.998 --> 00:40.998
How is it?

00:41.166 --> 00:42.708
Disgusting. Do not tell him.

00:44.294 --> 00:45.461
What do you guys want to do tonight?

00:45.628 --> 00:46.795
I don't know.

00:46.963 --> 00:49.590
I told Howie if I wasn't busy,
I'd spend the night at his mom's.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.633
So for God's sake,
think of something.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.014
Stuart? Are you okay?

00:57.182 --> 00:58.807
No, I don't feel so...

01:00.018 --> 01:01.185
- Oh, Stuart?
- Stuart?

01:01.352 --> 01:03.145
Oh, my God,
you guys need to do something!

01:03.313 --> 01:04.646
Calling 911.

01:04.814 --> 01:07.483
- It's too late.
- What do you mean it's too late?

01:07.650 --> 01:10.486
He's been murdered
by someone in this room.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.156
- Oh, my God.
- Come on!

01:14.657 --> 01:18.160
Welcome to another classic
Koothrappali murder mystery dinner.

01:19.829 --> 01:21.163
I'm leaving.

01:21.956 --> 01:22.956
You can't leave.

01:23.124 --> 01:27.002
You're a suspect in the
mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom.

01:30.256 --> 01:31.507
I didn't know his
last name was Bloom.

01:31.674 --> 01:32.800
Yeah, it's Bloom.

01:34.010 --> 01:35.177
Are you really gonna
lie on the floor

01:35.345 --> 01:36.666
and pretend to be dead all night?

01:36.679 --> 01:38.472
What do you think
I was gonna do at home?

02:06.126 --> 02:08.168
Are you gonna make us pretend
to be a bunch of lame characters

02:08.336 --> 02:09.837
with silly accents?

02:10.463 --> 02:14.091
"Lame characters with silly ac..."
What kind of actress are you?

02:17.887 --> 02:20.222
You're right, I'm sorry.
It sounds like fun.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.683
- Thank you.
- That kind of actress. This sucks!

02:25.061 --> 02:27.062
Come on, guys.
Raj put a lot of effort into this.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.898
And that's great.
It's not sad, it's great.

02:31.359 --> 02:33.152
I think it might be fun
to be someone else tonight.

02:33.319 --> 02:34.903
Actually, you're all just
gonna be yourselves.

02:35.071 --> 02:36.655
Oh. Ecch!

02:38.575 --> 02:41.336
All right, if I'm doing this, I'm
playing to win. So just to be clear,

02:41.452 --> 02:43.662
If we're ourselves,
that means one of us killed Stuart?

02:43.830 --> 02:47.666
Very good, Bernadette.
You are a regular Byomkesh Bakshi.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.627
What is that, like,
the Indian Sherlock Holmes?

02:50.795 --> 02:53.964
Or is Sherlock Holmes
the English Byomkesh Bakshi?

02:55.592 --> 02:57.885
According to Wikipedia,
Sherlock Holmes came first.

02:58.052 --> 02:59.970
Great, everyone's a Byomkesh Bakshi.

03:01.097 --> 03:06.476
Now, here are some secret facts
about each of you,

03:06.644 --> 03:09.563
including whether
you are the murderer.

03:09.731 --> 03:11.023
Throughout the game, feel free

03:11.191 --> 03:13.233
to ask each other questions
to uncover clues.

03:13.401 --> 03:14.401
Got it.

03:14.569 --> 03:16.236
Hey, who's the murderer?

03:19.073 --> 03:21.241
Any question but that.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.076
Sorry.

03:23.244 --> 03:24.912
Hey, who's not the murderer?

03:27.957 --> 03:30.542
Bernadette, can you not stand
so close to me?

03:30.710 --> 03:31.960
What do you care? You're dead.

03:32.128 --> 03:35.464
Suit yourself.
But I can kind of see up your skirt.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.225
Thank you for my bobble head.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.436
Thank you for not making fun
of me during my speech.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.730
It wasn't easy. Was it Buzz?

03:55.610 --> 03:58.111
We can't show up to
your mom's empty-handed.

03:58.279 --> 03:59.696
We should bring something.

03:59.864 --> 04:02.658
I already am.
I'm bringing the gift of knowledge.

04:02.825 --> 04:04.326
Oh, boy.

04:05.161 --> 04:08.830
Despite what her Bible says,
recent archeological studies indicate

04:08.998 --> 04:11.708
that although camels are
referenced in the Old Testament,

04:11.876 --> 04:15.170
they didn't exist in the Middle East
until hundreds of years later.

04:16.005 --> 04:18.757
I was gonna say we pick up
a cake or a pie.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.176
But an insult to her faith
is always thoughtful.

04:25.473 --> 04:27.099
So, what happens next?

04:27.267 --> 04:29.351
I can't tell you that.
But perhaps the killer dropped

04:29.519 --> 04:32.354
a fun and imaginative clue
somewhere in the apartment.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.064
Ooh, I'm gonna check the fridge,

04:34.232 --> 04:36.191
and see if there are
any clues inside a beer.

04:37.610 --> 04:38.902
Hey, I found something.

04:39.070 --> 04:41.363
It looks like a little man
with a briefcase.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.365
Oh, no. That's Clarence Darrow.

04:43.533 --> 04:46.368
It's from a game Sheldon made up
called Chutes and Lawyers.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.747
You slide down a chute
and then work your way back up

04:50.915 --> 04:52.624
through the appellate system.

04:54.377 --> 04:57.671
Well, unlike that,
my games are much more fun.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.399
Can I ask you something? Why do you
like making us do this stuff?

05:01.217 --> 05:02.509
Well, I guess it goes back to

05:02.677 --> 05:04.997
when I was a fat kid in India,
and didn't have any friends.

05:05.054 --> 05:06.388
I didn't know you were fat.

05:06.556 --> 05:10.809
Yeah, I was 200 pounds
by the time I was in middle school.

05:10.977 --> 05:13.395
Kids were mean.
Cows may be sacred there,

05:13.563 --> 05:15.564
but it doesn't help
if you look like one.

05:16.899 --> 05:18.275
Anyway, I was pretty lonely,

05:18.443 --> 05:20.527
so I had to make up
my own stories and games,

05:20.695 --> 05:22.821
and I promised myself
if I ever made any friends

05:22.989 --> 05:25.782
that I would play
those games with them.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.868
That is so sweet.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.203
I've seen old pictures of you.

05:30.371 --> 05:31.621
You were never a fat kid.

05:31.789 --> 05:33.707
No, I was svelte as a gazelle.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.503
A gazelle blessed with a flair
for storytelling.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.718
Hey, what about this?
It looks like a receipt.

05:44.886 --> 05:46.511
- What's it for?
- For a cup of coffee.

05:46.679 --> 05:48.513
But it's dated 20 years from now.

05:48.681 --> 05:52.392
From the future?
How fun and imaginative.

05:54.270 --> 05:57.230
So one of us came back from
the future to murder Stuart?

05:57.398 --> 05:58.398
Correct.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.442
Does the gazelle with a flair
for storytelling

06:00.610 --> 06:02.277
know he's ripping off Terminator?

06:02.445 --> 06:05.447
Does the smart-ass know
that Terminator was actually

06:05.615 --> 06:07.115
ripped off from an Outer Limits
script called

06:07.283 --> 06:09.117
Demon With a Glass Hand,
by Harlan Ellison?

06:09.285 --> 06:12.204
Oh, does the gazelle know that
according to Harlan Ellison,

06:12.372 --> 06:14.748
it was not ripped off
from Demon With a Glass Hand,

06:14.916 --> 06:17.209
but was ripped off from another
Outer Limits script

06:17.377 --> 06:18.877
he wrote called The Soldier?

06:19.045 --> 06:20.796
I'm gonna need another clue.

06:25.593 --> 06:28.678
Okay, give me the flowers and pie.

06:28.846 --> 06:30.486
But if we show up
and you're holding them,

06:30.598 --> 06:32.099
she'll think they're only from you.

06:32.266 --> 06:33.475
They are only from me.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.019
You said the gift of you was enough.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.482
Yes, but now that I've seen
what the gift of me

06:40.650 --> 06:43.485
with flowers and pie looks like,
there's no going back.

06:45.530 --> 06:48.365
Boy, I can't wait to see
the look on her face...

06:49.325 --> 06:50.450
We're leaving right now.

06:50.618 --> 06:51.827
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

06:51.994 --> 06:53.495
Sheldon, tell me what's going on!

06:53.663 --> 06:55.038
I saw my mommy with a naked man

06:55.206 --> 06:57.040
and she was trying
to be a mommy again.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.426
You ready to talk about it?

07:07.593 --> 07:09.511
I'm not nearly drunk enough.

07:12.181 --> 07:13.515
Okay.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.910
Do you have any idea
what it's like to see

07:18.980 --> 07:20.814
your mother ravaging someone?

07:22.066 --> 07:23.608
Does a brisket count?

07:27.280 --> 07:29.531
I'm sorry, buddy, that's rough.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.099
But didn't she know we were coming?

07:31.200 --> 07:33.910
No. I wanted to surprise her.

07:34.078 --> 07:37.038
What am I supposed to say to
her after something like this?

07:37.206 --> 07:39.082
Well, did she see you
in the window?

07:39.250 --> 07:40.834
- No.
- Then don't say anything.

07:42.253 --> 07:43.920
I have to.

07:44.088 --> 07:46.131
How can we ever hope to have
a healthy relationship

07:46.299 --> 07:47.966
if I don't tell her
how disappointed I am,

07:48.134 --> 07:49.676
and that I'll never forgive her?

07:51.554 --> 07:53.472
Well, don't do it on the phone.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.098
I'm just going
to tell her I'm coming

07:55.266 --> 07:57.851
so she can give that
"Good Time Charlie" the heave-ho.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.813
That's some tough talk.
I may need to cut you off.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.400
Yeah, maybe you better.
I took a pretty big sip.

08:09.071 --> 08:11.698
Look, she's a grown woman.

08:11.866 --> 08:15.744
And... and your dad's been
gone a long time.

08:15.912 --> 08:18.079
Maybe this is none of your business.

08:19.415 --> 08:20.999
I beg to differ.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.834
I used to live in those genitals.

08:24.295 --> 08:25.879
And if someone wants
to move into my old room,

08:26.047 --> 08:27.714
I should at least get a vote.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.513
Okay, murder suspects,

08:34.680 --> 08:37.557
Leonard has found the time
machine the killer must've used.

08:37.725 --> 08:41.603
You're all inside it, and we hurtle
through the very fabric of time.

08:49.529 --> 08:52.697
And welcome
to 20 years in the future.

08:55.451 --> 08:57.786
Hey, you guys just time-traveled.
Stop looking so bored.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.331
Well, my beer isn't flat
and my rack's not saggy.

09:01.499 --> 09:03.542
So far, the future's great.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.754
Hey, can I go to the bathroom?

09:07.922 --> 09:09.881
Fine, just try not to look too alive.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.049
That's my jam.

09:15.179 --> 09:17.138
So one of us went back
in time to kill Stuart?

09:17.306 --> 09:20.100
- But why?
- Perhaps this will help.

09:20.268 --> 09:24.521
Here are some facts
about yourselves in the future

09:24.689 --> 09:27.148
that might contain a clue.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.652
Hey, I won
the Nobel Prize in physiology.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.446
Then I used the money to buy
Stuart's comic book store,

09:33.614 --> 09:36.241
and close it down so Sheldon
would pay attention to me.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.663
Not the worst idea.

09:43.457 --> 09:45.875
Hey, I'm a famous actress
living in London.

09:46.043 --> 09:47.794
I'm a professor at Stanford.

09:47.962 --> 09:50.046
So I guess you two are
making it work long distance.

09:50.214 --> 09:52.966
Oh, no. In this game,
as your careers both took off,

09:53.134 --> 09:55.760
you drifted apart.
Kind of like how future me

09:55.928 --> 09:57.769
lost touch with you guys
after I became boy toy

09:57.847 --> 10:00.473
for the wrinkled,
but still flexible, Madonna.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.460
What does your card say, Bernadette?

10:05.605 --> 10:08.148
Hang on. Do you think
we'd really drift apart

10:08.316 --> 10:09.899
if we both became successful?

10:10.067 --> 10:11.359
Of course not.

10:11.527 --> 10:13.069
If I became a famous actress
and had to move,

10:13.237 --> 10:14.779
you would just come with me.

10:16.324 --> 10:18.204
But if I get a chance
to be a tenured professor,

10:18.242 --> 10:20.702
I might not have that much
choice in where I end up.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.579
Yeah, but if I become
a successful actress,

10:22.747 --> 10:24.247
we wouldn't need the money.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.591
Well, you don't go
into science for the money.

10:26.709 --> 10:27.959
Speak for yourself.

10:28.127 --> 10:32.213
Last month, my company both invented
and cured Restless Eye Syndrome.

10:35.384 --> 10:37.385
Ka-ching, ya blinky chumps.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.982
So, wait, if my career
took me somewhere else,

10:42.099 --> 10:43.183
you might not go?

10:48.272 --> 10:49.731
He started it.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.692
Okay, guys, new back stories.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.195
Penny and Leonard, you two lovebirds

10:55.363 --> 10:58.239
are super successful
and living in New York.

10:58.407 --> 11:01.743
You're an actress, you're a professor
and you have three beautiful kids.

11:01.911 --> 11:02.911
- Great.
- Really?

11:03.079 --> 11:05.079
You think I'm putting
this body through three kids?

11:08.376 --> 11:09.918
Okay, let's do this.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.086
Good luck.

11:11.253 --> 11:13.546
You...
Aren't you gonna come with me?

11:13.714 --> 11:15.882
While you confront your mother
about her sex life?

11:16.050 --> 11:19.386
I'd rather go back to that bar
in ass-less chaps.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.894
Mother?
Mother?

11:28.604 --> 11:29.938
Mother.

11:30.439 --> 11:32.857
Shelly!
I'm so glad you're here!

11:33.025 --> 11:34.776
I saw you having naked sex.

11:37.738 --> 11:39.197
What are you talking about?

11:39.365 --> 11:41.533
Earlier, I came here to surprise you.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.411
I looked in the window
and I saw you with a man.

11:44.578 --> 11:48.873
Oh, Shelly, I'm so sorry.
Come in.

11:52.002 --> 11:53.002
Um...

11:54.171 --> 11:56.881
Maybe we should sit down
and talk about this.

11:58.134 --> 12:00.760
Can you recommend a surface
you haven't had coitus on?

12:04.640 --> 12:06.224
That's not funny.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.312
Maybe we should sit at the table.

12:18.821 --> 12:24.367
Well, I'm sure that you
have a lot of questions.

12:25.661 --> 12:26.828
Who was he?

12:26.996 --> 12:30.248
His name is Ron.
I met him at my prayer group.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.226
How long have you been
involved with him?

12:33.294 --> 12:34.836
A few months.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.629
And of those few months,

12:36.797 --> 12:39.758
how long have you been
a demented sex pervert?

12:43.345 --> 12:45.430
That is no way
to speak to your mother.

12:45.681 --> 12:47.015
Perhaps not.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.517
But it is a way to speak
to a woman who quoted the Bible

12:49.685 --> 12:51.686
to me my whole life,
and then desecrates

12:51.854 --> 12:53.688
one of Ethan Allen's finest sofas.

12:55.149 --> 12:58.485
I will give you one opportunity,
young man, to apologize.

12:59.695 --> 13:01.613
- Or what?
- Or I will send you to your room.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.533
That's ridiculous.
I am a grown man.

13:05.701 --> 13:07.535
I am a professional scientist.

13:07.703 --> 13:09.829
And I currently occupy
the moral high ground.

13:09.997 --> 13:11.539
Go to your room.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.543
But I occupy the moral high ground.

13:16.420 --> 13:17.629
Go to your room.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.507
But I'm a professional scientist.

13:20.674 --> 13:23.426
Go to your room!

13:28.140 --> 13:30.016
I'm a grown man.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.604
Can we please get back to the game?

13:34.772 --> 13:37.232
In a minute.
I don't understand why any success

13:37.399 --> 13:40.902
you have in acting is more important
than any I have in science.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.862
Okay, if you do
something cool in science,

13:43.030 --> 13:44.239
you might change the world.

13:44.406 --> 13:47.867
If I become a famous actress...

13:48.035 --> 13:50.676
I'm not gonna tell you why movie
stars are the best. They just are.

13:52.581 --> 13:54.874
I'm surprised you guys never
talked about this stuff.

13:55.042 --> 13:57.085
Like you and Sheldon have
everything figured out?

13:57.253 --> 14:00.630
Actually, our relationship agreement
covers a wide array of scenarios,

14:00.798 --> 14:03.466
including career changes,
financial instability,

14:03.634 --> 14:05.593
intelligent dog uprising.

14:07.263 --> 14:10.431
FYI, we plan on selling out
the human race hard.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.521
In 20 years, who knows
what'll happen with any of us?

14:16.689 --> 14:19.148
I think you and Leonard
will be together.

14:19.316 --> 14:20.775
- You do?
- Yeah.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.694
I think you're
the best couple I know.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.028
That's so sweet.

14:24.196 --> 14:25.572
- What the hell?
- Excuse me?

14:27.283 --> 14:29.450
Duh, duh, duh...
Let the dead man talk.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.120
So, why do you think that?

14:32.288 --> 14:36.875
Well, I feel like you guys
make each other better.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.252
Penny brought Leonard
out of his shell.

14:39.420 --> 14:42.046
And it seems like Leonard makes Penny
think more deeply about the world.

14:42.214 --> 14:46.593
I don't know. Together, you two
kind of make one awesome person.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.304
Aw, Stuart.

14:49.471 --> 14:51.055
Now I feel bad for murdering you.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.224
Oh, come on!

14:54.310 --> 14:57.437
Penny did it! I win!
Suck it, jackasses!

15:05.154 --> 15:06.654
Hey, can I come in?

15:07.156 --> 15:08.876
Apparently any man
is welcome in this house.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.575
Why not you?

15:12.536 --> 15:14.329
I thought you were waiting
in the car.

15:14.496 --> 15:15.955
That was an hour ago, Sheldon.

15:16.123 --> 15:18.333
A Jew sits in front of a house
in Texas that long,

15:18.500 --> 15:20.168
"For Sale" signs start to go up.

15:23.714 --> 15:27.008
I take it things didn't
go smoothly with your mom.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.052
No.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.679
I'm not sure how we're going
to get past this.

15:32.514 --> 15:38.478
You know, I sort of went
through something like this myself.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.855
Howard, we've all seen
your mother naked.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.360
That woman needs to learn
how to tie a robe.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.238
I'm talking about when
my mom started seeing someone

15:49.406 --> 15:51.491
a couple years after my dad left.

15:52.868 --> 15:53.993
I didn't know she did.

15:54.161 --> 15:57.830
Yeah, she was dating this guy,

15:57.998 --> 16:01.584
and I was kind of a jerk
to her about it.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.337
What did you do?

16:04.880 --> 16:06.381
Let's just say
it was the most vicious

16:06.548 --> 16:08.675
bar mitzvah speech in
the history of Temple Beth El.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.304
Anyway, she broke up with him.

16:13.889 --> 16:17.642
And she's basically
been alone ever since.

16:19.436 --> 16:24.023
She never said it, but I always felt
I was the reason why.

16:25.567 --> 16:26.985
I'm sorry.

16:27.152 --> 16:28.736
Although, based on your story,

16:28.904 --> 16:30.780
you absolutely were the reason why.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.118
All I'm saying is
you might not want

16:35.285 --> 16:38.329
to get in the way
of your mom's happiness.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.499
You may have a point.

16:42.918 --> 16:44.293
I love my mother.

16:45.587 --> 16:47.922
Even if she fornicates
like a demonic weasel.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.304
And the healing begins.

17:01.145 --> 17:02.520
- Hello.
- Hello.

17:02.688 --> 17:05.523
Are you ready to discuss
this calmly, like adults?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.401
I am.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.750
Shelly, I'm sorry that
you saw what you saw.

17:23.917 --> 17:26.127
I know that this is hard for you.

17:26.879 --> 17:30.298
I think what most upsets me
about it, Mother, is the hypocrisy.

17:30.924 --> 17:32.216
Doesn't this contradict

17:32.384 --> 17:34.824
all the religious rules you've
been espousing your whole life?

17:34.970 --> 17:36.721
You're right, it does,
and it's something

17:36.889 --> 17:38.973
that I'm struggling
with these days.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.641
Then why are you doing it?

17:40.809 --> 17:43.644
Because I'm not perfect, Shelly.

17:43.812 --> 17:46.522
And that man's booty is.

17:52.196 --> 17:53.988
Well, this is confusing for me.

17:56.158 --> 17:58.319
But I don't want to stand
in the way of your happiness.

17:58.535 --> 17:59.535
So...

18:00.287 --> 18:02.789
I'll condemn you internally
while maintaining

18:02.956 --> 18:04.665
an outward appearance of acceptance.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.420
That is very Christian of you.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.343
Mother, if you're going
to conduct your life in this fashion,

18:15.511 --> 18:18.346
then I should let you know
that the world has changed

18:18.514 --> 18:20.056
since you were a young woman.

18:20.349 --> 18:24.185
You know, it's not all sock hops,
soda jerks and segregation anymore.

18:25.979 --> 18:27.772
How old do you think I am?

18:29.358 --> 18:32.443
My point is that you're going
to need to be careful.

18:32.945 --> 18:37.115
You used to be protected by your
pre-Enlightenment mythology,

18:37.282 --> 18:39.700
but now you're going
to need a stronger friend

18:39.868 --> 18:41.327
named latex.

18:44.039 --> 18:46.624
Are you having the sex talk with me?

18:47.459 --> 18:48.835
Well, someone has to.

18:49.002 --> 18:51.003
Oh, dear Lord!

18:51.171 --> 18:53.798
No, don't look to Him.
He's mad at you right now.

19:00.472 --> 19:03.349
Come on, don't pout.
I'm sorry I ruined your game.

19:03.517 --> 19:05.393
I'm not pouting, I'm brooding.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.854
Which is how sexy men pout.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.024
It actually was kind of fun.

19:12.192 --> 19:13.609
You're just saying that.

19:14.611 --> 19:16.070
Yeah.

19:18.532 --> 19:19.949
I liked the time travel element.

19:20.117 --> 19:21.659
Thank you.
I thought it was inspired.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.661
It was. By Terminator.

19:25.247 --> 19:27.767
Well, I hope 20 years from now,
we really are all still together

19:27.791 --> 19:28.916
and still friends.

19:29.084 --> 19:30.251
- Definitely.
- Of course.

19:30.419 --> 19:31.711
Hey, how about this?

19:31.879 --> 19:33.880
Whether we're friends, not friends,

19:34.047 --> 19:35.923
scattered around the world,
no matter what,

19:36.091 --> 19:37.842
let's all promise to meet
in front of this building

19:38.010 --> 19:40.219
exactly 20 years
from tonight at 8:00 p.m.

19:40.387 --> 19:41.929
and have dinner
like we always do.

19:42.097 --> 19:43.681
Aw, I love it.

19:44.308 --> 19:45.433
Putting it in my phone right now.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.059
Yeah, me, too.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.979
My phone doesn't have a calendar.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.444
It's all right,
I'll just write it on my hand.

19:59.364 --> 20:00.781
And it's done.

20:00.949 --> 20:02.116
Yup, we're all in.

20:02.284 --> 20:04.744
All right,
I'll see you guys in 20 years.

20:12.502 --> 20:13.920
I knew it.
