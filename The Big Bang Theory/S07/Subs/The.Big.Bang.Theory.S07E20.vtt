WEBVTT

00:03.336 --> 00:05.587
I got to tell you, the more
I read about the primordial

00:05.755 --> 00:08.507
gravity wave discovery,
the more excited I get.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.467
I know. Being an
astrophysicist right now

00:10.635 --> 00:11.760
is like being a rock star.

00:11.928 --> 00:13.554
Only without the sex.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.932
Yeah, literally, none of it.

00:18.601 --> 00:20.041
What do you think about it, Sheldon?

00:20.145 --> 00:21.645
Meh.

00:21.813 --> 00:23.647
Are you kidding me?

00:23.815 --> 00:25.858
This may be the biggest
scientific breakthrough

00:26.026 --> 00:27.109
of our lifetime.

00:27.277 --> 00:30.612
How can you, as a theoretical
physicist, not care about this?

00:30.780 --> 00:32.740
Maybe it's because
I'm not an elitist.

00:32.907 --> 00:34.116
What I'd like to know is:

00:34.284 --> 00:36.160
How does this gravity wave
breakthrough

00:36.327 --> 00:37.953
help the man on the street?
You know?

00:38.121 --> 00:39.872
Who's looking out
for Joe Six-Pack

00:40.040 --> 00:42.416
and all his quantum physics concerns?

00:42.584 --> 00:45.210
Oh, my God, you're jealous.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.296
Why would I be jealous?

00:47.464 --> 00:49.757
I don't know. Maybe because
the origin of the universe

00:49.924 --> 00:52.593
just got proven,
the Higgs field just got proven

00:52.761 --> 00:55.387
and you've been working on
string theory for the last 20 years

00:55.555 --> 00:58.015
and you're no closer to proving
it than when you started.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.934
Yeah, well, I've had a lot
on my plate.

01:02.103 --> 01:04.772
We happen to live in
a golden age of television.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.400
- Excuse me, fellas.

01:08.568 --> 01:10.409
Sorry for eavesdropping,
but there actually was

01:10.487 --> 01:13.530
some big string theory news today
out of the Hadron Collider.

01:13.698 --> 01:15.991
Really?
Did they find evidence to support

01:16.159 --> 01:17.910
extra dimensions
or supersymmetry?

01:18.078 --> 01:21.914
No, but they did find evidence
that you'll believe anything.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.167
Why would you do that?

01:25.335 --> 01:27.294
You're a string theorist as well.

01:27.462 --> 01:30.214
Incorrect.
I am a string pragmatist.

01:30.381 --> 01:32.716
I say I'm gonna prove something
that cannot be proved,

01:32.884 --> 01:34.176
I apply for grant money,

01:34.344 --> 01:36.553
and then I spend it
on liquor and broads.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.556
Later.

01:41.518 --> 01:43.727
Do you think he's right?

01:43.853 --> 01:48.023
Am I wasting my life on a theory
that can never be proven?

01:50.860 --> 01:54.530
Maybe. But how great
is Game of Thrones?

02:21.057 --> 02:22.891
Hey, you're up early.

02:23.059 --> 02:25.102
I couldn't sleep.

02:25.270 --> 02:29.189
I told you those Walking Dead
pillowcases were a bad idea.

02:29.315 --> 02:31.233
No, that's not it.

02:31.401 --> 02:32.901
Is something bothering you?

02:33.069 --> 02:35.863
Yes, but you wouldn't understand.

02:36.030 --> 02:38.157
Come on, try me.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.118
All right.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.747
I've devoted the prime
of my life to string theory

02:45.915 --> 02:49.751
and its quest for the
compactification of extra dimensions.

02:49.919 --> 02:53.088
I've got nothing to show for it,
and I feel like a fool.

02:54.132 --> 02:56.008
OK. I get it.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.343
I mean, not all the jibber-jabber
in the middle, but...

03:00.221 --> 03:02.264
...I know what it's like to put your
heart and soul into something

03:02.432 --> 03:03.932
and get nothing out of it.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.101
You mean your acting career?

03:08.229 --> 03:10.939
- No.
- Your relationship with Leonard?

03:12.442 --> 03:13.483
No.

03:13.651 --> 03:15.068
Your failed attempt
to go back to college?

03:15.236 --> 03:16.695
No!

03:17.447 --> 03:20.032
I'm saying you and string theory
sound like a relationship,

03:20.200 --> 03:21.325
and I know what it's like
to be in one

03:21.492 --> 03:23.785
and realize it's never gonna
turn out the way you want.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.955
I said Leonard, you said no.

03:28.082 --> 03:30.042
I'm talking about other guys.

03:30.210 --> 03:34.087
OK. Well, what do you do?

03:34.255 --> 03:36.715
You have to have the courage
to end the relationship.

03:36.883 --> 03:39.718
You know? Break it off,
shake hands, walk away.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.722
I don't know if I can do that.

03:43.890 --> 03:46.308
I know it's hard, honey,
but in the end, that's how you grow.

03:51.147 --> 03:53.357
Penny, have you seen
my good inhaler?

03:56.361 --> 03:58.612
Break it off,
shake hands, walk away.

04:03.576 --> 04:06.370
Hey, how's dating two women going?

04:06.537 --> 04:08.664
Um, kind of hit a bump.

04:08.831 --> 04:10.624
When I was honest and told Emily

04:10.792 --> 04:13.043
she wasn't the only person
I was seeing, it went great.

04:13.211 --> 04:14.836
So I tried the same thing with Lucy.

04:15.004 --> 04:19.216
- And?
- She had mixed feelings.

04:19.342 --> 04:21.677
But when I said,
"Emily was cool with it.

04:21.844 --> 04:24.005
Emily's the best. Why can't you
be more like Emily?"...

04:26.057 --> 04:29.101
...those feelings
became less mixed.

04:31.562 --> 04:34.189
Women. Who knows what'll set 'em off?

04:35.275 --> 04:38.110
At least now I can focus all
my energies on just one girl.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.112
I hope I get to meet her
as soon as possible.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.905
Why the rush?
She isn't going anywhere.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.366
She is. But I like that attitude.

04:46.369 --> 04:50.080
Gentlemen, is anybody interested
in my old string theory books?

04:50.248 --> 04:51.873
You're really going to do this?

04:52.041 --> 04:54.084
I am. Yeah, Penny pointed out

04:54.252 --> 04:56.962
that what I'm going through
is essentially a breakup.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.881
And according
to Cosmopolitan magazine,

05:00.049 --> 05:02.217
one of the most effective
techniques for moving on

05:02.385 --> 05:04.970
is to get rid of all reminders
of the relationship.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.431
- You're reading Cosmo?
- Yes.

05:07.598 --> 05:09.474
As it turns out, there's an article

05:09.642 --> 05:12.519
on how to get over a breakup
in literally every issue.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.898
Anyway, it suggests
that I set these on fire,

05:17.066 --> 05:19.109
but the smell of burning books

05:19.277 --> 05:22.112
reminds me of church picnics
in East Texas.

05:24.073 --> 05:25.657
What's this?

05:25.825 --> 05:29.494
That's just a doodle of
a hyperelliptic Riemann surface.

05:29.662 --> 05:32.581
Oh, yeah. Wasn't that the basis
of your postdoc fellowship?

05:32.749 --> 05:34.082
It was.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.710
This seemed so elegant
at the time,

05:36.878 --> 05:40.047
but now I realize I was just
a simple country boy,

05:40.214 --> 05:42.716
seduced by a big city theory

05:42.884 --> 05:45.218
with variables
in all the right places.

05:47.096 --> 05:49.139
- It's going to be OK.
- I know.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.350
As hard as this is,
I have to move on.

05:51.517 --> 05:54.227
I can't keep postulating
multidimensional entities

05:54.395 --> 05:56.063
and get nothing in return.

05:56.230 --> 05:59.024
I have needs, too.

06:04.030 --> 06:07.157
So, you and Emily
still together?

06:12.997 --> 06:15.207
I spoke to Bernadette.
She's free tomorrow night.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.458
OK, great.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.960
But if we're really gonna do
a double date,

06:19.128 --> 06:21.296
then we have to go over
some ground rules about Emily.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.548
Like when it turns out
she's made of rubber,

06:23.716 --> 06:25.050
I don't say anything?

06:27.053 --> 06:28.553
She's very real.

06:28.721 --> 06:30.847
That's what it says on the box.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.060
Right next to "dishwasher safe."

06:36.396 --> 06:38.355
See? This is exactly
the kind of thing

06:38.523 --> 06:40.315
I'm worried about you
saying in front of her.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.442
I promise I'll be
on my best behavior.

06:42.610 --> 06:46.154
You better be. No jokes about
how close I am with my dog.

06:46.322 --> 06:49.783
Or the truth about how close
I am with my dog.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.326
You got it.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.161
No jokes about
the year I took ballet.

06:53.329 --> 06:54.913
You took ballet?

06:56.165 --> 06:57.916
God, you never listen.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.879
Are you sure you
want to do this?

07:03.047 --> 07:05.507
The magazine articles suggest
that one of the ways

07:05.675 --> 07:07.968
to get over a breakup
is a new look.

07:08.136 --> 07:12.055
What about your old look,
well-groomed ventriloquist doll?

07:14.350 --> 07:16.977
- "Oh, my God, I do look like that."
- Stop it!

07:19.647 --> 07:21.648
So, how do you want me
to cut it?

07:21.816 --> 07:25.944
How about Bill Gates
meets Nikola Tesla?

07:27.238 --> 07:30.031
So, business in the front,
science in the back.

07:30.199 --> 07:33.577
Or I don't cut it and
maybe just style it a little.

07:33.744 --> 07:35.120
I'm in your hands.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.623
Do a good job and I'll tell you
Cosmo's ten dynamite tips

07:38.791 --> 07:40.709
to enjoy your PMS.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.086
Can you keep him quiet?

07:43.254 --> 07:44.546
Maybe jangle some keys
in front of him?

07:44.714 --> 07:45.922
That doesn't work anymore.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.341
He just thinks I'm taking him
to the doctor.

07:50.052 --> 07:52.721
So, now that you're
no longer invested in string theory,

07:52.889 --> 07:54.306
what are you gonna pursue?

07:54.474 --> 07:56.391
There are so
many exciting areas:

07:56.559 --> 07:59.186
black holes, dark matter...

07:59.353 --> 08:01.021
Leonard was telling me
about dark matter,

08:01.189 --> 08:02.550
but I didn't really understand it.

08:02.565 --> 08:05.192
Don't feel bad.
Neither does he.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.072
OK...

08:11.616 --> 08:13.492
...what do you think?

08:15.328 --> 08:17.746
Have you ever even seen
a picture of Tesla?

08:19.123 --> 08:20.582
It actually looks good, Sheldon.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.626
- Doesn't it?
- Yeah.

08:22.752 --> 08:26.755
I suppose I could see myself
in a scientific boy band.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.217
Of course, I'd be the dreamy one
and the smart one.

08:32.094 --> 08:33.470
Sorry I'm late.

08:34.680 --> 08:37.474
- What did you do?
- I gave him a new look.

08:37.642 --> 08:41.269
- It's cute, huh?
- Yeah, it's cute. That's the problem.

08:41.437 --> 08:43.605
I don't need other girls
to see him walking around

08:43.773 --> 08:45.398
like sex on a stick.

08:47.985 --> 08:50.028
She's right. I'm too hot.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.618
I'm excited to meet Emily.

08:56.786 --> 08:59.621
Me, too. I just hope
he doesn't blow it.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.122
Why would you say that?

09:01.290 --> 09:05.085
Because he's Raj.
That's his thing.

09:05.211 --> 09:08.255
Beckham can bend it,
Ralph can wreck it, Raj can blow it.

09:09.799 --> 09:11.633
Look, I don't want it to happen,

09:11.801 --> 09:14.177
but odds are he's gonna
find a way to...

09:15.304 --> 09:17.138
Oh, crap, I know that girl.

09:17.306 --> 09:20.642
- How?
- In a bad way, very bad.

09:20.810 --> 09:21.935
Hey, guys.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.603
Whatever you hear tonight,
just remember I love you.

09:23.771 --> 09:24.896
Hey!

09:29.777 --> 09:32.654
Emily, these are my good
friends, Howard and Bernadette.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.781
- Guys, this is Emily.
- Nice to meet you.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.157
- Hi.
- Hello.

09:36.325 --> 09:37.951
Have we met before?

09:39.996 --> 09:41.496
No.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.666
I don't...
I don't... think so.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.293
You sure? You look familiar.

09:46.460 --> 09:48.670
Well, you sure don't.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.381
You I know, you I know, you?

09:51.549 --> 09:53.550
Total stranger.

09:53.718 --> 09:57.762
Even if you had yummy candy,
I would not get in your van.

09:58.806 --> 10:00.724
Did you go to that spin class
on Green Street?

10:00.891 --> 10:02.601
That must be it.

10:02.768 --> 10:05.020
Since when do you go to spin class?

10:05.354 --> 10:07.272
Wow. Now who doesn't listen?

10:09.984 --> 10:12.611
Sheldon, your food's getting cold.
What are you doing?

10:12.778 --> 10:16.781
Looking through my textbooks
for a new field of inquiry.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.784
Why do we have a geology book?

10:19.952 --> 10:23.079
Leonard, did you throw
a children's party

10:23.247 --> 10:24.623
while I was in Texas?

10:25.916 --> 10:27.500
Wait. What's wrong with geology?

10:27.668 --> 10:30.211
Let me put this in a way
you'll understand, Penny.

10:30.379 --> 10:32.088
You remember
how you explained to me

10:32.256 --> 10:34.299
that the Kardashians
aren't real celebrities?

10:34.467 --> 10:38.219
Well, geology
is the Kardashians of science.

10:40.681 --> 10:43.224
Have you considered
studying standard model physics?

10:43.392 --> 10:45.226
You want me
to give up string theory

10:45.394 --> 10:47.312
for something
that's less advanced?

10:47.480 --> 10:48.688
You know, why don't you break up
with Penny

10:48.856 --> 10:50.982
and start dating a brown bear.

10:52.568 --> 10:55.487
Like you could get a brown bear.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.197
Hey, I've got a good job.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.199
I could buy salmon.
You don't know.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.577
Maybe you could make
your new field of study

11:02.745 --> 11:04.425
the calculation
of nuclear matrix elements.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.622
Oh, please.

11:05.790 --> 11:09.042
If I wanted to take up a fad,
I'd get a tramp stamp.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.756
What about loop quantum gravity?

11:14.924 --> 11:16.716
Oh, Duchess, look at me!

11:16.884 --> 11:19.803
My quantum gravity's
positively loopy!

11:21.389 --> 11:22.972
Who's the duchess?

11:23.140 --> 11:24.933
One of the people
that lives in his head.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.062
I hope he's this distraught
if he ever breaks up with me.

11:29.230 --> 11:31.856
Well, if he does, I'll see
if my bear has a friend.

11:34.485 --> 11:37.045
Sheldon, have you ever considered
not rushing into something new?

11:37.154 --> 11:39.656
I mean, why don't you
take your time, enjoy your freedom?

11:39.824 --> 11:42.867
Maybe something new
to study will find you.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.037
That's actually not bad advice.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.665
You know, I didn't seek out
string theory.

11:48.791 --> 11:51.251
It just hit me
over the head one day.

11:51.419 --> 11:52.544
How does that happen?

11:52.712 --> 11:54.963
A bully chased me through
the school library

11:55.131 --> 11:57.882
and hit me over the head with
the biggest book he could find.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.845
OK, how about we toast
your newfound freedom?

12:03.013 --> 12:05.223
Normally I refrain from alcohol,

12:05.391 --> 12:08.435
but since my cerebral cortex is
twiddling its proverbial thumbs,

12:08.602 --> 12:10.311
why not soak it in grape juice

12:10.479 --> 12:12.772
that's been predigested
by a fungus?

12:14.191 --> 12:16.943
And you wonder why other
children beat you with books.

12:17.111 --> 12:18.319
Cheers!

12:21.115 --> 12:23.032
Emily, what do you do?

12:23.200 --> 12:25.493
I'm a dermatology resident
at Huntington Hospital.

12:25.661 --> 12:27.370
And you know what that means.

12:27.538 --> 12:31.124
Someone's skin's about
to be softer than ever.

12:32.418 --> 12:35.462
This is making me crazy.
I know I know you from somewhere.

12:35.629 --> 12:38.798
Howard was an astronaut.
Maybe that's where you saw him.

12:38.924 --> 12:42.260
Wow, that's amazing.
What was that like?

12:42.428 --> 12:45.221
It was the most incredible
experience of my life.

12:45.389 --> 12:48.099
Up there
in the space station, you're...

12:48.267 --> 12:50.226
Oh, my God, I remember.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.313
Can I finish my astronaut story?

12:53.481 --> 12:54.773
It was four years ago.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.858
- Please don't say it.
- We were set up on a blind date.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.693
- Please don't say it.
- You came to my apartment.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.820
You're saying it.

13:00.946 --> 13:02.489
Well, what happened?

13:02.656 --> 13:04.491
- Yeah, what happened?
- OK, I'll say it.

13:04.617 --> 13:09.037
I was on the way to pick her up.

13:09.205 --> 13:11.206
My stomach felt a little funny.

13:11.373 --> 13:14.459
When I got there, I asked
if I could use her bathroom.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.461
Please don't say it.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.508
One roll of toilet paper
and 20 minutes later,

13:21.675 --> 13:24.010
I was so humiliated,

13:24.178 --> 13:26.888
I snuck out the window
and never saw her again.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.515
You know what else
I never saw again:

13:28.682 --> 13:30.725
my security deposit.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.435
I'm sorry.

13:32.603 --> 13:35.563
I tried to unclog it,
but you didn't have a plunger,

13:35.731 --> 13:37.232
and water was
spilling out everywhere.

13:37.399 --> 13:39.025
Right, just water.

13:41.153 --> 13:43.404
Look, I have felt terrible
about this for years,

13:43.572 --> 13:47.575
and I'm glad I have the opportunity
to tell you just how sorry I am.

13:47.743 --> 13:49.744
It's fine.

13:49.912 --> 13:51.412
All my friends love this story.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.706
They call you Clogzilla.

13:54.750 --> 13:57.210
Get it? Because you
clogged up her bathroom

13:57.378 --> 13:59.963
like a radioactive monster!

14:00.089 --> 14:02.507
- Yeah, yeah, I get it.
- Howie.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.260
Well, hey, it's not like
cotton candy comes out of you.

14:08.138 --> 14:10.431
Come on, let's get you to bed.
You've had a lot to drink.

14:10.599 --> 14:12.016
No more than Penny.

14:12.184 --> 14:14.060
That's what I'm saying.

14:14.186 --> 14:17.397
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...

14:17.523 --> 14:23.736
Empty room.

14:23.904 --> 14:26.114
If somebody says "Come in,"
I'm gonna freak out.

14:31.954 --> 14:34.747
So, Emily, why did you decide
to specialize in dermatology?

14:34.915 --> 14:36.916
I like cutting people with knives,

14:37.084 --> 14:40.628
and all the other jobs where
you get to do that are illegal.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.382
You're kidding, right?

14:47.636 --> 14:50.638
She's scary,
but it's a cute scary.

14:51.599 --> 14:52.807
Can I say just one more thing?

14:52.975 --> 14:55.602
I had some kind
of food poisoning that day.

14:55.769 --> 14:58.438
Sure, in retrospect,
gas station sushi...

14:58.606 --> 14:59.981
maybe not the best choice.

15:00.149 --> 15:02.984
Nor was climbing out
your window and running away.

15:03.152 --> 15:05.820
But I think we can all understand
how humiliating that was,

15:05.988 --> 15:07.322
and I'd really appreciate it
if we could move on.

15:07.489 --> 15:09.324
Howie, we moved on
a long time ago.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.784
- I'm just saying...
- We moved on.

15:13.329 --> 15:15.955
OK. Fine.

15:18.959 --> 15:20.960
- How's your soup?
- It's all right.

15:21.128 --> 15:22.962
They could've filled
the bowl a little more.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.510
- Excuse me.
- Where are you going?

15:29.678 --> 15:32.639
- I need some fresh air.
- Been there.

15:53.577 --> 15:55.620
Oh, no.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.872
What have I done?

16:22.690 --> 16:24.857
How you feeling?

16:25.067 --> 16:26.150
Not so good.

16:28.153 --> 16:31.030
Are you gonna introduce me
to your friend?

16:32.449 --> 16:34.075
It's not my friend.

16:34.243 --> 16:36.244
Nothing happened.

16:36.412 --> 16:40.832
I don't know, I heard you reading
pretty loud last night.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.585
Oh, dear Lord.

16:44.753 --> 16:45.795
Where's Amy?

16:45.963 --> 16:47.964
After she put you to bed,
she went home.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.090
Oh.

16:49.800 --> 16:53.302
I should call her and apologize.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.182
- Oh, no.
- What?

16:58.350 --> 17:02.186
Apparently, I called
Stephen Hawking last night.

17:02.396 --> 17:04.439
First new message.

17:04.606 --> 17:06.399
Hawkman!

17:08.152 --> 17:12.822
It's your old buddy
Sheldonoscopy!

17:12.948 --> 17:15.283
How come you didn't
pick up the phone?

17:15.451 --> 17:17.994
Oh, right. My bad.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.917
You're awful quiet.
Everything OK?

17:25.878 --> 17:27.462
Not really.

17:27.629 --> 17:30.715
I had a bit
of an embarrassing evening.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.134
Me, too. What happened?

17:33.302 --> 17:35.136
I drank alcohol

17:35.304 --> 17:40.099
and may have left an unfortunate
voice mail for Stephen Hawking.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.560
I wouldn't worry about it.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.687
He's got a pretty good
sense of humor.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.523
I hope so.

17:47.691 --> 17:49.692
What happened to you last night?

17:49.860 --> 17:51.694
Well, turns out

17:51.862 --> 17:54.489
I'd already met the girl
Raj is seeing

17:54.656 --> 17:58.284
when I did a number
on her bathroom.

18:01.413 --> 18:03.289
And that number was two.

18:05.834 --> 18:08.711
Well, you know,
I've always been a fan

18:08.879 --> 18:11.714
of a story told
by Attar of Nishapur,

18:11.882 --> 18:15.802
about a king,
who assembled a group of wise men

18:15.969 --> 18:19.639
to create a ring that would
make him happy when he was sad.

18:19.807 --> 18:23.142
And that ring was inscribed
with the phrase,

18:23.310 --> 18:25.394
"This, too, shall pass."

18:27.231 --> 18:29.565
- Hey, Cooper!
- Oh, my God.

18:29.733 --> 18:33.236
I heard you drunk-dialed
Stephen Hawking last night?

18:33.403 --> 18:35.071
Classic!

18:35.239 --> 18:36.364
Get out of here, Barry.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.366
Whatever you say...

18:38.534 --> 18:40.868
...Clogzilla.

18:44.373 --> 18:46.124
Clogzilla. That's pretty funny.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.545
I don't think that's gonna pass.

18:55.092 --> 18:56.926
Next message.

18:57.094 --> 18:58.803
It's me again!

18:58.971 --> 19:01.097
I gave up string theory.

19:01.265 --> 19:03.015
You should give up black holes,

19:03.183 --> 19:07.395
and we can totally
solve crimes together!

19:07.521 --> 19:09.188
Next message.

19:09.356 --> 19:10.815
Do you know what's great?!

19:10.983 --> 19:12.942
Geology.

19:13.068 --> 19:14.193
Woo!

19:15.237 --> 19:17.071
Look at this geode!

19:17.239 --> 19:19.365
That's fun to say!

19:19.533 --> 19:23.786
Gee... ode! Gee... ode!

19:23.954 --> 19:25.454
Next message.

19:25.622 --> 19:27.623
Gee... ode!

19:28.333 --> 19:30.585
Gee... ode!

19:30.752 --> 19:32.962
I kiss girls now.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.424
Next message.

19:36.592 --> 19:39.552
Hey, guess who I am!
Beep, bop, boop, bop!

19:39.636 --> 19:41.929
I'm you! Get it?!

19:43.265 --> 19:45.016
Next message.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.144
Are you mad at me?

19:48.270 --> 19:51.147
Oh, no, you're mad at me.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.357
I'm so sorry!

19:53.942 --> 19:55.151
Beep, bop, boop, bop!

19:56.612 --> 19:58.112
Next message.

19:58.280 --> 20:03.117
Thiospinel sulfide.
Thiospinel sulfide.

20:03.285 --> 20:06.621
That's even more fun
than gee... ode.

20:07.664 --> 20:09.874
Hey, did you see The LEGO Movie?

20:13.462 --> 20:15.922
What a jackass.
