WEBVTT

00:05.255 --> 00:06.422
How's your mom holding up?

00:06.589 --> 00:09.508
She's doing okay,
but we just lost another nurse.

00:09.676 --> 00:10.759
How many is that now?

00:10.927 --> 00:14.430
Two, and I know what you're
she's eating them.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.976
She's just so impossible,
they keep quitting.

00:19.144 --> 00:20.602
So, who's watching her now?

00:20.770 --> 00:24.148
A bowl full of M&M's
with a few Ambien tossed in.

00:24.816 --> 00:25.816
What up, guys?

00:25.984 --> 00:26.984
- Hello.
- Hey.

00:28.153 --> 00:30.529
Okay, well, now that everyone's here,

00:30.697 --> 00:32.990
Penny and I have some big news.

00:33.825 --> 00:34.825
We're engaged!

00:34.993 --> 00:37.953
Oh, my God! Congratulations!

00:41.207 --> 00:43.767
And I thought me having sex with
Emily was gonna be the big news.

00:46.921 --> 00:49.006
- Oh, my God!
- Hey! Hey!

00:50.508 --> 00:52.384
What the hell!

00:53.261 --> 00:56.472
You guys propose all the time.
This never happens.

00:57.432 --> 00:58.849
You're right!

01:26.628 --> 01:28.587
Boy, I'm so hungry today.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.173
I wonder why?

01:33.009 --> 01:34.760
Because you had sex the other night?

01:35.845 --> 01:37.429
You know what?

01:37.597 --> 01:39.348
That may be it.

01:41.017 --> 01:43.018
By the way,
it isn't like riding a bike.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.020
Like, I fell off a few times.

01:47.982 --> 01:50.192
- Hey, buddy.
- Hello.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.527
You okay?

01:53.404 --> 01:55.614
I just got called
into President Siebert's office.

01:56.699 --> 01:58.700
The university
won't let me switch my field

01:58.868 --> 02:01.411
of study to inflationary
cosmology.

02:01.579 --> 02:04.206
They're forcing me
to continue with string theory.

02:04.374 --> 02:07.334
- Why?
- He said it's why they hired me,

02:07.585 --> 02:09.545
it's what my grant
was designated for,

02:09.712 --> 02:13.090
and that everybody has to
do things they don't want to do.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.218
He then gave an example
of something he had to do,

02:15.343 --> 02:18.262
even though he didn't want to,
which was look at my stupid face.

02:20.598 --> 02:23.976
That's a rude thing to say out loud.

02:26.437 --> 02:30.065
It's an outrage. Honestly, I'm
tempted to leave the university.

02:30.233 --> 02:32.234
You know, if you're
really serious about that,

02:32.402 --> 02:34.736
I hear there are some
exciting opportunities

02:34.904 --> 02:37.114
in home care for the old and fat.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.410
Whatever you do,
just don't make any rash decisions.

02:41.578 --> 02:44.246
I don't know. I am really aggravated.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.875
When I'm feeling low,
I have sex with a girl.

02:49.919 --> 02:51.628
But that's just me.

02:55.091 --> 02:56.842
- Oh, come on, give her a chance.
- No.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.261
No, life, it is too short.

03:01.097 --> 03:02.898
I know you've only been here
a day and a half,

03:03.057 --> 03:04.933
but you're like part of the family!

03:07.270 --> 03:10.147
I don't think the service
is gonna send any more people.

03:10.315 --> 03:15.277
Yeah, maybe it's time we just
release Ma back into the sea.

03:17.780 --> 03:18.864
That's not helpful.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.950
Well, then, we may need
to get used to the idea

03:22.118 --> 03:25.287
that we're gonna be living here
the next few months.

03:25.455 --> 03:28.707
But we have jobs.
We can't babysit her 24 hours a day.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.627
Well, what if we use
our vacation time?

03:31.794 --> 03:35.464
I wanted to go to Hawaii, not Hell.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.507
I don't know what else we can do.

03:38.551 --> 03:42.930
Howie, I love you, and as your wife,
your mother is every bit

03:43.097 --> 03:46.183
as much my problem
as she is yours, so...

03:47.477 --> 03:49.603
...I want a divorce.

03:53.524 --> 03:54.566
Hello, Leonard.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.109
Hi, Mom.

03:56.277 --> 03:58.070
I have some exciting news.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.906
I'm listening.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.951
Before I tell you,
will you promise to try

04:04.118 --> 04:07.663
and be happy for me and keep
any concerns you have to yourself?

04:08.706 --> 04:09.748
No.

04:12.001 --> 04:15.379
Let me save you all
of your hemming and hawing.

04:15.546 --> 04:18.507
Sheldon already told me
that you and Penny are engaged.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.844
I hate that you talk to him
more than you talk to me.

04:23.012 --> 04:25.347
Would you like for you
and me to talk more?

04:27.892 --> 04:30.352
You know what? It's probably fine.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.730
In any event,
while I've had my misgivings

04:33.898 --> 04:36.024
about... Penny...

04:37.610 --> 04:39.653
...Sheldon spoke very fondly of her,

04:39.821 --> 04:41.655
and if she is good enough for him,

04:41.823 --> 04:43.865
then she's good enough for me.

04:46.577 --> 04:50.122
I'm your son. What about the fact
that she's good enough for me?

04:52.208 --> 04:53.750
Sure.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.336
Thanks, Mom.

04:56.504 --> 04:58.338
Leonard, would it make
you feel better

04:58.506 --> 05:02.592
to hear that your mother
approved of your life choices?

05:04.387 --> 05:05.595
Yes, it would.

05:05.763 --> 05:09.099
Yeah, well, you should work on that.

05:13.396 --> 05:17.482
No, Mom, it's the same guy I've gone
out with for the past two years.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.693
Yeah, the scientist.

05:19.861 --> 05:24.239
Well, it's complicated. I mean, he
works with lasers and atomic magnets.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.037
No, I did not see it coming.

05:30.204 --> 05:33.332
No, we did not set a date.
No, I'm not pregnant.

05:34.959 --> 05:37.210
Yeah, this is a first for our family.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.797
All right, tell Dad I love him.
I gotta go. All right, bye.

05:40.965 --> 05:44.259
- Atomic magnets?
- Shut up.

05:45.636 --> 05:47.179
Sorry I'm late.
The leaf blower broke,

05:47.347 --> 05:49.931
so I had to hand-dry
my mother-in-law.

05:51.267 --> 05:53.602
- You want some wine?
- Thanks.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.396
Little warning before you jump
into this marriage business:

05:56.564 --> 05:58.805
you're not just marrying him,
you're marrying his family.

05:58.941 --> 06:01.109
I think Leonard's mom's okay with me.

06:01.277 --> 06:03.558
It doesn't matter if she's okay
with you. The question is:

06:03.571 --> 06:05.614
can she go
to the bathroom by herself?

06:11.245 --> 06:12.788
Hit me again.

06:14.582 --> 06:16.666
So, what are the living
arrangements gonna be?

06:16.834 --> 06:19.127
Well, haven't really talked
about it yet, but I figure,

06:19.295 --> 06:21.775
at some point, I'll move in
with him, or he'll move in with me.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.216
Well, with you not working,
that makes financial sense.

06:24.384 --> 06:28.136
You're not working! How would you
like a job in home health care?

06:29.138 --> 06:30.305
Not a chance.

06:30.473 --> 06:31.973
- Please. I'm desperate.
- No.

06:32.141 --> 06:34.226
- I'll pay you anything you want.
- Okay, then, yeah.

06:36.312 --> 06:38.313
No! Keep your money!

06:42.693 --> 06:45.195
I could've ridden
a bull longer than that.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.575
What you working on?

06:50.743 --> 06:53.120
I'm writing an appeal
to the Faculty Senate,

06:53.287 --> 06:55.163
so that I can move
on from string theory.

06:55.331 --> 06:56.581
How's it going?

06:58.000 --> 06:59.042
You tell me.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.337
"Dear esteemed colleagues,

07:02.505 --> 07:05.382
As you may know, I have requested
to change my field of study.

07:05.550 --> 07:09.594
My decision to do so is, I believe,
in the best interest of science.

07:09.762 --> 07:12.347
At your convenience,
I'd be happy to explain it to you

07:12.515 --> 07:15.016
in words you'll understand."

07:17.103 --> 07:19.187
It's nice that
you called them esteemed.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.065
You're right. I'll take that out.

07:23.985 --> 07:26.862
So, listen, there was something
I was hoping to float past you.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.156
Now that Penny and I are engaged,

07:29.323 --> 07:31.763
I thought we might want to talk
about our living arrangements.

07:32.785 --> 07:33.827
Of course.

07:33.995 --> 07:36.788
She's spent many nights here,
and you're worried

07:36.956 --> 07:40.959
about preserving the myth
of her virginity before the wedding.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.338
- I'm not.
- Good,

07:45.506 --> 07:46.715
because not only
has that ship sailed,

07:46.883 --> 07:49.718
if it hit an iceberg,
countless men would perish.

07:52.096 --> 07:54.377
Actually, this is about
where she and I are going to live.

07:54.432 --> 07:55.891
What do you mean?

07:56.058 --> 07:58.894
Well, well, we might
want to live together.

07:59.061 --> 08:02.230
Oh, yeah, well, I've already
given this some thought,

08:02.398 --> 08:06.860
and I'm willing
to let Penny live with us

08:07.028 --> 08:09.446
one day a week for a trial period.

08:11.407 --> 08:14.284
Now, obviously,
not when she's made cranky

08:14.452 --> 08:17.245
by the shedding
of her uterine lining.

08:19.290 --> 08:20.332
That's very sweet.

08:22.251 --> 08:26.546
But we were thinking more of us
maybe living together with...

08:27.507 --> 08:28.507
...not you.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.345
I don't understand.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.766
How could we all live together
if I'm not there?

08:39.769 --> 08:41.853
Look, I know this is...
this is change,

08:42.021 --> 08:44.606
- and that sounds scary...
- Where are you going to go?

08:44.774 --> 08:46.441
I don't know.

08:46.609 --> 08:48.610
We just started to think about this.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.028
Maybe I'll move in with Penny,

08:50.196 --> 08:53.031
or maybe she and I'll take this
place, you can move across the hall.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.200
Move across the hall?

08:56.118 --> 08:58.662
Did you take a marijuana?

09:01.624 --> 09:03.124
No, I did not.

09:03.292 --> 09:05.794
Did you get hit on the head
with a coconut?

09:06.963 --> 09:08.964
- No.
- Well, then, I'm all out of guesses.

09:09.131 --> 09:12.551
What? Me move across the hall... Why
would you even suggest such a thing?

09:12.718 --> 09:16.346
Because I love Penny, and want
to give her the life she deserves.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.223
I see.

09:18.391 --> 09:21.518
You're putting your future
bride's happiness above mine.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.314
Well, yeah.

09:28.192 --> 09:29.317
Wow.

09:35.324 --> 09:38.660
How dare the university force me
to go back to string theory!

09:38.828 --> 09:40.495
They just don't appreciate you.

09:40.663 --> 09:43.123
Yeah, and on top of that,
Leonard has the audacity

09:43.291 --> 09:45.500
to suggest that now
that he and Penny are engaged,

09:45.668 --> 09:47.669
he may not want
to live with me anymore.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.588
Here, I made you
some Strawberry Quik.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.506
I have real problems here, Amy.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.384
I can't be mollified with
a beverage designed for children.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.012
Mm. Yummy.

09:59.056 --> 10:00.736
You know,
this might work out for the best.

10:00.850 --> 10:04.102
You're always complaining about
what a terrible roommate Leonard is.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.855
Like how he turns up
the thermostat when you're not there.

10:07.023 --> 10:10.358
Ugh. It's like
walking into the Amazon.

10:10.526 --> 10:12.569
And not the good Amazon
with one-day shipping.

10:12.737 --> 10:15.155
The awful one with birds and snakes.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.783
You hate the sound of all
those keys on his key chain.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.869
Four keys!

10:21.037 --> 10:23.204
Who does he think he is, a warden?

10:25.207 --> 10:26.916
See? Maybe you'll love living alone.

10:27.084 --> 10:29.711
I don't know. Perhaps.

10:29.879 --> 10:34.049
And if it turns out you don't...
you and I could live together.

10:34.216 --> 10:36.384
You and...
Oh, sure.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.429
And while we're at it,
why don't we get engaged, too?

10:39.597 --> 10:41.514
Why don't we get a little house,
start a family?

10:41.682 --> 10:45.143
Enjoy our sunset years together?
Do you hear yourself, woman?

10:47.229 --> 10:49.773
- Sheldon, it was just a thought.
- No. Here's a thought.

10:49.940 --> 10:52.067
You're not moving in,
Leonard's not moving out,

10:52.234 --> 10:54.402
everything stays
exactly the way it is.

10:54.570 --> 10:57.739
And by the way, I saw you make
this Strawberry Quik with syrup,

10:57.907 --> 11:00.533
and you're supposed
to use the powder!

11:01.160 --> 11:03.495
- It tastes the same.
- No. The syrup tastes better,

11:03.663 --> 11:05.163
and I don't like it.

11:08.459 --> 11:11.336
This is so sweet!
You never cook for me.

11:11.504 --> 11:14.297
Well, you cook for me
all the time and...

11:16.967 --> 11:19.678
If you don't like my cooking,
why haven't you ever said anything?

11:19.845 --> 11:23.223
It's hard to talk
with so much heavy chewing to do.

11:24.975 --> 11:28.019
- Sorry. I'll get better.
- I know you'll try.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.649
So, should we talk
about setting a date?

11:32.817 --> 11:35.377
Well, I'd like to pick one that works
with my brother's schedule.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.028
Okay, and when would that be?

11:37.738 --> 11:40.365
Uh, 12 to 18 months from now,
depending on good behavior.

11:43.327 --> 11:45.787
- Hi, is Sheldon here?
- No, I thought he was with you.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.831
He was, but he stormed off.

11:47.998 --> 11:50.125
- Now he isn't answering his phone.
- What happened?

11:50.292 --> 11:52.377
He was really angry
that you suggested he move out.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.795
Oh.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.714
I also mentioned
that he and I could live together,

11:55.881 --> 11:58.550
but he was too mad at you to realize
what a great idea that is.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.138
Well, he's been having
a couple of tough days.

12:03.305 --> 12:04.389
I'm sure he's fine.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.058
He probably just needs
a little alone time to decompress.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.185
You're probably right.

12:09.353 --> 12:11.146
So, what are you guys doing?

12:13.482 --> 12:17.068
Well, Leonard cooked for me and now
we're just having a nice dinner,

12:17.236 --> 12:19.654
you know, as a newly engaged couple.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.281
That's nice.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.872
Anyway, as I was saying,

12:29.039 --> 12:31.750
Sheldon probably just
needs a little alone time.

12:33.627 --> 12:35.920
'Cause that's important.

12:38.340 --> 12:40.467
Not just for him, but for...

12:41.469 --> 12:43.344
...most anybody, really.

12:43.512 --> 12:45.638
Don't I know it.

12:45.806 --> 12:47.432
- What is that, polenta?
- Amy, get out.

12:47.683 --> 12:48.725
Right.

12:54.398 --> 12:55.398
No.

12:59.445 --> 13:00.445
Hey, Sheldon.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.197
What happened?

13:02.364 --> 13:04.199
I was cooking
in the back room last night

13:04.366 --> 13:08.286
- and the hot plate caught on fire.
- And you couldn't put it out?

13:08.454 --> 13:11.080
I was across the street
at the do-it-yourself car wash,

13:11.248 --> 13:12.582
taking a shower.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.378
So when will you reopen?

13:17.671 --> 13:22.133
Um, I don't know. I'm waiting to hear
back from the insurance company.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.719
So, tomorrow?

13:26.096 --> 13:28.056
I don't mean to be rude,
Sheldon, but,

13:28.224 --> 13:30.225
my life is kind of
falling apart right now.

13:30.392 --> 13:31.643
Your life?

13:31.811 --> 13:34.354
The university is making me
do string theory,

13:34.522 --> 13:37.899
and my girlfriend loves me
so much she wants to live with me.

13:39.318 --> 13:43.571
And now, the place I need to go when
I'm sad is damp and smells funny.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.450
Well, sorry I let you down.

13:47.618 --> 13:50.245
No, I do not accept this.

13:50.412 --> 13:52.580
Everything is changing and I hate it.

13:52.748 --> 13:55.416
It stops now. I'm helping you
get back on your feet.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.338
I would like to purchase
this comic book, please.

14:02.466 --> 14:03.675
That'll be $2.99.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.427
Really? It's soaking wet.

14:07.471 --> 14:08.471
Fine, a dollar.

14:11.892 --> 14:14.686
- Can you break a 20?
- No, I only have hundreds.

14:16.730 --> 14:18.356
You know what?

14:18.524 --> 14:20.817
I don't always recognize sarcasm,
but I do right now,

14:20.985 --> 14:22.944
and I don't appreciate it.

14:23.112 --> 14:24.612
I'm sorry for your loss.

14:24.780 --> 14:27.615
But you're not the only one
whose day has been a disaster.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.624
That could have killed me.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.628
I can't catch a break.

14:43.173 --> 14:45.717
I haven't heard from Sheldon
in a while. You think he's okay?

14:45.885 --> 14:47.135
Oh, I'm sure he's fine.

14:48.262 --> 14:50.179
I'm gonna see where he is.

14:50.347 --> 14:51.347
How?

14:51.515 --> 14:53.641
I know his password,
so I can track his phone.

14:53.809 --> 14:55.226
You do that?

14:55.394 --> 14:58.396
Not always, but ever since
he wandered off at the swap meet

14:58.564 --> 15:00.565
chasing a balloon, I get worried.

15:01.650 --> 15:03.192
He can take care of himself.

15:03.360 --> 15:06.988
Look, we went over stranger danger
and gave him that whistle.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.157
That's weird.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.784
- What?
- He's at the train station.

15:11.952 --> 15:13.161
So? He loves trains.

15:13.329 --> 15:16.497
It's dark out and he's alone,
I don't like it. Let's go get him.

15:16.665 --> 15:20.001
Oh, it's sweet how you look out
for him. You're a good guy.

15:20.169 --> 15:23.630
Not just that. My mother would kill
me if I let something happen to him.

15:28.344 --> 15:32.430
- Dude, I'm so sorry.
- Don't take this the wrong way,

15:32.598 --> 15:35.183
but did you do this
for the insurance money?

15:35.351 --> 15:38.561
No. God, you sound
like the police, the firemen,

15:38.729 --> 15:41.439
my parents, my therapist
and the insurance company.

15:43.108 --> 15:45.360
We're here for you, man.
Whatever you need, okay?

15:45.527 --> 15:48.237
Actually, I was wondering if I could
crash at your place for a few nights.

15:48.405 --> 15:51.407
Sure, of course. Oh, actually,
Emily was gonna spend the night.

15:52.284 --> 15:54.410
You slept with her? Nice.

15:54.578 --> 15:58.164
Well, I can't take all the credit.
She let me do it to her, but...

16:01.251 --> 16:02.919
But I can always
call her and cancel.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.380
Hang on.
I know a place you can stay,

16:05.547 --> 16:07.548
and earn some money at the same time.

16:07.716 --> 16:09.550
- Great.
- I just have to warn you,

16:09.718 --> 16:13.554
it'll involve humiliation,
degradation and verbal abuse.

16:14.848 --> 16:16.933
So what's the catch?

16:23.023 --> 16:24.107
Sheldon.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.651
You tracked my phone?

16:26.819 --> 16:28.069
Yeah.

16:28.237 --> 16:31.906
Boy, you chase one balloon
for three miles.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.077
We were worried about you.

16:36.245 --> 16:38.329
Don't be melodramatic.

16:38.497 --> 16:41.416
I'm just getting on a train
and leaving forever.

16:42.960 --> 16:46.254
Seriously? You don't even have
a change of clothes or a toothbrush.

16:46.422 --> 16:49.257
My plan is to stop
at malls and buy what I need.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.300
It's called living off the land.

16:52.261 --> 16:55.596
Okay, I know you're upset
and there's a lot of stuff going on,

16:55.764 --> 16:58.766
but it's nothing we can't work out.
Come on, let's get you home.

16:58.934 --> 17:02.770
No. I've reached my breaking point.
I need to leave. Now.

17:02.938 --> 17:05.523
- And go where?
- It doesn't matter.

17:05.691 --> 17:08.818
So a few things don't go your way,

17:08.986 --> 17:12.780
and your best decision
is to ride the rails like a hobo?

17:14.950 --> 17:16.617
I suppose it is.

17:16.785 --> 17:18.619
Except I have a credit card.

17:18.787 --> 17:21.831
And I refuse to carry
my laptop at the end of a stick.

17:24.918 --> 17:27.795
And I'd sooner die
than eat beans out of a can.

17:29.298 --> 17:32.008
Come on, come home with us and
tomorrow I'll take you to Legoland.

17:32.176 --> 17:34.844
Legoland is not
the solution to everything.

17:35.888 --> 17:39.223
And it's too much of a scene
since that movie came out.

17:41.185 --> 17:44.562
- Then what can I do?
- Leonard, I am overwhelmed.

17:45.647 --> 17:48.524
Everything is changing
and it's simply too much.

17:48.692 --> 17:50.193
I need to get away and think.

17:50.360 --> 17:53.112
Oh, come on,
you know you're overreacting.

17:53.280 --> 17:56.074
Leonard, hang on.
Just... come here for a second.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.994
Maybe we need to let him go.

18:00.162 --> 18:02.997
- What! Why?
- It might be good for him.

18:03.165 --> 18:06.000
You know he can't
take a trip like this by himself.

18:06.168 --> 18:09.253
- He's a grown man.
- No, he looks like a grown man.

18:11.757 --> 18:14.008
You've seen Freaky Friday,
sometimes little kids

18:14.176 --> 18:16.177
end up in big person bodies.

18:17.596 --> 18:19.388
Leonard,
we can't protect him forever.

18:19.556 --> 18:22.725
- I know, but...
- He'll be okay.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.519
You taught him well, Padawan.

18:24.686 --> 18:29.107
Good Lord! Padawan's the student,
not the teacher.

18:31.026 --> 18:32.693
Seriously, let him go.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.869
Sheldon, if you really need to
do this, I won't stand in your way.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.205
I do.

18:45.541 --> 18:48.376
Okay. Good luck.

18:52.923 --> 18:54.715
Be safe and call us.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.053
I will.

19:01.515 --> 19:02.515
Bye, buddy.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.106
- Sheldon...
- Yes?

19:11.567 --> 19:12.650
I'm gonna miss you.

19:14.319 --> 19:16.195
Of course you are.

19:18.782 --> 19:20.616
He just made that easier.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.251
Hey!

19:33.255 --> 19:36.299
What are you guys still doing here?
I got this, go. Go home.

19:38.093 --> 19:39.886
You sure?

19:41.180 --> 19:44.060
Yeah, she's fed, she took her pills,
she's all tucked in and watching TV.

19:44.641 --> 19:46.184
So, she's not too much for you?

19:46.351 --> 19:49.145
Are you kidding?
I love her, she's great.

19:50.814 --> 19:53.316
Stewie, you gonna watch
Wheel of Fortune with me?

19:53.483 --> 19:55.443
Coming, Debbie.

19:57.446 --> 20:00.198
- You call her Debbie?
- She insisted.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.825
So, hey, guys, thank you so much.

20:02.993 --> 20:04.827
This job is a dream come true.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.461
Was that a little weird?

20:13.629 --> 20:14.754
Yeah.

20:14.922 --> 20:18.341
I don't know why,
but something about it feels...

20:18.508 --> 20:20.134
...unnatural.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.305
- Okay, let's go.
- Yep.

20:26.975 --> 20:28.976
Okay, Sheldon,
thanks for checking in.

20:29.144 --> 20:31.062
Talk to you tomorrow?

20:31.230 --> 20:32.730
Okay, bye.

20:33.815 --> 20:35.316
He's okay?

20:35.484 --> 20:37.235
Actually sounds like
he's doing pretty well.

20:37.402 --> 20:39.612
I really think
this is gonna be for the best.

20:39.780 --> 20:43.115
Me too. And he was able
to take a sabbatical from...

20:43.283 --> 20:45.660
How could you let him go!
