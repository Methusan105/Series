WEBVTT

00:03.586 --> 00:06.255
In the lead,
the left-side competitor.

00:08.258 --> 00:09.842
Wow, you're really good at this.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.302
Well, I have an extremely
low center of gravity.

00:13.263 --> 00:14.763
I'm like a pyramid.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.394
How you doing over there?

00:20.520 --> 00:22.604
Oh, I hope it's just a sprain.

00:23.982 --> 00:25.691
I cannot walk into that ER

00:25.734 --> 00:27.526
with another video game injury.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.447
Hey, Sheldon,
you want to play next?

00:31.573 --> 00:34.033
Oh, I would,
but I'm on my way out.

00:34.159 --> 00:35.701
- Where?
- Texas.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.455
Right now? Why?

00:39.622 --> 00:40.998
- Is someone sick?
- Yes.

00:41.124 --> 00:44.293
My sister's uterus came
down with a baby.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.463
Oh, she's pregnant?
That's great.

00:47.589 --> 00:49.423
You're gone an uncle...
Uncle Sheldon.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.967
No, I will be Uncle Dr. Cooper.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.137
How come you never said
she was pregnant?

00:55.305 --> 00:57.139
Well, I never told you
about my brother's kidney stone.

00:57.307 --> 00:58.390
You want to hear about everything

00:58.516 --> 01:00.225
that comes out
of my family's genitals?

01:01.603 --> 01:03.020
Well, congrats, and it's nice

01:03.146 --> 01:04.480
you're gonna be
there for your sister.

01:04.606 --> 01:07.191
Yes. I'm filling in for her
husband who's recovering

01:07.317 --> 01:09.485
from a horrible motorcycle accident.

01:09.652 --> 01:11.737
Lucky duck.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.531
Wow, so, how long will you be gone?

01:14.657 --> 01:16.325
Well, she's due tomorrow.

01:16.493 --> 01:18.452
Although it did take her
six years to finish high school,

01:18.578 --> 01:19.870
so who knows?

01:20.580 --> 01:22.122
Can I give you a ride to the airport?

01:22.248 --> 01:24.833
Oh, no, thank you, I don't want
to be an inconvenience.

01:25.627 --> 01:27.836
Chop-chop, Leonard.
We leave in ten minutes.

01:56.032 --> 01:57.282
All right, here's the deal.

01:57.450 --> 02:00.744
Sheldon is gone, so the tree
decorating rules are out the window.

02:00.912 --> 02:02.746
Yeah, which means
we don't have to use

02:02.872 --> 02:05.791
his ridiculous
ornament-spacing template.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.836
And I'm happy to report
its Kickstarter campaign

02:08.962 --> 02:10.671
is holding strong at zero dollars.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.049
Wait, so Star Wars
and Star Trek characters

02:14.217 --> 02:15.717
can go on the same branch?

02:16.302 --> 02:17.469
I know, it's crazy.

02:17.595 --> 02:19.471
Welcome to the Thunderdome, people!

02:19.597 --> 02:20.764
Woo!

02:21.432 --> 02:23.684
I've never done this before.
It's kind of fun.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.353
Yeah, if your mom could see
her little Bar Mitzvah boy right now,

02:26.479 --> 02:27.519
she'd have a heart attack.

02:27.605 --> 02:29.523
Good idea, I'll take a picture.

02:34.195 --> 02:35.904
Honey, I'm a little strapped
for cash this year,

02:36.072 --> 02:38.657
so for Christmas I was
thinking of giving you...

02:39.409 --> 02:40.409
...this.

02:42.245 --> 02:43.453
I love it.

02:43.580 --> 02:44.788
Okay.

02:44.914 --> 02:46.748
But it is what you got me last year.

02:46.916 --> 02:48.917
- Yeah.
- And last night.

02:49.919 --> 02:52.421
Hello.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.589
Hi, Stuart.

02:53.923 --> 02:56.216
Oh, good, I'm glad you guys
didn't wait for me to start.

02:56.342 --> 03:00.220
Although you said 7:00
and it's 7:00. That's fine.

03:02.765 --> 03:05.267
Oh, it's probably Sheldon.

03:06.227 --> 03:07.227
Hi, Sheldon.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.271
Everybody's here, say hi.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.439
- Hi.
- Hey, buddy.

03:10.481 --> 03:11.106
Hey.

03:11.274 --> 03:12.274
- Howdy.
- Hi.

03:12.275 --> 03:13.567
Hello.

03:15.945 --> 03:17.026
The second I go out of town

03:17.113 --> 03:19.072
you throw a Christmas
party without me?

03:19.449 --> 03:20.949
Yeah, kind of.

03:21.075 --> 03:24.286
That's so thoughtful.
You guys are the best.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.164
Hey, how's your sister?

03:27.290 --> 03:29.458
She went into labor an hour ago.

03:29.834 --> 03:32.169
That's wonderful.
So you're at the hospital?

03:32.295 --> 03:34.963
No, she chose to have a home
birth... because she wants

03:35.089 --> 03:38.634
to live in the Stone Age
and a cave wasn't available.

03:40.011 --> 03:42.012
You know, many people believe

03:42.138 --> 03:44.014
that home births are better
because the mother

03:44.140 --> 03:45.620
is in a warm, comfortable environment

03:45.683 --> 03:47.643
where she can be
nurtured by loved ones.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.394
And turn the bedroom floor

03:49.520 --> 03:52.105
into an amniotic Slip 'n Slide.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.068
Shelly, come on!

03:56.194 --> 03:58.195
Your sister's fully dilated

03:58.238 --> 03:59.655
and she wants
a nice family picture

03:59.822 --> 04:02.783
before there's blood everywhere!

04:02.909 --> 04:04.409
Oh, boy.

04:04.535 --> 04:08.205
I picked the wrong day
to wear my good robot T-shirt.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.042
If you were having Sheldon's baby

04:12.168 --> 04:13.961
would you really want him
in the room?

04:14.170 --> 04:15.921
Yeah, if he's in the room
when they're making the baby,

04:16.047 --> 04:17.839
I'll give you ten dollars.

04:19.550 --> 04:21.151
Hey, I brought over
It's a Wonderful Life

04:21.302 --> 04:22.511
if you guys want to watch it later.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.680
- Oh, I love that movie.
- I've never seen it.

04:24.847 --> 04:26.556
- Me neither.
- It's great.

04:26.766 --> 04:29.518
It's Christmas time and
Jimmy Stewart's really depressed

04:29.644 --> 04:32.020
and he's gonna jump
off a bridge and kill himself...

04:32.188 --> 04:34.022
Don't need to see it.
Living it.

04:35.358 --> 04:36.400
But then he gets to see
what the world

04:36.526 --> 04:38.819
would be like
if he'd never been born.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.320
Hey, you ever imagine
what that would be like?

04:40.405 --> 04:41.571
Not being born?

04:41.698 --> 04:43.323
What do you think?

04:43.449 --> 04:46.702
What do you think?

04:48.913 --> 04:50.747
You make jokes about Sheldon,

04:50.873 --> 04:52.082
but if it weren't for him,

04:52.208 --> 04:55.210
I don't think any of us would be
sitting in this room right now.

04:55.545 --> 04:56.962
Really? Sheldon not being here

04:57.088 --> 04:59.464
is the main reason I'm in this room.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.676
It's true.

05:02.802 --> 05:04.386
None of you would know me.

05:04.554 --> 05:06.138
You wouldn't know Bernadette.

05:06.264 --> 05:08.557
- You wouldn't be dating Penny.
- You don't know that.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.392
I've been going to the
Cheesecake Factory for years.

05:10.518 --> 05:11.599
I could have picked her up.

05:15.815 --> 05:18.233
Oh, you weren't joking.

05:18.359 --> 05:19.151
No.

05:19.277 --> 05:20.694
Okay, sweetie, let me tell you

05:20.820 --> 05:22.654
exactly how that
would have gone down.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.451
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna ask her out.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.579
I'm gonna squirt chocolate milk
out of my nipples.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.792
Sorry, I thought we're saying things
that are never gonna happen.

05:35.918 --> 05:38.170
Maybe this time
he's going to do it.

05:38.296 --> 05:40.172
Hope you're thirsty, here it comes.

05:42.925 --> 05:43.925
Watch me.

05:45.386 --> 05:47.596
Hey, you guys ready to order
or you need a few minutes?

05:47.722 --> 05:50.557
...A few minutes it is.

05:51.934 --> 05:54.853
You didn't ask her out,
but that was a lot of sounds.

05:56.564 --> 05:58.148
You guys are making me nervous.

05:58.274 --> 05:59.754
Fine, then go talk to her
on your own.

06:00.735 --> 06:01.735
I will.

06:09.118 --> 06:11.286
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

06:11.579 --> 06:14.539
Hi... I'm Leonard?

06:14.791 --> 06:17.125
Really? You don't sound so sure.

06:18.294 --> 06:19.961
No, I am he.

06:23.132 --> 06:24.633
Anyway...

06:24.926 --> 06:29.304
There's been something I've wanted
to ask you for a long time.

06:29.430 --> 06:30.472
What's that?

06:30.598 --> 06:33.350
I was wondering,
if you're not too busy...

06:35.103 --> 06:37.771
...if you'd be interested in...

06:38.564 --> 06:41.400
...telling me where the restroom is?

06:45.613 --> 06:47.114
I think you're too late.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.825
Come on, I would not
have peed my pants.

06:51.994 --> 06:53.870
- She nailed it.
- Sounds about right.

06:54.872 --> 06:58.083
But, you forget,
I did ask you out in real life.

06:58.334 --> 07:00.460
Which couldn't have happened
if you didn't live across the hall from her

07:00.545 --> 07:02.305
which couldn't have
happened without Sheldon.

07:02.338 --> 07:03.672
Same goes with you guys.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.048
If Leonard wasn't with Penny,

07:05.174 --> 07:06.675
she never would have set you up.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.427
Doesn't matter.
Bernadette still would've been working

07:08.553 --> 07:09.719
at The Cheesecake Factory,

07:09.846 --> 07:12.889
and I still would've been
working this beefcake factory.

07:15.184 --> 07:16.643
You would've been all over me.

07:17.019 --> 07:18.186
Well...

07:21.149 --> 07:22.899
Hey, Penny, can I take that table?

07:23.025 --> 07:24.025
Sure, why?

07:24.152 --> 07:25.777
The one in the turtleneck is cute.

07:26.279 --> 07:29.865
Open wide,
here comes the happy train.

07:31.868 --> 07:35.620
Mm-hm...
Chug-a chug-a, yum, yum.

07:39.041 --> 07:40.792
Hang on.

07:41.711 --> 07:44.212
You got a...
You got a little something.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.134
Never mind.

07:51.220 --> 07:54.890
...Oh, man, that is so us.

07:59.228 --> 08:01.069
You know, maybe you and I
wouldn't be together,

08:01.189 --> 08:02.949
but you wouldn't have
done so great yourself.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.399
- Why?
- Because I know exactly

08:04.525 --> 08:06.693
the kind of guy you
would've ended up with.

08:09.447 --> 08:10.739
Hey, babe.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.991
Hey. Did you remember
to pay the rent?

08:13.117 --> 08:15.660
Better. I used the money
to buy these magic beans.

08:17.079 --> 08:20.123
He may be an idiot, but at least
he didn't pee himself.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.211
Hold on.

08:25.796 --> 08:27.881
Aw, babe, I peed myself.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.635
Me, too.

08:38.184 --> 08:40.936
The end.

08:45.566 --> 08:46.566
Hi, Sheldon.

08:46.692 --> 08:47.859
Everything okay?

08:48.277 --> 08:50.028
No, it's not.

08:50.988 --> 08:52.614
I've seen things.

08:53.991 --> 08:55.283
Lady things.

08:57.912 --> 08:59.788
Listen to me.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.499
That is not the way
they usually look.

09:05.628 --> 09:06.962
It doesn't matter.

09:07.129 --> 09:09.422
This is no way
to make new humans.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.550
People coming out of people.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.387
It's some kind of dirty magic show.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.557
Sheldon Lee Cooper.

09:18.683 --> 09:21.101
You get back
in this room right now.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.561
And bring a mop.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.938
Did you hear that?

09:25.106 --> 09:26.147
A mop.

09:26.566 --> 09:29.025
I have two PhDs yet
somehow I'm the janitor

09:29.151 --> 09:30.652
of my sister's birth canal.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.995
Hey, Sheldon sent us all
an e-mail.

09:40.329 --> 09:42.247
"Happy holidays from Texas."

09:42.498 --> 09:43.915
And there's pictures.

09:44.041 --> 09:46.167
Ah! Don't open them.
Do not open them.

09:47.169 --> 09:50.964
Oh, come on.
Childbirth is a natural, beautiful...

09:51.090 --> 09:54.134
Oh, it's like someone
sawed a cow in half.

09:56.304 --> 10:00.348
My father's a gynecologist,
I think I can handle it.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.892
And, now I'm gay.

10:05.479 --> 10:06.688
You know, I was thinking,

10:06.856 --> 10:08.481
without Sheldon most of us
would have never met,

10:08.608 --> 10:10.525
but Penny would still
live across from him.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.445
And with Leonard out of the picture,

10:13.571 --> 10:15.030
we all know what that would mean.

10:15.781 --> 10:16.823
We do?

10:20.453 --> 10:21.578
Hey, Sheldon.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.163
Hello.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.916
Doing laundry?

10:30.921 --> 10:32.964
Of course I'm doing laundry.

10:33.090 --> 10:34.674
Saturday night is laundry night,

10:34.800 --> 10:37.177
and I'm in a laundry room, so...

10:37.303 --> 10:39.054
I believe your inference is justified.

10:39.221 --> 10:41.598
My inference is justified.

10:41.724 --> 10:44.267
Sheldon, you are so funny.

10:47.438 --> 10:49.439
Anyway, I need to do my laundry, too,

10:49.565 --> 10:52.400
because these clothes are so dirty.

10:53.152 --> 10:56.821
Almost as dirty as the dirty girl
who's wearing them.

10:59.260 --> 11:00.260
Okay, that's enough.

11:00.284 --> 11:02.827
- Disagree.
- Keep going.

11:05.122 --> 11:07.207
So, what do you think?

11:08.709 --> 11:12.170
A tad asymmetrical,
but nothing to be concerned about.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.715
Please, Sheldon. I need you.

11:16.717 --> 11:19.094
To... what?

11:20.012 --> 11:21.179
To take me.

11:21.305 --> 11:24.224
I'm not taking you anywhere
till you put on a shirt.

11:26.852 --> 11:29.270
Come on, Sheldon.
You and me right here.

11:29.438 --> 11:31.940
Penny, for the thousandth time,

11:32.108 --> 11:35.110
I'm saving myself
for someone special.

11:35.277 --> 11:38.905
Perhaps a cute
bespectacled neuroscientist

11:39.031 --> 11:41.866
with hair the color of mud.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.078
I think I know how
to change your mind.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.123
- That's enough.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.584
I was okay with it.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.424
How's it going, Sheldon?

11:57.550 --> 11:59.426
Actually, much better.

11:59.677 --> 12:01.052
Oh, good.
Is the baby born yet?

12:01.178 --> 12:03.179
I don't know.
I just got back.

12:03.347 --> 12:04.347
Where'd you go?

12:04.432 --> 12:07.308
My mother asked me
to get some towels.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.352
I took advantage
of the vague request

12:09.478 --> 12:11.604
and went to Bed, Bath & Beyond.

12:15.151 --> 12:18.153
Excuse me! I'm on the phone!

12:19.655 --> 12:21.156
So rude.

12:23.701 --> 12:27.203
Here's another one.
Penny, if it weren't for Sheldon,

12:27.329 --> 12:31.708
you never would have met
comic book legend Stan Lee.

12:33.043 --> 12:34.377
Great.

12:37.339 --> 12:40.258
At least Leonard, Howard and I
would have always been friends.

12:40.843 --> 12:43.044
Hey, how come you three never
got an apartment together?

12:43.179 --> 12:45.263
We talked about it,
but Howard was in

12:45.389 --> 12:48.016
a pretty serious
relationship with his mom.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.144
I lived with her to save money.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.520
Yeah, you didn't have
to buy groceries

12:52.646 --> 12:53.926
because you were breast-feeding.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.389
So I guess if it weren't for me,

12:58.486 --> 12:59.652
you'd still be living with her, huh?

12:59.779 --> 13:01.654
Not exactly.

13:01.781 --> 13:02.981
What do you mean, not exactly?

13:03.032 --> 13:05.825
Well, things would be
a little different.

13:06.285 --> 13:10.872
Howard, where's my lunch? I'm starving!

13:12.416 --> 13:15.543
I know you're starving.
The neighbors know you're starving.

13:15.669 --> 13:18.671
There's starving people in Africa
who know you're starving!

13:20.841 --> 13:23.384
That's it?
There's not enough food!

13:23.552 --> 13:27.222
Well, you cleaned out Earth!
I don't know what else to do!

13:29.225 --> 13:30.975
How is this any different?

13:31.101 --> 13:32.894
You didn't let me finish.

13:33.562 --> 13:35.396
Here you go, Mother.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.441
You're a good boy, Howard!

13:38.567 --> 13:42.403
Such a good boy!

13:47.201 --> 13:49.577
Wait, did she die
or did you kill her?

13:52.748 --> 13:55.333
Tomato, tomahto.
The important thing is she's dead.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.963
Hey, so how come you two
didn't move in together?

14:00.089 --> 14:01.714
This guy wanted
a place of his own

14:01.841 --> 14:04.133
because he was sure he was
gonna be a ladies' man.

14:06.053 --> 14:07.762
Yeah, I was wrong.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.558
But I do think you and I
would have had a great time.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.435
Come on, Leonard, dinner.

14:14.603 --> 14:16.521
Coming.

14:25.281 --> 14:26.281
Hang on.

14:26.490 --> 14:28.199
Why would I be fat?

14:29.285 --> 14:31.536
You'd have no girlfriend
to see you naked,

14:31.662 --> 14:34.289
you'd try to fill the void
with food,

14:34.415 --> 14:37.166
and I'm an enabler who once
deep-fried a pancake.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.878
Why can't you be fat too?

14:41.922 --> 14:43.548
What do you want
to do for dessert?

14:46.677 --> 14:49.095
I think there's still
half a cake from breakfast.

14:51.599 --> 14:52.724
No, there's not.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.480
Hey, guys.

15:01.483 --> 15:03.151
Stuart!

15:03.819 --> 15:05.278
What are you doing?

15:05.404 --> 15:07.155
I...

15:07.281 --> 15:10.491
...just wanted to be
in anyone's story.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.621
Yeah, but why are you fat?

15:17.166 --> 15:19.000
Because Leonard was fat.

15:21.503 --> 15:23.004
Amy, what about you?

15:23.172 --> 15:25.214
What do you think you'd be doing
if you never met Sheldon?

15:25.341 --> 15:27.342
It's hard to say,

15:27.509 --> 15:29.594
my life would be so... different.

15:30.179 --> 15:32.847
You can say "better."
Sheldon can't hear you.

15:34.683 --> 15:36.059
I don't know.

15:47.529 --> 15:51.699
в™Є There's tears in the frosting в™Є

16:11.929 --> 16:13.596
I'll stop now.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.559
How's it going, Sheldon?

16:18.727 --> 16:19.727
That's it.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.145
The baby's here.

16:21.897 --> 16:22.897
It's a boy.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.691
Congrats.

16:24.775 --> 16:26.401
Oh, thank you.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.820
I wasn't sure I was
going to make it.

16:30.489 --> 16:33.116
But my mother
gave me some ice chips,

16:33.242 --> 16:35.410
my sister told me to breathe.

16:35.577 --> 16:37.412
And I just thought
to myself, "Sheldon,

16:37.538 --> 16:39.580
if you can make it through
the Green Lantern movie,

16:39.707 --> 16:41.457
you can make it through this."

16:42.626 --> 16:44.085
Well, good for you, buddy.

16:44.253 --> 16:45.586
We'll let you get back in there.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.422
No, no, I'm not
going back in there.

16:47.631 --> 16:49.298
That baby is so irritating.

16:50.050 --> 16:52.969
He has literally been crying
his entire life.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.306
Oh, he's already taking
after Uncle Shelly.

16:58.976 --> 17:01.477
- Come on, Sheldon, you should go.
- Why?

17:02.104 --> 17:03.896
Well, you always
complain that you never

17:04.023 --> 17:05.940
had an intelligent
role model growing up,

17:06.108 --> 17:07.775
and now you can
be one for your nephew.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.113
All right, I'll go.

17:13.365 --> 17:15.408
But from what I've seen,
his attention span

17:15.534 --> 17:17.410
is as limited as his bladder control.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.122
You actually got him to do it.

17:21.248 --> 17:24.042
Yeah, you keep saying how much
Sheldon has affected all of us,

17:24.168 --> 17:26.419
but you've clearly
had an impact on him.

17:27.129 --> 17:29.169
If that were true,
I wouldn't still be living alone.

17:29.965 --> 17:31.299
Well, not exactly alone.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.634
I do have a 50 pound sack of rice

17:33.761 --> 17:35.553
with one of Sheldon's T-shirts on it.

17:39.224 --> 17:42.101
I'm telling you, Sheldon cares
for you more than you think.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.854
I wish I could believe you.

17:44.980 --> 17:47.690
I also wish there wasn't a mouse
living in Rice Sheldon.

17:50.652 --> 17:53.821
Hang on, I'm gonna give you a little
early Christmas present.

17:54.823 --> 17:57.283
I'm gonna show you something,
but if you ever told Sheldon,

17:57.409 --> 17:59.285
he'd probably never
speak to me again.

17:59.453 --> 18:01.329
So, if you want to tell him,
that's fine.

18:02.956 --> 18:03.998
Look.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.503
I don't understand.

18:09.171 --> 18:10.546
He made you his screensaver.

18:12.341 --> 18:13.341
Oh.

18:14.009 --> 18:15.551
Wow.

18:15.677 --> 18:17.428
I had no idea.

18:18.847 --> 18:20.848
He is so into me.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.228
Wait, wait, where'd I go?

18:25.896 --> 18:28.147
Oh, well, it's you, Swamp Thing,

18:28.273 --> 18:31.192
Stephen Hawking, Spider-Man...
but, look, you're in the mix.

18:32.486 --> 18:35.238
I am in the mix.
And I'm the hottest one.

18:36.031 --> 18:37.198
Who's that?

18:37.324 --> 18:40.243
- Oh, Madame Curie.
- That's fine, she's dead.

18:54.091 --> 18:55.424
You okay?

18:56.343 --> 18:58.427
Just really glad you're back.

18:58.637 --> 18:59.637
Me, too.

19:01.390 --> 19:03.141
I got a lot of TV to catch up on.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.065
I missed you.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.277
To quote Han Solo, "I know."

19:18.907 --> 19:20.992
Did you miss me?

19:21.118 --> 19:23.452
I would've preferred
to have you there with me.

19:23.579 --> 19:24.579
Oh...

19:25.038 --> 19:26.414
Or instead of me.

19:29.918 --> 19:31.794
Did you hold the baby?

19:31.920 --> 19:33.880
- I did.
- And?

19:34.673 --> 19:36.883
How did it make you feel?

19:37.009 --> 19:39.594
Looking into the blank, innocent eyes

19:39.678 --> 19:43.139
of a creature that couldn't begin to
comprehend anything I was saying?

19:43.557 --> 19:45.808
Basically just another day
at the office.

19:52.399 --> 19:54.275
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna ask her out.

19:57.988 --> 20:00.865
Yeah, and chocolate milk is
gonna squirt out of my nipples.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.993
Put up or shut up.
You make it, I'll drink it.

20:09.333 --> 20:10.625
You guys need anything else?

20:10.751 --> 20:12.835
Your phone number
and one more cheesecake.

20:15.797 --> 20:17.298
I'm sorry, I have a boyfriend.

20:17.424 --> 20:20.218
In fact, there he is now.

20:29.186 --> 20:30.478
Ready to go, sweetheart?

20:30.604 --> 20:32.063
Not until I get my kiss.
