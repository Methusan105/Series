00:04.110 --> 00:07.080
I've invented a science joke, would you like to hear it?

00:07.080 --> 00:08.270
Sure.

00:08.270 --> 00:12.190
How many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?

00:12.190 --> 00:13.340
How many?

00:13.340 --> 00:15.300
Who cares? He stole the idea

00:15.300 --> 00:17.840
and doesn't deserve his own joke.

00:17.840 --> 00:19.400
Is that really true?

00:19.400 --> 00:22.110
Of course, that's how you know it's a good joke.

00:22.110 --> 00:25.110
It not only entertains, it informs.

00:26.490 --> 00:27.940
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

00:27.940 --> 00:29.120
Uh, Barry,

00:29.120 --> 00:32.130
uh, how many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?

00:32.130 --> 00:35.560
Did you know Edison didn't actually invent the light bulb?

00:37.960 --> 00:40.290
What do you want, Barry?

00:40.290 --> 00:43.290
Just wanted to drop this off as a little thank you for Amy.

00:43.300 --> 00:44.630
What's this for?

00:44.630 --> 00:46.430
Your idea really helped me out.

00:46.430 --> 00:49.070
My light-cone quantization paper's online already.

00:49.070 --> 00:51.570
The response has been amazing.

00:51.570 --> 00:52.660
Well, that's fascinating.

00:52.660 --> 00:54.040
I can't wait to read it.

00:54.040 --> 00:55.580
Oh, no, me as well.

00:55.580 --> 00:59.960
Uh, please e-mail it to sheldon@bazinga.biz.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.130
Why "Dot-biz"?

01:01.130 --> 01:03.430
Because I just gave you the business.

01:03.430 --> 01:07.100
And also bazinga.com was taken.

01:07.670 --> 01:09.620
Anyway, thanks again.

01:09.620 --> 01:12.040
Cooper, suck eggs.

01:13.810 --> 01:16.090
Since when do you help out Barry Kripke?

01:16.090 --> 01:18.470
Well, I'd been thinking about a cellular automata approach

01:18.470 --> 01:19.670
to neuronal connectivity,

01:19.670 --> 01:21.520
and I thought it might have some interesting applications

01:21.520 --> 01:23.940
to string theory-- it's not a big deal.

01:23.940 --> 01:25.350
Oh, really?

01:25.350 --> 01:27.890
When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end,

01:27.890 --> 01:29.560
why didn't you try to help me?

01:29.560 --> 01:32.600
I did-- you said the only math biologists know is

01:32.600 --> 01:34.700
if you have three frogs and one hops away,

01:34.700 --> 01:37.430
that leaves two frogs.

01:37.810 --> 01:40.610
That's pretty funny, that does sound like me.

01:40.610 --> 01:41.540
But that doesn't mean

01:41.540 --> 01:43.340
that you should be standing on street corners

01:43.340 --> 01:46.970
handing out your math to whatever guy comes along.

01:47.990 --> 01:49.750
Sheldon, we're all scientists.

01:49.750 --> 01:51.520
I helped out a fellow colleague.

01:51.520 --> 01:52.890
You're being petty.

01:52.890 --> 01:54.530
I'm being petty?

01:54.530 --> 01:57.520
You know Barry and I have a professional rivalry.

01:57.520 --> 01:59.930
You heard him-- he told me to suck eggs.

01:59.930 --> 02:01.830
If we were friends, he would have suggested

02:01.830 --> 02:03.890
I suck something more pleasant.

02:06.290 --> 02:08.330
Why are you laughing?

02:08.330 --> 02:10.440
Did you learn something?

02:36.670 --> 02:37.590
Okay, Ma.

02:37.590 --> 02:39.220
Say hi to Aunt Gladys.

02:39.220 --> 02:40.490
Yeah, I love you, too.

02:40.490 --> 02:41.830
Bye.

02:41.830 --> 02:43.440
Your mom having fun in Florida?

02:43.440 --> 02:44.660
Mmm, she loves it.

02:44.660 --> 02:46.640
She finally found a place where everyone talks about

02:46.640 --> 02:48.850
how sweaty they are.

02:49.320 --> 02:50.930
Anyway, she wants us to go to the house

02:50.930 --> 02:54.560
and check in on Stuart because he might be "lonely."

02:54.560 --> 02:55.920
She's just being nice.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.800
Well, I'm her son, how come she doesn't send someone

02:57.800 --> 03:00.030
to check on me if I'm lonely?

03:00.030 --> 03:02.170
Because you have a wife.

03:04.850 --> 03:08.110
Yeah, well, sometimes you work late.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.820
I know you don't like Stuart being in the house,

03:10.820 --> 03:12.130
but the store's about to reopen,

03:12.130 --> 03:13.810
I'm sure he'll get back on his feet.

03:13.810 --> 03:14.560
That would be great.

03:14.560 --> 03:17.910
I'd love for things between me and Mom to get back to normal.

03:17.910 --> 03:21.610
Well, normal's a strong word, but sure.

03:25.530 --> 03:27.930
- Hey. - Hello.

03:28.700 --> 03:29.730
You okay?

03:29.730 --> 03:31.640
If I was okay, I would've said "Hello"

03:31.640 --> 03:34.310
and not the much more ominous "Hello."

03:35.160 --> 03:36.290
What's going on?

03:36.290 --> 03:38.100
I'm mad at Amy.

03:38.100 --> 03:42.030
Did she leave pit stains in your favorite crop top, too?

03:42.320 --> 03:44.020
No.

03:44.510 --> 03:47.960
She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory.

03:47.960 --> 03:50.030
Oh, that sounds like a good thing.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.990
Well, it would be, except that I left string theory

03:52.990 --> 03:54.990
because I decided it was a dead end.

03:54.990 --> 03:56.890
Yeah, and then she went behind my back

03:56.890 --> 03:58.790
to help someone else prove me wrong.

03:58.790 --> 04:01.040
My rival, no less.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.330
I'm sorry you had to see that.

04:14.860 --> 04:17.760
I'm sorry I didn't have a camera.

04:17.760 --> 04:19.670
Why would she do this to me?

04:19.670 --> 04:22.360
Well, I'm sure she didn't upset you on purpose.

04:22.360 --> 04:23.700
Besides, aren't you the one who says

04:23.700 --> 04:26.780
there's nothing more important than the advancement of science?

04:26.780 --> 04:28.840
No, I said there's nothing more important

04:28.840 --> 04:31.760
than me advancing science.

04:31.760 --> 04:33.300
All right, well, if I'm understanding this right,

04:33.300 --> 04:35.690
and all she did was help out another scientist,

04:35.690 --> 04:38.700
I'm thinking you might have to let this one go.

04:38.700 --> 04:40.300
Ugh, "Let it go."

04:40.300 --> 04:42.010
I have heard that my whole life.

04:42.010 --> 04:44.790
Every time something upsets me somebody says, "Let it go,"

04:44.790 --> 04:46.190
you know, like it's my fault,

04:46.190 --> 04:48.470
and it's not okay to feel the way I feel.

04:48.470 --> 04:49.690
I don't know what to tell you.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.280
I mean, why don't you talk to her?

04:51.920 --> 04:53.260
Is that all you have?

04:53.260 --> 04:56.370
Shopworn tidbits like "talk to her" and "let it go"?

04:56.370 --> 04:58.450
Gee, Penny, life's giving me lemons.

04:58.450 --> 04:59.520
What should I do?

04:59.520 --> 05:02.160
Well, you could shove them somewhere.

05:04.080 --> 05:06.570
Okay, now you're getting creative.

05:08.320 --> 05:09.760
Thanks again for your help.

05:09.760 --> 05:10.800
- No problem. - Our pleasure.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.130
The place really looks great.

05:12.130 --> 05:14.730
Yeah, you should have burned it down years ago.

05:15.720 --> 05:17.960
I keep telling you I didn't burn it down.

05:17.960 --> 05:19.520
We know, we know-- because burning something down

05:19.520 --> 05:23.060
for the insurance money is a "crime."

05:24.570 --> 05:26.940
Stuart, this place looks amazing.

05:26.940 --> 05:27.960
Thanks.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.710
You really did a nice job.

05:29.710 --> 05:32.490
And thank you for putting up with me

05:32.490 --> 05:34.150
staying at your mom's through all this.

05:34.150 --> 05:36.330
I-I couldn't have done it otherwise.

05:36.330 --> 05:39.650
I appreciate that, and I'm glad you were able to...

05:40.950 --> 05:42.990
Is that my mother's furniture?

05:45.060 --> 05:46.530
Yeah, she said I could use it.

05:46.530 --> 05:48.170
Doesn't it look great?

05:48.170 --> 05:52.430
Not as great as it looks in the den where it belongs.

05:52.430 --> 05:53.160
Howie.

05:53.160 --> 05:55.750
Why don't you just clean out the whole room?

05:55.750 --> 05:58.320
Take the string art clown I made her in third grade

05:58.320 --> 05:59.500
and the ribbon I got in swim class

05:59.500 --> 06:01.700
for putting my face in the water.

06:01.700 --> 06:03.030
What is your problem?

06:03.030 --> 06:04.240
She said it was okay.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.880
Well, I'm her son, and I say it's not okay.

06:06.880 --> 06:11.400
Some son-- looks like you spent ten minutes on that clown art.

06:12.300 --> 06:14.160
Well, maybe I should've gone to a fancy art school like you.

06:14.160 --> 06:15.700
Then I could run a failed comic shop

06:15.700 --> 06:18.090
and mooch off some guy's mother.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.770
Why don't we leave so you can cool off?

06:20.770 --> 06:22.510
I think that's a good idea.

06:22.510 --> 06:23.680
Take him out of my store.

06:23.680 --> 06:24.460
Your store?!

06:24.460 --> 06:26.410
My mother gave you the money to reopen.

06:26.410 --> 06:27.750
I'm not going anywhere.

06:27.750 --> 06:30.210
Why don't we go get the food for the party.

06:30.210 --> 06:31.300
Thank you.

06:31.300 --> 06:33.660
Smart-- looks like we're being helpful.

06:33.660 --> 06:37.270
Mmm, when really we're just exiting an uncomfortable situation.

06:40.030 --> 06:42.650
Kripke, you know, of all the people-- Barry Kripke.

06:42.650 --> 06:44.640
I'm so... Are you folding it like a crazy person

06:44.640 --> 06:46.650
to get me to do it for you?!

06:47.810 --> 06:49.030
No.

06:50.940 --> 06:52.580
Oh, give me that.

06:58.180 --> 07:00.350
Just out of curiosity,

07:00.350 --> 07:03.320
if I were to let something go,

07:03.320 --> 07:04.930
how would I do that?

07:04.930 --> 07:07.740
I don't know-- just think about something else.

07:08.810 --> 07:11.010
Can I think about the spiny anteater?

07:11.010 --> 07:12.130
Sure.

07:12.630 --> 07:14.870
The spiny anteater...

07:14.870 --> 07:18.150
never went behind my back and worked with Barry Kripke.

07:19.780 --> 07:22.350
That didn't help at all.

07:22.830 --> 07:25.510
You know, some people try visualization.

07:25.510 --> 07:27.140
How does that work?

07:28.490 --> 07:29.670
Okay,

07:30.990 --> 07:33.940
imagine your problems are a pen.

07:35.690 --> 07:36.540
Okay.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.690
Now imagine you're holding that pen.

07:44.300 --> 07:45.930
Okay.

07:45.930 --> 07:49.190
Now open your hand and let it go.

07:49.190 --> 07:51.260
But I just got this pen.

07:52.410 --> 07:55.180
It's got my initials on it and everything.

07:55.180 --> 07:56.690
Look.

07:58.990 --> 08:01.640
Sheldon, this isn't that hard.

08:03.760 --> 08:06.040
I may have a better way that you can teach me.

08:06.040 --> 08:07.210
How?

08:07.850 --> 08:10.970
What if I told you that over the past few months

08:10.970 --> 08:13.880
Amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles

08:13.880 --> 08:18.060
to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab?

08:19.420 --> 08:21.430
What? She didn't give me any puzzles.

08:21.430 --> 08:23.430
Are you sure?

08:25.850 --> 08:29.380
Boy, I just can't seem to get these scissors back together.

08:29.380 --> 08:31.050
Can you do it?

08:33.110 --> 08:33.990
Darn it.

08:33.990 --> 08:35.960
There's something in my eye,

08:35.960 --> 08:38.740
and I need to sort these coins by size.

08:38.740 --> 08:40.310
Can you help?

08:46.510 --> 08:47.330
Penny?

08:48.090 --> 08:49.930
I really want to eat this banana,

08:49.930 --> 08:53.910
but it's stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box.

08:55.690 --> 08:58.180
Son of a bitch!

08:58.850 --> 08:59.830
Okay, that's great.

08:59.830 --> 09:03.800
Now, let it go.

09:07.330 --> 09:10.340
I can't believe you were testing me against a chimp!

09:10.340 --> 09:12.900
Well, excuse me, Amy was testing you.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.640
I was rooting for you.

09:16.600 --> 09:19.740
Good job on that banana box, by the way.

09:20.330 --> 09:22.240
Why would she even do this?

09:22.240 --> 09:24.460
She's been conducting an experiment on apes

09:24.460 --> 09:26.710
where they're given various puzzles to solve.

09:26.710 --> 09:29.350
I was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles

09:29.350 --> 09:31.580
and thought some humans wouldn't be able to solve them.

09:31.580 --> 09:34.900
That's when Amy said, "Want to make this interesting?"

09:35.990 --> 09:37.470
"Make this interesting"?

09:37.470 --> 09:38.990
You bet money on me?

09:38.990 --> 09:40.250
No, no.

09:40.250 --> 09:42.950
We designed an experiment involving you.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.320
See? Now, isn't that interesting?

09:46.420 --> 09:47.820
It's not interesting.

09:47.820 --> 09:49.650
It's incredibly insulting.

09:49.650 --> 09:51.990
Okay, maybe this will help--

09:51.990 --> 09:54.740
imagine you're holding a pen.

09:55.960 --> 09:58.850
Before you go too far, not a special pen

09:58.850 --> 10:00.410
with your initials engraved on it--

10:00.410 --> 10:01.780
that'll make the next part really hard.

10:03.120 --> 10:03.800
That's it.

10:03.800 --> 10:04.840
Get out!

10:04.840 --> 10:07.000
I don't understand why you're mad at me.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.570
You should be mad at Amy.

10:08.570 --> 10:10.570
Like I was this afternoon.

10:10.570 --> 10:12.660
Hey, look at that-- I let it go.

10:12.660 --> 10:13.750
Get out!

10:16.620 --> 10:18.520
- Penny? - What?

10:18.980 --> 10:21.020
I think I left my pen in there.

10:24.590 --> 10:26.190
I understand why you're upset,

10:26.190 --> 10:28.620
but he worked really hard to get the store ready.

10:28.620 --> 10:31.100
And it's just furniture.

10:31.100 --> 10:32.890
It's my mom's furniture.

10:32.890 --> 10:34.540
It belongs in the house I grew up in--

10:34.540 --> 10:36.310
next to that pile of TV Guides

10:36.310 --> 10:39.040
and in plain view of what, for a ten-year-old,

10:39.040 --> 10:41.340
was a quality piece of string art!

10:44.320 --> 10:45.930
Howie, if the store succeeds,

10:45.930 --> 10:47.300
Stuart has a source of income,

10:47.300 --> 10:49.230
and he can move out of your mother's house.

10:49.230 --> 10:51.200
Seems like some old furniture is a reasonable price

10:51.200 --> 10:53.050
to pay for that.

10:53.690 --> 10:54.930
That is a good point.

10:54.930 --> 10:56.400
But I didn't marry you for good points.

10:56.400 --> 10:57.630
I married you to blindly support me

10:57.630 --> 11:00.290
no matter how ridiculous I'm being!

11:02.070 --> 11:05.180
This is why I had to rewrite our wedding vows.

11:09.690 --> 11:11.990
Hi, we're here to pick up an order for Comic Center.

11:11.990 --> 11:14.280
Sure, let me go check on that.

11:15.270 --> 11:19.020
Dude, I-I think that's Nathan Fillion.

11:19.510 --> 11:21.990
Oh yeah, look at that.

11:21.990 --> 11:24.040
And he's picking the tomatoes out of his salad

11:24.040 --> 11:25.750
just like I do.

11:26.260 --> 11:28.560
I always did feel a connection with him.

11:30.410 --> 11:31.720
Oh, I have got an idea.

11:31.720 --> 11:35.180
We're not selling his tomatoes on eBay.

11:35.180 --> 11:39.000
No, if we got Captain Reynolds from Firefly

11:39.000 --> 11:41.200
to do a signing at Stuart's store,

11:41.200 --> 11:42.680
that would be amazing.

11:42.680 --> 11:44.140
That would be great.

11:44.140 --> 11:46.060
So should we go talk to him?

11:46.060 --> 11:47.310
I don't know.

11:47.310 --> 11:49.620
I mean, if he's not nice, it's gonna make it hard for me

11:49.620 --> 11:52.030
- to watch him in anything again. - What?!

11:52.030 --> 11:54.770
The-the guy who plays Jon Snow was a jerk.

11:54.770 --> 11:56.290
We still watch Game of Thrones.

11:56.290 --> 11:59.190
He was a jerk because you rear-ended him.

11:59.900 --> 12:01.540
I was distracted.

12:01.540 --> 12:03.580
It's weird seeing a member of the Night's Watch

12:03.580 --> 12:05.380
with a kayak strapped to his car.

12:07.280 --> 12:08.210
Come on.

12:12.690 --> 12:13.960
Hi, excuse me, s-s...

12:13.960 --> 12:15.430
I-I don't mean to bother you,

12:15.430 --> 12:18.370
but we're just really big fans of Firefly.

12:18.370 --> 12:20.180
A-And Dr. Horrible.

12:20.180 --> 12:22.160
Oh, uh, I think you made a mistake.

12:22.160 --> 12:23.810
I'm not an actor.

12:23.810 --> 12:25.710
Don't say that.

12:25.710 --> 12:27.240
I mean, you're not Dame Judi Dench,

12:27.240 --> 12:29.190
but you're pretty great.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.530
Oh, yeah, I get it-- you think I'm Nathan Fillion,

12:34.530 --> 12:35.420
but I'm not.

12:35.420 --> 12:39.010
So if you don't mind, I would just love to eat my lunch.

12:39.460 --> 12:40.320
Come on.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.140
Sorry to bother you.

12:42.140 --> 12:44.600
Don't know why he's so grumpy.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.630
I got mistaken for that guy in Life of Pi once,

12:46.630 --> 12:49.240
and I'm still floating.

12:52.260 --> 12:54.010
Sheldon, it's me.

12:54.010 --> 12:55.290
Oh, hey.

12:55.290 --> 12:57.250
D-Did you see that?

12:57.250 --> 13:01.640
I-I figured out how to open the door all by myself.

13:02.800 --> 13:07.310
Maybe I'll fling some feces around my cage to celebrate.

13:08.190 --> 13:09.660
What are you talking about?

13:09.660 --> 13:12.800
I know you've been giving me secret puzzle tests.

13:15.160 --> 13:16.830
Sheldon, open the door.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.490
I can't.

13:18.500 --> 13:20.800
I'm naked.

13:21.490 --> 13:23.640
I just saw you.

13:23.640 --> 13:25.560
Hang on.

13:26.250 --> 13:28.550
Open the door now.

13:28.550 --> 13:30.960
Pull up your pants!

13:33.290 --> 13:34.830
It's not a big deal.

13:34.830 --> 13:37.690
I run tests like this on undergrads all the time.

13:37.690 --> 13:39.420
If you fill out some paperwork at the university,

13:39.420 --> 13:41.720
I can get you $5.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.390
I don't want $5.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.570
I want my dignity.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.350
So what are we talking, like, ten bucks?

13:50.460 --> 13:52.550
- Thank you. - Thanks.

13:54.430 --> 13:56.330
- Sorry again. - No problem.

13:56.780 --> 13:58.990
A-Are you sure you're not him?

13:58.990 --> 14:00.290
Uh, you can tell us.

14:00.290 --> 14:03.590
We're scientists, not crazy fanboys.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.560
All right, fine.

14:06.560 --> 14:08.070
I'm him.

14:08.070 --> 14:11.380
And you're eating alone at a deli.

14:11.380 --> 14:13.930
I don't buy it-- you're not him.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.750
I just wanted to eat my lunch in peace.

14:16.750 --> 14:17.920
But I really am him.

14:17.920 --> 14:20.020
And thank you very much for being a fan.

14:20.020 --> 14:21.860
If you want, uh, let's take a picture.

14:22.340 --> 14:23.380
- That would be great. - Great.

14:23.380 --> 14:25.330
- Yeah, thank you. - You bet.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.690
Wait, hang on.

14:31.920 --> 14:34.280
If you're really Nathan Fillion,

14:34.280 --> 14:37.610
what's the line from Firefly about your bonnet?

14:38.440 --> 14:41.580
"I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, I will end you."

14:42.990 --> 14:44.900
That's it, that's the line.

14:44.900 --> 14:46.330
Although...

14:46.330 --> 14:49.760
I knew the line-- doesn't make me Nathan Fillion.

14:51.060 --> 14:52.560
Do you want the picture or not?

14:52.560 --> 14:55.440
I want a picture with Nathan Fillion.

14:56.370 --> 14:58.650
How about a picture with a guy who looks like Nathan Fillion

14:58.650 --> 15:02.140
but a little more annoyed than Nathan Fillion usually is?

15:04.660 --> 15:06.250
What do you think?

15:06.900 --> 15:09.030
Eh, it's good enough for Facebook.

15:16.250 --> 15:17.810
I can't believe they did that.

15:17.820 --> 15:19.820
I know-- it's so insulting.

15:19.820 --> 15:21.510
At one point, they had me figure out

15:21.510 --> 15:24.860
how to get a banana out of a puzzle box.

15:24.860 --> 15:27.460
Wait, Sheldon gave me a banana in a box.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.660
He was testing me, too.

15:30.400 --> 15:31.590
Unbelievable.

15:31.590 --> 15:33.580
And how could a chimp even solve that?

15:33.580 --> 15:35.220
That was impossible.

15:35.220 --> 15:37.830
Really? You couldn't get it out?

15:40.970 --> 15:42.310
Thank you.

15:42.310 --> 15:44.310
Wow, the store looks great.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.310
So you guys were testing us both?

15:46.310 --> 15:47.340
What is the matter with you?

15:47.350 --> 15:48.860
Eh, what's the matter with them is

15:48.860 --> 15:50.450
they think they're so smart they don't care

15:50.450 --> 15:52.110
if they hurt other people's feelings.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.370
- Sounds like us. - That's not true.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.120
I still don't understand why you're upset.

15:59.120 --> 16:02.120
You solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps.

16:02.130 --> 16:05.280
Well, except Barnabas, but he was on Adderall.

16:06.950 --> 16:08.940
I'm sorry, but it's making me crazy.

16:08.940 --> 16:11.100
Can you please just let it go?

16:11.100 --> 16:13.390
Oh, I can help you with that.

16:14.360 --> 16:17.870
Imagine you're holding an ordinary pen.

16:18.680 --> 16:22.920
While your favorite pen is safe and secure in your pocket.

16:25.110 --> 16:26.140
Hold that thought.

16:26.950 --> 16:27.990
Hello?

16:27.990 --> 16:30.130
How can I make this up to you?

16:30.130 --> 16:32.240
The answer's in this puzzle box.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.820
Let's see if you can open it.

16:38.240 --> 16:40.590
You could have at least warned him about the furniture.

16:40.590 --> 16:42.620
That's what I said when we moved it.

16:42.620 --> 16:44.060
You helped him?!

16:44.060 --> 16:47.530
No, Stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own.

16:51.390 --> 16:53.180
Hey, you okay?

16:53.870 --> 16:55.000
Uh, no.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.230
What's wrong?

16:57.980 --> 17:00.420
My mom died.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.010
What?

17:04.760 --> 17:07.630
That was my aunt.

17:07.630 --> 17:09.750
Ma took a nap.

17:10.440 --> 17:12.790
She never woke up.

17:13.360 --> 17:15.910
Oh, my God, Howie.

17:18.050 --> 17:19.870
I'm so sorry.

17:20.880 --> 17:22.390
What can we do?

17:24.950 --> 17:26.940
I don't know.

17:31.830 --> 17:33.060
May I say something?

17:33.060 --> 17:34.390
Not right now, Sheldon.

17:34.390 --> 17:35.990
- But I think it would be comforting. - Buddy...

17:35.990 --> 17:37.930
No, it's okay.

17:38.310 --> 17:40.080
What?

17:40.450 --> 17:43.120
When I lost my own father,

17:43.120 --> 17:45.880
I didn't have any friends to help me through it.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.750
You do.

17:54.510 --> 17:58.270
I really thought he was gonna say, "let it go."

18:05.180 --> 18:06.750
Okay, thanks, Bernadette.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.730
Travel safe.

18:08.810 --> 18:10.720
Okay, bye.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.000
They booked a flight.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.750
They're heading to the airport now.

18:14.750 --> 18:16.420
How's Howard holding up?

18:16.420 --> 18:17.900
He's hanging in there.

18:17.900 --> 18:20.390
How are you doing, Stuart?

18:21.250 --> 18:22.680
Still can't believe she's gone.

18:22.680 --> 18:25.440
I mean, that woman took me in.

18:25.440 --> 18:28.470
If it wasn't for her, I-I would have been homeless.

18:28.470 --> 18:30.310
One of us would have taken you in.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.960
Yeah, I don't recall any offers.

18:34.050 --> 18:36.980
But, you know, uh, I-I'm glad it worked out the way it did

18:36.980 --> 18:41.370
because I got to know this wonderful person.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.770
Yeah.

18:42.770 --> 18:44.950
Mrs. Wolowitz was pretty special.

18:44.950 --> 18:46.900
When I first moved to America,

18:46.900 --> 18:49.430
Howard was my only friend.

18:49.430 --> 18:52.670
She made me feel so welcome in her home.

18:52.670 --> 18:55.670
Which says a lot, because, those first few years,

18:55.670 --> 18:57.910
she thought I was the gardener.

19:00.190 --> 19:01.110
Whenever I saw her,

19:01.110 --> 19:05.120
she'd say I was too skinny and try and feed me.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.700
She did that to me, too.

19:07.700 --> 19:10.370
Don't take this away from me.

19:11.530 --> 19:13.940
I didn't care for her yelling.

19:14.410 --> 19:16.940
But now that I'm not going to hear it again,

19:16.940 --> 19:18.570
I'm sad.

19:18.570 --> 19:21.250
If you want, I can yell at you later.

19:23.100 --> 19:25.150
It won't be as good.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.010
Let's have a toast.

19:30.940 --> 19:33.150
To Mrs. Wolowitz.

19:33.670 --> 19:35.510
A loving mother...

19:38.120 --> 19:40.430
...to all of us.

19:41.650 --> 19:43.370
We'll miss you.
