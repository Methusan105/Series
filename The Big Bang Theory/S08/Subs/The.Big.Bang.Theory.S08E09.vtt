00:03.630 --> 00:04.920
This is an easy one.

00:04.920 --> 00:06.560
You love this guy.

00:06.560 --> 00:07.830
Me.

00:09.340 --> 00:12.890
Come on. He's an underappreciated genius.

00:12.890 --> 00:14.880
Still think it's me.

00:15.640 --> 00:16.920
It's not you.

00:16.920 --> 00:19.600
Now think, there's a car named after him.

00:19.600 --> 00:20.920
Of course there is.

00:20.920 --> 00:24.460
The Mini Cooper 'cause it's me.

00:25.310 --> 00:27.010
How about this:

00:27.010 --> 00:29.150
he's a poor man's Sheldon Cooper.

00:29.150 --> 00:30.700
Oh, Tesla.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.600
- How'd it go? - Oh, not fun.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.260
The doctor shoved a camera up into my sinuses.

00:37.260 --> 00:38.130
Yeah, I watched.

00:38.130 --> 00:42.200
It was like the scary boat tunnel in Willy Wonka.

00:42.870 --> 00:44.230
- Did they figure out what's wrong? - Yeah.

00:44.230 --> 00:45.870
It's a deviated septum.

00:45.870 --> 00:47.260
The surgery to correct it is simple.

00:47.260 --> 00:48.440
He's gonna do it next week.

00:48.440 --> 00:50.250
Why would you have surgery?

00:50.250 --> 00:51.970
Because I can't breathe.

00:51.970 --> 00:54.290
I snore, I get sinus infections...

00:54.290 --> 00:57.130
Yeah, back off, he's all mine.

00:57.130 --> 00:59.190
But you don't have a life-threatening condition.

00:59.190 --> 01:01.070
Why would you take the risk of surgery?

01:01.070 --> 01:02.880
Sheldon, it's a routine procedure.

01:02.880 --> 01:04.890
I've heard you complain about his snoring.

01:04.890 --> 01:07.180
We... Yes, for the first five or six years,

01:07.180 --> 01:09.230
but I've gotten used to it.

01:09.230 --> 01:11.040
It helps me sleep.

01:11.040 --> 01:14.930
He's like my mucus-powered white noise machine.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.240
Sheldon, I'm gonna get the surgery, it's no big deal.

01:17.240 --> 01:18.150
End of story.

01:18.150 --> 01:20.030
Very well. I'm done talking about it.

01:20.030 --> 01:20.620
Thank you.

01:20.620 --> 01:22.180
I believe it was your turn in the game.

01:22.180 --> 01:23.260
Okay.

01:24.950 --> 01:26.210
Let's see...

01:26.210 --> 01:28.820
Oh, this person is most famous

01:28.820 --> 01:32.840
for never having gotten his nose mutilated with elective surgery

01:32.850 --> 01:35.690
and never living the rest of his life in the shadows

01:35.690 --> 01:38.370
as a hideous, disfigured freak.

01:39.070 --> 01:40.830
I think you could give a better clue.

01:40.830 --> 01:41.920
I don't.

01:42.380 --> 01:45.050
I'm not even sure if that's a person or a typo.

02:25.550 --> 02:27.780
Okay, why?

02:28.520 --> 02:30.740
I'm listening to you snore.

02:31.150 --> 02:33.810
I'm wondering how I'll ever sleep without it.

02:34.850 --> 02:36.250
If it helps you sleep,

02:36.250 --> 02:38.300
then why are you sitting here staring at me

02:38.300 --> 02:41.490
like the albino boogeyman?

02:42.180 --> 02:43.870
Really, Leonard-- insults?

02:43.870 --> 02:45.550
After I spent two hours in your closet,

02:45.550 --> 02:47.660
waiting for you to fall asleep?

02:50.200 --> 02:51.870
What's your problem?

02:51.870 --> 02:55.500
If the surgery is successful, the snoring is gone.

02:55.500 --> 02:58.260
And if you die during surgery...

02:59.110 --> 03:01.320
...the snoring is gone.

03:02.520 --> 03:05.780
It sounds like either way, I finally get some rest.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.710
I have to be honest with you Leonard,

03:07.710 --> 03:09.460
I'm truly worried.

03:09.460 --> 03:12.170
I-I told you, there's nothing to worry about.

03:12.170 --> 03:13.870
Well, I've been doing some research

03:13.870 --> 03:16.460
and I've learned that one in 700,000 people

03:16.460 --> 03:18.970
die from general anesthesia.

03:18.970 --> 03:21.320
Buddy, w... Do you realize that that also means

03:21.320 --> 03:26.380
699,999 people don't die?

03:27.470 --> 03:29.570
I suppose that's true.

03:30.760 --> 03:34.090
You're such a glass half-full kind of guy.

03:35.250 --> 03:37.210
I'm going to miss that.

03:40.370 --> 03:43.290
Oh, so, my, uh, parents' 40th anniversary's coming up

03:43.290 --> 03:45.840
and I can't think of a thing to get them.

03:45.840 --> 03:47.160
Damn, can you imagine

03:47.160 --> 03:50.710
being married to someone for 40 years?

03:53.650 --> 03:55.570
Not anymore.

04:00.310 --> 04:02.420
Anyway, any ideas on a gift?

04:02.420 --> 04:04.530
Well, what are some of the things they like?

04:04.840 --> 04:07.120
They used to like going to the Mumbai Symphony,

04:07.120 --> 04:09.350
but last year my mom thought they were phoning it in.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.610
Then my dad said based on their love life,

04:10.610 --> 04:13.610
she should know about phoning it in.

04:14.860 --> 04:16.900
- He said that to her? - Well, they weren't speaking at the time,

04:16.900 --> 04:19.220
so he had a servant say it to her.

04:19.700 --> 04:22.010
Oh, maybe I could make a gift for them.

04:22.010 --> 04:25.970
I know how much you guys love the coasters I made for you.

04:28.230 --> 04:30.560
They're yours in the divorce.

04:34.980 --> 04:36.600
Hey. What're you working on?

04:36.600 --> 04:39.280
Remember when I said if you went through with your surgery,

04:39.280 --> 04:42.200
there was a one-in-700,000 chance of dying?

04:42.960 --> 04:44.010
Yeah...?

04:44.010 --> 04:46.160
Well, I've been crunching the numbers,

04:46.160 --> 04:49.230
and so far, I've gotten your probability of death

04:49.230 --> 04:53.410
all the way to a sphincter-tightening one in 300.

04:55.570 --> 04:56.530
Great timing.

04:56.530 --> 04:59.220
My "Check sphincter" light just went on.

05:00.120 --> 05:02.560
Leonard, what if you have an allergic reaction

05:02.560 --> 05:04.100
to the surgeon's latex gloves?

05:04.100 --> 05:05.790
I'm not allergic to latex.

05:05.790 --> 05:07.210
Well, then why don't you wear the rubber gloves

05:07.210 --> 05:08.760
I bought for you to do the dishes?

05:08.760 --> 05:12.100
For the same reason I don't wear the apron or the hair net.

05:12.750 --> 05:15.290
Fine. What about epilepsy?

05:15.290 --> 05:16.920
I don't have epilepsy, either.

05:16.920 --> 05:19.040
You don't, but the surgeon might, hmm?

05:19.980 --> 05:23.070
And your carotid artery is just one shaky scalpel away

05:23.070 --> 05:25.840
from becoming the dancing fountain at Disneyland.

05:26.690 --> 05:29.880
Sheldon, do you realize that driving is riskier than surgery?

05:29.880 --> 05:33.060
I do. I have the drive to the hospital right here.

05:33.720 --> 05:34.960
That is if you make it to the car

05:34.960 --> 05:37.190
without falling down the stairs.

05:37.190 --> 05:40.420
And don't expect me to carry you, I do that enough in life.

05:41.470 --> 05:43.330
Buddy, I-I get that you're worried about me

05:43.330 --> 05:46.050
and I-I appreciate that, but I'm not going to die.

05:46.050 --> 05:47.750
You don't know that.

05:47.750 --> 05:51.330
I do know that it won't be from an asteroid strike.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.180
You know who else said that?

05:54.180 --> 05:55.590
Every cocky T. Rex currently

05:55.590 --> 05:58.550
swimming around in the gas tank of your car.

05:59.140 --> 06:00.800
I-If there was an asteroid strike,

06:00.800 --> 06:02.140
wouldn't you die, too?

06:02.140 --> 06:03.750
I don't know-- I'm smart and scrappy,

06:03.750 --> 06:05.750
I think I'd find a way.

06:08.210 --> 06:10.340
Tell you what-- the surgery's not for a week,

06:10.340 --> 06:11.250
I'll think about it.

06:11.250 --> 06:12.680
Thank you.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.110
And while you're thinking about it,

06:14.110 --> 06:17.050
if you have the surgery in Nicaragua during monsoon season,

06:17.050 --> 06:19.640
I can practically guarantee your death.

06:24.940 --> 06:26.670
Yes. Okay.

06:27.300 --> 06:28.970
I-I understand.

06:29.350 --> 06:30.110
Of course, yes.

06:30.110 --> 06:31.310
I'll call you tomorrow.

06:32.090 --> 06:32.800
Bye.

06:33.880 --> 06:37.230
So I found this fencing school in Burbank

06:37.230 --> 06:40.230
that has a Jedi class.

06:41.510 --> 06:43.190
And if you're cool being the only adults there,

06:43.190 --> 06:44.940
they said they are.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.190
Dude, my parents just split up.

06:48.190 --> 06:49.080
What?!

06:49.080 --> 06:50.980
Uh, that was my dad on the phone.

06:50.980 --> 06:52.660
He moved out.

06:52.900 --> 06:56.570
Oh, my God, I... I'm sorry.

06:56.570 --> 06:58.710
I mean, if you're not up to it, we don't have to go out,

06:58.710 --> 07:00.140
we can just hang here.

07:00.140 --> 07:01.500
No, it's fine.

07:01.500 --> 07:02.930
It's not that big a deal.

07:02.930 --> 07:05.090
As long as they're happy, I'm happy.

07:05.090 --> 07:07.530
And when I get to see them for the holidays,

07:07.530 --> 07:09.480
I'll get to celebrate Diwali twice...

07:09.480 --> 07:11.470
one at each house.

07:13.360 --> 07:15.690
That's double the Diwali.

07:16.820 --> 07:18.090
You sure you're okay?

07:18.090 --> 07:18.850
I'm okay.

07:18.850 --> 07:19.850
You don't look okay.

07:19.850 --> 07:23.260
How can I be okay? I come from a broken home.

07:25.840 --> 07:28.260
The doctor said I should be out of surgery by 10:00.

07:28.260 --> 07:29.430
Okay.

07:29.430 --> 07:31.070
And Sheldon really believes

07:31.070 --> 07:33.230
we're at a public swimming pool?

07:34.850 --> 07:36.310
He was so busy figuring out

07:36.310 --> 07:38.510
how many parts per million of urine we'd be floating around in,

07:38.510 --> 07:40.620
he didn't even question it.

07:41.560 --> 07:44.250
18 parts per million.

07:45.790 --> 07:47.860
And he's still doing it.

07:47.860 --> 07:50.590
Don't worry about that. I'm happy to take you to work.

07:50.590 --> 07:51.850
Well, thank you.

07:51.850 --> 07:55.760
And Leonard never lets me have French toast sticks in the car.

07:55.940 --> 07:57.900
I can't have syrupy fingers,

07:57.900 --> 08:01.110
but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.930
It's nice they're getting exercise.

08:05.520 --> 08:07.890
Although now that I think about it,

08:07.890 --> 08:09.810
Leonard would never go swimming in public

08:09.810 --> 08:12.270
without his swim shirt.

08:13.330 --> 08:14.930
I'm sure he brought it.

08:14.930 --> 08:17.030
No, but last year, at Magic Mountain,

08:17.030 --> 08:18.430
he got such a bad sunburn,

08:18.430 --> 08:20.950
we had to cut him out of it.

08:22.190 --> 08:24.540
He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast.

08:24.540 --> 08:26.340
Look, there's an entire section of my dashboard

08:26.340 --> 08:28.390
that doesn't have any syrup on it.

08:29.620 --> 08:32.490
You're acting odd. Why?

08:32.810 --> 08:35.440
I'm odd all the time, everyone knows that.

08:35.440 --> 08:37.650
Just last night, I tried to see how many fava beans

08:37.650 --> 08:39.850
I could fit in my mouth.

08:40.900 --> 08:42.360
Tell me the truth.

08:42.360 --> 08:43.820
28.

08:44.270 --> 08:46.260
- Come on. - Fifty-six.

08:47.920 --> 08:48.990
Amy!

08:48.990 --> 08:51.080
What's going on?

08:51.080 --> 08:52.380
All right.

08:53.340 --> 08:55.200
Don't get upset, but...

08:55.590 --> 08:57.830
an earlier appointment opened up for Leonard

08:57.830 --> 09:01.270
and he's getting the surgery right now.

09:05.010 --> 09:06.630
I see.

09:12.360 --> 09:13.950
Take me to Leonard.

09:13.950 --> 09:15.900
Just go to work, he'll be fine.

09:15.900 --> 09:17.800
Amy, he's my best friend,

09:17.800 --> 09:20.620
and if you don't take me, I'm going there anyway.

09:21.180 --> 09:22.510
Fine.

09:23.540 --> 09:25.890
It's sweet that you care about him so much.

09:25.890 --> 09:26.910
I do.

09:27.520 --> 09:28.810
And I wouldn't be able to forgive myself,

09:28.810 --> 09:30.180
if something happened to him

09:30.180 --> 09:33.800
and I wasn't at his bedside to say, "I told you so."

09:47.270 --> 09:48.320
Hello.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.740
We had a really nice swim.

09:49.740 --> 09:50.950
Oh, stop it.

09:52.670 --> 09:54.670
I assume this medical center's already treated

09:54.670 --> 09:58.870
the burns on your bottom from the recent pants fire.

09:59.650 --> 10:01.370
'Cause I'm a liar, liar?

10:01.370 --> 10:03.650
That's for the fire marshal to determine.

10:05.050 --> 10:06.240
You had to tell him?

10:06.240 --> 10:08.050
He wore me down.

10:08.050 --> 10:09.200
And I was distracted.

10:09.200 --> 10:11.920
He has on extra baby powder today.

10:13.210 --> 10:14.200
Is he okay?

10:14.200 --> 10:15.700
He's still in surgery.

10:16.990 --> 10:18.340
Very well.

10:18.340 --> 10:20.600
He's gonna be all right.

10:21.180 --> 10:23.000
That is sticky.

10:25.330 --> 10:28.120
Come on, let's talk about something other than the surgery.

10:28.120 --> 10:29.480
That's a good idea.

10:29.910 --> 10:34.280
Penny, did you and Leonard ever discuss funeral arrangements?

10:35.440 --> 10:38.550
I think she meant something a little happier.

10:39.240 --> 10:42.240
I suppose we could try to make it a celebration,

10:42.240 --> 10:44.630
but he died so young.

10:48.230 --> 10:49.880
- Knock, knock. Hi. - Hey.

10:49.880 --> 10:51.490
What brings you by?

10:53.010 --> 10:55.640
muffin much.

10:56.980 --> 10:58.920
Told you-- not funny.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.790
He's just not laughing

11:00.790 --> 11:05.160
because he's feeling... blue berry.

11:06.610 --> 11:08.000
Tough crowd.

11:10.320 --> 11:12.860
I'm sorry. This is very sweet. Thanks.

11:12.860 --> 11:14.090
So, how you doing?

11:14.090 --> 11:15.790
Better. I guess the news just

11:15.790 --> 11:17.860
hit me a lot harder than I expected.

11:17.860 --> 11:18.950
Well, of course.

11:18.950 --> 11:21.730
I would be devastated if my parents split up.

11:21.730 --> 11:24.810
Why? Your father barely speaks to your mother.

11:24.810 --> 11:26.260
Well, at least he stuck around,

11:26.260 --> 11:28.650
not like your dad, who just took off.

11:28.650 --> 11:31.390
As you can see, we're here to cheer you up.

11:32.770 --> 11:33.910
Sorry, Raj.

11:33.910 --> 11:36.430
Do you have any sense of what happened with your folks?

11:36.430 --> 11:39.800
I think, over time, they started to resent each other,

11:39.800 --> 11:42.020
and instead of talking about the things that bothered them,

11:42.020 --> 11:43.370
they kept it bottled up,

11:43.370 --> 11:45.340
and the hate just grew.

11:45.340 --> 11:48.130
It's a shame they spent all that time unhappy.

11:48.740 --> 11:50.190
But sometimes,

11:50.190 --> 11:53.130
there's muffin you can do about it.

11:55.230 --> 11:57.370
You get it, right?

12:01.210 --> 12:02.810
Oh, it's nice you got him that.

12:02.810 --> 12:04.760
Oh, this isn't for Leonard, no.

12:04.760 --> 12:06.860
Amy bought it for me.

12:09.400 --> 12:12.370
Stubbed his toe on the revolving door on the way in.

12:12.370 --> 12:15.120
You know those confounded things make me dizzy.

12:15.120 --> 12:18.020
Who told you to keep going around?

12:18.350 --> 12:20.100
There was a large plant in the lobby.

12:20.100 --> 12:22.600
It kept looking like the outside.

12:23.710 --> 12:24.960
Okay, listen, when Leonard comes out,

12:24.960 --> 12:25.930
he is not gonna feel great,

12:25.930 --> 12:28.020
so, please don't give him a hard time.

12:28.020 --> 12:29.660
Penny has a good point.

12:29.660 --> 12:31.660
This is like the man in the supermarket

12:31.660 --> 12:33.210
with the goiter on his neck.

12:33.210 --> 12:36.230
Whatever you're thinking, just keep it to yourself.

12:37.130 --> 12:39.530
It was like a grapefruit.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.630
And I'm sure he knew that

12:41.630 --> 12:44.670
before you held a grapefruit up next to it.

12:45.230 --> 12:47.040
Well, I'm not making any promises.

12:47.040 --> 12:49.840
Not only did Leonard take what I feel is an unnecessary risk,

12:49.840 --> 12:50.930
he deceived me.

12:50.930 --> 12:52.160
Okay, the reason he deceived you is

12:52.160 --> 12:53.800
you were being a pain in the ass.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.950
The reason I was being a pain in the B is

12:55.950 --> 12:58.250
because I was worried about him, and no one else was.

12:58.250 --> 12:59.990
Really? You won't even say "A"?

12:59.990 --> 13:02.310
You bet your sweet B I won't.

13:02.970 --> 13:04.470
Obviously, I care about Leonard.

13:04.470 --> 13:06.300
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with him.

13:06.300 --> 13:08.390
And I'm not?

13:11.610 --> 13:12.760
It's an earthquake.

13:12.760 --> 13:14.030
I knew it.

13:14.030 --> 13:15.670
Sheldon, it was just a little tremor.

13:15.670 --> 13:18.430
A little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery

13:18.430 --> 13:20.670
into a frontal lobotomy.

13:24.280 --> 13:26.300
Oh, I don't care for this at all.

13:26.300 --> 13:28.400
Oh, I need to see he's okay.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.280
Sheldon, you can't go back there.

13:30.280 --> 13:31.780
Try and stop me!

13:34.530 --> 13:35.930
Are you okay?

13:35.930 --> 13:38.440
Why didn't you stop me?!

13:41.520 --> 13:43.010
Can I tell you something?

13:43.360 --> 13:45.260
This whole thing with Raj's parents

13:45.260 --> 13:47.800
just got me a little worried about us.

13:47.800 --> 13:50.260
What are you talking about? We're fine.

13:50.260 --> 13:53.740
And Raj's parents probably split up because of Raj.

13:55.180 --> 13:56.030
What?!

13:56.030 --> 13:58.960
They always say the children aren't to blame, but...

13:59.390 --> 14:00.810
Come on.

14:04.570 --> 14:06.240
I'm not joking, Howie.

14:06.240 --> 14:07.810
You heard what he said about his parents.

14:07.810 --> 14:10.240
It was the little things they kept bottled up.

14:10.240 --> 14:12.470
I don't want that to happen to us.

14:12.470 --> 14:14.500
How can I convince you it won't?

14:14.500 --> 14:18.080
Well, is there anything about me you're keeping inside?

14:19.040 --> 14:19.980
I'm not answering that.

14:19.980 --> 14:21.210
It's a trap.

14:24.770 --> 14:27.190
So there are things you don't like.

14:27.190 --> 14:29.710
And here I am in the trap.

14:31.820 --> 14:32.890
You just keep talking.

14:32.890 --> 14:35.020
I'm gonna chew my leg off.

14:36.070 --> 14:37.590
Just tell me one thing that bothers you,

14:37.590 --> 14:39.630
and I promise I won't get mad.

14:39.630 --> 14:42.300
Okay. The truth is...

14:42.300 --> 14:44.820
sometimes... you're too...

14:44.820 --> 14:46.650
beautiful.

14:49.050 --> 14:50.760
Howie, be serious.

14:50.760 --> 14:52.470
Okay, okay.

14:52.470 --> 14:55.320
I really don't like

14:55.320 --> 14:57.520
how your wings poke me when we sleep

14:57.520 --> 14:59.410
'cause you're an angel.

15:02.220 --> 15:04.260
Okay, fine, maybe it was a bad idea.

15:04.260 --> 15:06.060
I just don't think the secret to a happy marriage

15:06.060 --> 15:09.140
is going out of our way to criticize each other.

15:09.140 --> 15:13.290
Although, there are ways to improve our communication.

15:13.290 --> 15:15.910
One thing I learned when I was in couples therapy was...

15:15.910 --> 15:17.490
Who were you in couples therapy with?

15:17.490 --> 15:18.950
Not important.

15:20.940 --> 15:21.800
Was it your mom?

15:21.800 --> 15:23.060
Not important.

15:24.250 --> 15:25.540
It was your mom.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.380
Anyway, the therapist had us tell each other

15:29.380 --> 15:32.300
what we loved about one another.

15:32.300 --> 15:34.030
Oh, that's so sweet!

15:34.030 --> 15:35.390
I want to do that.

15:35.390 --> 15:36.610
All right.

15:37.490 --> 15:38.840
Okay, um...

15:38.840 --> 15:41.860
I love that you make me laugh.

15:41.860 --> 15:43.190
Thank you.

15:43.190 --> 15:48.300
And I love that you're strong and independent.

15:48.300 --> 15:51.330
And yet, I still love when you hold a door for me.

15:51.330 --> 15:55.210
I love that I'm kind of a slob around here, and...

15:55.210 --> 15:57.560
you're okay with that.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.670
Uh-huh.

16:04.240 --> 16:06.460
And I love that I work and do all the cleaning,

16:06.460 --> 16:08.690
and you're okay with that.

16:10.450 --> 16:11.380
See, I am.

16:11.380 --> 16:13.270
Isn't this great?

16:16.610 --> 16:17.830
Come on, smile.

16:17.830 --> 16:20.350
This is gonna be my Christmas card.

16:25.020 --> 16:27.020
You know this is all your fault.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.870
How is it my fault?

16:31.740 --> 16:34.120
I told you not to get the surgery.

16:34.120 --> 16:37.480
Okay, first of all, the surgery was a success,

16:37.480 --> 16:40.060
and secondly, I didn't even want you there.

16:41.910 --> 16:43.020
I don't know which hurts worse...

16:43.020 --> 16:45.240
my nose or my heart.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.160
Well, I'm done speaking to you.

16:48.160 --> 16:49.130
Don't be like that.

16:49.130 --> 16:50.770
You two need to talk this out.

16:50.770 --> 16:53.730
Yeah, 'cause you sound really funny.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.520
Sheldon, I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the surgery,

16:58.520 --> 17:00.490
but you were worried about nothing.

17:00.490 --> 17:02.510
Oh, you're hardly out of the woods, no.

17:02.510 --> 17:05.770
You still run the risk of infection, a blood clot,

17:05.770 --> 17:07.800
the possibility that an inattentive surgeon

17:07.800 --> 17:11.030
let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose.

17:12.530 --> 17:15.740
The minute you sneeze web, I'm moving out.

17:16.130 --> 17:17.860
I never thought I'd say these words,

17:17.860 --> 17:20.530
but come on, nose spider!

17:21.480 --> 17:22.660
Who are you kidding?

17:22.660 --> 17:24.490
You were so panicked Leonard was gonna die,

17:24.490 --> 17:25.710
you'll never leave him.

17:25.710 --> 17:27.490
Sheldon will move out eventually.

17:27.490 --> 17:30.290
Yeah, once he figures out how to work a door.

17:31.680 --> 17:35.220
I was not panicked, and I am not overly attached to Leonard.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.310
You were so worried that you smashed your face

17:37.310 --> 17:38.460
trying to check on me.

17:38.460 --> 17:40.910
You love me.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.560
Yeah. Tell me those aren't the words of a man

17:43.560 --> 17:46.480
with a spider eating its way through his brain.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.750
Amy, you're a neuroscientist.

17:48.750 --> 17:51.700
Crack his skull open, spray some Raid in there.

17:54.410 --> 17:56.880
I love that you take pride in your looks,

17:56.880 --> 17:58.240
even when I have to pee in the morning,

17:58.240 --> 18:01.640
and you're in there spending an hour on your hair.

18:02.280 --> 18:06.650
I love that you're too good to pee in the kitchen sink.

18:07.140 --> 18:09.230
I love that you have the confidence to speak,

18:09.230 --> 18:12.170
even without giving it an ounce of thought.

18:13.830 --> 18:15.960
And I love how your hair is always on the soap.

18:15.960 --> 18:18.890
It's like washing myself with a hamster.

18:20.590 --> 18:24.060
Hey, guys. Sorry I am so late.

18:24.060 --> 18:26.250
I was on the phone with my mother.

18:26.250 --> 18:27.490
Oh, how is she?

18:27.490 --> 18:28.610
Pretty good.

18:28.610 --> 18:30.710
She bought the book Eat, Pray, Love

18:30.710 --> 18:33.690
and used it to set my father's Mercedes on fire.

18:35.940 --> 18:38.590
So, what's up with you guys?

18:39.360 --> 18:41.810
We're just saying all the things we love about each other.

18:41.810 --> 18:44.590
Oh, like you and I did at couples therapy.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.740
Ooh, what'd you get?

18:54.740 --> 18:57.570
Oh, I ordered it before your surgery.

18:57.570 --> 19:00.730
It's the urn I was going to put you in.

19:02.190 --> 19:03.690
Okay, that's morbid.

19:03.690 --> 19:04.820
Send it back.

19:04.820 --> 19:08.350
I can't send it back-- I had it engraved.

19:09.290 --> 19:12.410
"Here lie the ashes of Leonard Hofstadter.

19:12.410 --> 19:16.210
He thought he was right, but his roommate knew better."

19:18.750 --> 19:20.200
That's funny.

19:20.650 --> 19:23.040
Boy, I'm gonna miss these painkillers.

19:23.870 --> 19:26.270
Hey, why did you get two?

19:26.270 --> 19:29.000
- "I'm with stupid." - Oh, that one's mine.
