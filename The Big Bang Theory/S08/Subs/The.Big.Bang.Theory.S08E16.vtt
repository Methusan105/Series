WEBVTT

00:03.830 --> 00:05.460
I just read about an experiment

00:05.460 --> 00:07.390
designed to see if you could make two people fall

00:07.390 --> 00:09.120
in love in a matter of hours.

00:09.120 --> 00:10.670
That doesn't sound right.

00:10.670 --> 00:13.050
My research has shown that it takes three to five years

00:13.050 --> 00:15.290
of shameless begging.

00:15.950 --> 00:18.640
Honey, neither of us comes off good in that story.

00:19.100 --> 00:19.990
Yeah, I-I...

00:19.990 --> 00:22.030
I saw that article you're talking about.

00:22.030 --> 00:25.040
Uh, the participants ask each other a series of questions

00:25.040 --> 00:26.970
designed to promote intimacy.

00:26.970 --> 00:28.290
And then they finish it off by staring

00:28.290 --> 00:29.990
into each other's eyes for four minutes.

00:29.990 --> 00:31.600
Oh, that's nonsense.

00:31.600 --> 00:33.570
I proclaimed my love for you.

00:33.570 --> 00:35.240
And the last time I looked into your eyes

00:35.240 --> 00:38.260
was when you thought you had conjunctivitis.

00:38.690 --> 00:40.390
Other than the fact that I had it,

00:40.390 --> 00:43.110
that was a magical night.

00:43.250 --> 00:45.620
Raj, would you ever try an experiment like that with Emily?

00:45.620 --> 00:48.160
What? I don't need science to win her heart.

00:48.160 --> 00:51.360
I have my family's wealth for that.

00:51.360 --> 00:54.160
I'm telling you, you can't create love in a few hours.

00:54.160 --> 00:55.440
- Right? - Oh, careful.

00:55.440 --> 00:58.930
You're poking at the whole foundation of The Bachelor.

00:59.010 --> 01:01.530
Yeah, but we don't have to debate this.

01:01.530 --> 01:02.560
We're scientists.

01:02.560 --> 01:04.610
We can conduct our own research.

01:04.610 --> 01:07.900
Yeah, I propose that we imprison two street people.

01:07.900 --> 01:09.070
- No. - And...

01:10.430 --> 01:12.230
You didn't even let me finish.

01:12.230 --> 01:13.380
Forget it!

01:13.750 --> 01:16.370
So, you can experiment on all the apes you want.

01:16.370 --> 01:19.510
But I want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings,

01:19.510 --> 01:21.730
suddenly I'm the monster.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.430
Why don't you just do the test?

01:25.430 --> 01:28.310
In the interest of science, I'd be willing to.

01:28.310 --> 01:30.180
What? You're okay with an experiment where you have

01:30.180 --> 01:34.000
to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings?

01:34.000 --> 01:35.300
Yes.

01:35.300 --> 01:37.750
Please, can I do it with him? Please?!

01:38.780 --> 01:41.480
I've been listening to Sheldon's feelings on things for ten years.

01:41.480 --> 01:43.780
Tag, you're it.

01:43.780 --> 01:45.830
Yeah, but what if the experiment works?

01:45.830 --> 01:47.570
I'm not gonna fall in love with Sheldon.

01:47.570 --> 01:48.570
That's what I said.

01:48.570 --> 01:50.200
Before I knew it, he pontificated his way

01:50.200 --> 01:52.380
right into my heart.

01:52.380 --> 01:55.090
Uh, fun fact-- "pontificate"

01:55.090 --> 01:57.010
comes from the Latin word "pontifex,"

01:57.010 --> 02:00.140
which means "bridge builder" or "pope."

02:02.440 --> 02:04.450
In love yet?

02:30.900 --> 02:32.870
Just out of curiosity, Penny,

02:32.870 --> 02:36.180
if this experiment does make us fall in love,

02:36.180 --> 02:39.380
would you drive me to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin

02:39.380 --> 02:41.710
for Gary Con?

02:42.590 --> 02:44.480
It's the only convention celebrating

02:44.480 --> 02:46.800
the life and work of Gary Gygax,

02:46.800 --> 02:50.640
the co-creator of Dungeons and Dragons.

02:50.640 --> 02:52.160
You know what? I can honestly say

02:52.160 --> 02:54.530
if we fall in love, not only will I drive you there,

02:54.530 --> 02:58.130
I will buy you all the dragon T-shirts you want.

02:59.130 --> 03:01.670
Okay, babe, let's do this.

03:04.990 --> 03:06.490
You guys are really being calm

03:06.490 --> 03:08.720
about Penny and Sheldon doing this thing.

03:09.030 --> 03:09.850
If it were me,

03:09.850 --> 03:11.400
I-I'd be a little nervous.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.050
Why?

03:12.050 --> 03:14.060
Well, even if the study's nonsense,

03:14.060 --> 03:16.280
I-I don't believe in tempting fate.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.970
Same reason I wouldn't use a Ouija board,

03:17.970 --> 03:20.430
or pick a fight with an Asian guy.

03:20.880 --> 03:22.540
He probably doesn't know karate, but...

03:22.540 --> 03:24.070
why risk it?

03:25.270 --> 03:26.480
I think we're safe.

03:26.480 --> 03:28.890
Well, that's what the bullies at Bruce Lee's high school thought.

03:28.890 --> 03:30.030
And then, bam!

03:30.030 --> 03:31.820
Karate.

03:32.950 --> 03:35.770
Well, are we just gonna sit here while they do the experiment?

03:35.770 --> 03:37.460
The two of us could do it.

03:37.460 --> 03:38.950
Yeah, sure, that might be fun.

03:38.950 --> 03:40.080
What's the first question?

03:40.080 --> 03:41.740
Hang on.

03:42.040 --> 03:43.070
Okay.

03:43.510 --> 03:46.720
"Given the choice of anyone in the world,

03:46.720 --> 03:49.490
whom would you want as a dinner guest?"

03:51.040 --> 03:53.750
I can honestly say Penny.

03:55.050 --> 03:56.320
Then I choose a janitor.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.810
'Cause I'm about to throw up.

04:00.800 --> 04:01.420
I'm in love.

04:01.420 --> 04:03.180
Let's do something else.

04:04.910 --> 04:06.660
Ooh, uh, Emily gets off work soon.

04:06.660 --> 04:08.180
Why don't the four of us go out?

04:08.180 --> 04:09.060
- Okay. - Sounds good.

04:09.060 --> 04:10.790
Should we call Howard and Bernadette?

04:10.790 --> 04:12.150
I don't know what time their plane gets in,

04:12.150 --> 04:14.260
but let me, let me shoot them a text.

04:14.260 --> 04:16.460
Did he say anything about the funeral?

04:16.460 --> 04:19.610
Not much, but he seemed to be in a pretty good place.

04:19.610 --> 04:20.730
Are you kidding me?!

04:20.730 --> 04:24.040
You lost my mother's ashes?!

04:24.500 --> 04:27.730
No, I-I'm just saying that sometimes bags are misrouted.

04:27.730 --> 04:29.670
All right, fine. Where did you misroute

04:29.670 --> 04:31.560
the only woman who ever loved me?

04:31.560 --> 04:34.470
The first... well, first, I meant first.

04:35.810 --> 04:37.540
I just need some information.

04:37.540 --> 04:38.980
Uh, what's the flight number?

04:38.980 --> 04:40.580
816.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.030
I really did mean first.

04:42.030 --> 04:43.800
Just drop it.

04:44.680 --> 04:46.410
And can you describe the bag?

04:46.410 --> 04:47.820
Um, well, it's, uh, black.

04:47.820 --> 04:49.460
There's a red ribbon tied to the handle...

04:49.460 --> 04:52.600
The world's greatest mom is in the shoe compartment!

04:54.050 --> 04:55.260
You ready to begin?

04:55.260 --> 04:56.510
Yup. Be right there.

04:56.510 --> 04:58.300
I assume you don't want wine.

04:58.300 --> 04:59.200
Correct.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.700
You're not supposed to drink alcohol

05:00.700 --> 05:03.040
when operating heavy machinery.

05:03.040 --> 05:05.040
What heavy machinery?

05:08.800 --> 05:10.210
Let's just start.

05:10.210 --> 05:12.120
Well, as a Texas gentleman,

05:12.120 --> 05:14.160
I'm inclined to say ladies first.

05:14.160 --> 05:17.640
Although, I'm concerned that level of politeness and charm

05:17.640 --> 05:20.970
might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins.

05:20.970 --> 05:22.460
Perhaps we should flip a coin.

05:22.460 --> 05:24.450
Or if you're familiar with the rules

05:24.450 --> 05:27.760
- of Rock, Paper, Scissors... - Question one.

05:28.310 --> 05:29.980
"Given the choice of anyone in the world,

05:29.980 --> 05:32.340
whom would you want as a dinner guest?"

05:33.960 --> 05:35.480
Living or dead?

05:35.480 --> 05:36.760
Just says "Anyone in the world."

05:36.760 --> 05:37.910
I guess that means living.

05:37.910 --> 05:39.280
Ah, that's just as well.

05:39.280 --> 05:41.220
As much as I'd love to meet Euclid--

05:41.220 --> 05:42.740
inventor of the geometric proof--

05:42.740 --> 05:44.350
he probably wore sandals

05:44.350 --> 05:47.180
and I cannot look at toes during dinner.

05:48.450 --> 05:50.010
Oh, I know!

05:50.010 --> 05:52.190
The person I'd most like to have dinner with

05:52.190 --> 05:53.950
is myself.

05:55.840 --> 05:56.750
You sure that's your choice?

05:56.750 --> 05:58.950
'Cause I've had that dinner.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.500
Well, I haven't.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.290
And while they say never meet your heroes,

06:02.290 --> 06:04.780
I just don't see how I could disappoint.

06:05.110 --> 06:06.500
Who would you choose?

06:06.500 --> 06:07.690
Robert Downey, Jr.

06:07.690 --> 06:08.610
You...

06:09.960 --> 06:12.010
I didn't think of Iron Man.

06:14.080 --> 06:16.060
You know, maybe after myself and I have dinner,

06:16.060 --> 06:18.460
we can meet you two for dessert.

06:21.620 --> 06:22.960
So, what do you guys want to do?

06:22.960 --> 06:25.190
Well, we're the ones tagging along, you pick.

06:26.110 --> 06:28.190
Have you ever been to an escape room?

06:28.190 --> 06:29.080
Mm-mm, what's that?

06:29.080 --> 06:31.240
Um... it's kind of like interactive theater,

06:31.240 --> 06:32.570
except you have to solve puzzles

06:32.570 --> 06:34.300
in a certain amount of time to get out.

06:34.300 --> 06:35.590
There's one downtown where

06:35.590 --> 06:37.820
they trap you in a room with a zombie.

06:39.290 --> 06:42.610
So, kind of like what's happening with Penny right now.

06:45.710 --> 06:47.430
"What would constitute

06:47.430 --> 06:49.680
a perfect day for you?"

06:49.680 --> 06:51.300
Uh, well...

06:51.300 --> 06:54.810
I'd probably sleep in, do a little yoga,

06:54.810 --> 06:56.160
then lie on the beach while

06:56.160 --> 06:58.590
cute cabana boys brought me drinks and...

06:59.550 --> 07:00.780
probably get a massage

07:00.780 --> 07:03.280
and then cap off the night with some dancing.

07:03.660 --> 07:04.560
That's it?

07:04.560 --> 07:05.800
Yeah, why?

07:05.800 --> 07:08.310
You didn't mention Leonard.

07:09.580 --> 07:11.200
He's there.

07:13.070 --> 07:14.360
I don't think so.

07:14.690 --> 07:16.400
Leonard can't stand yoga,

07:16.400 --> 07:19.010
the beach, massages or dancing.

07:19.010 --> 07:20.300
Yeah, well, he brought a book, okay?

07:20.300 --> 07:21.580
What's yours?

07:23.700 --> 07:25.600
Uh, I wake up.

07:25.600 --> 07:29.250
Uh, I enjoy some French toast with butter and syrup.

07:29.250 --> 07:32.320
Uh, then a wormhole opens,

07:32.400 --> 07:36.410
and whisks me millions of years into the future

07:36.410 --> 07:39.140
where my towering intellect is used to save

07:39.140 --> 07:41.390
the last remnants of mankind

07:41.390 --> 07:44.350
from a predatory alien race.

07:45.560 --> 07:48.210
Interesting, you didn't mention Amy.

07:49.370 --> 07:52.250
Who do you think made the French toast with butter and syrup?

07:54.150 --> 07:55.450
You're about to enter the lab

07:55.450 --> 07:57.990
of the late Dr. David Saltzberg.

07:57.990 --> 08:01.020
While conducting studies on slowing the aging process,

08:01.020 --> 08:04.900
there was a catastrophic accident and he died.

08:05.950 --> 08:08.110
Or did he?

08:09.130 --> 08:10.000
Ladies?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.800
Are you being polite or scared?

08:13.240 --> 08:15.020
Yup.

08:17.580 --> 08:18.670
Ah, what a room!

08:24.190 --> 08:25.290
This is cool.

08:25.290 --> 08:26.530
So, how do we start?

08:26.530 --> 08:29.130
We have to look for the clues hidden around the room.

08:29.130 --> 08:30.860
Uh, wasn't there supposed to be a zombie?

08:35.440 --> 08:37.140
Okay, let's hope one of the clues

08:37.140 --> 08:39.710
is written on a pair of clean underwear.

08:41.840 --> 08:43.360
Mr. And Mrs. Wolowitz?

08:43.360 --> 08:46.720
As far as I can tell, your bag arrived in Los Angeles.

08:46.720 --> 08:47.900
So, where is it?

08:47.900 --> 08:49.610
I don't know, perhaps somebody

08:49.610 --> 08:52.000
took it off the carousel by mistake?

08:52.550 --> 08:55.400
So, some stranger has my mom?

08:55.400 --> 08:56.350
Is that what you're telling me?

08:56.350 --> 09:00.570
My poor mother can be anywhere in Los Angeles right now?

09:00.570 --> 09:03.790
I-I wish I was telling you that.

09:03.790 --> 09:05.800
Um...but the passenger could've gotten

09:05.800 --> 09:08.200
on an international flight.

09:08.870 --> 09:09.910
Oh, okay, great!

09:09.910 --> 09:12.390
So, your entire job is to find lost luggage,

09:12.390 --> 09:13.880
and you've narrowed down the location

09:13.880 --> 09:16.850
of my mother to the planet Earth!

09:17.310 --> 09:18.540
I'm sorry!

09:18.540 --> 09:21.050
W-Would 500 frequent-flyer miles help?

09:21.050 --> 09:23.660
That could get you to Sacramento.

09:26.210 --> 09:28.440
"If you could wake up tomorrow

09:28.440 --> 09:31.880
having gained any one quality or ability,

09:31.880 --> 09:33.570
what would it be?"

09:33.570 --> 09:35.500
Well, not to steal from the Bible,

09:35.500 --> 09:38.680
but turning water into wine sounds pretty good.

09:41.950 --> 09:44.700
I don't think you're taking this seriously.

09:45.250 --> 09:47.410
Come on, I'm just having some fun with you.

09:47.410 --> 09:49.290
I believe what you're doing

09:49.290 --> 09:53.160
is using humor to avoid vulnerability.

09:53.720 --> 09:55.030
Fine.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.510
Honestly...

09:57.970 --> 09:59.650
if I could have one quality...

10:00.240 --> 10:03.750
I wish I could be as smart as you guys.

10:03.750 --> 10:06.060
Ha! Keep dreaming.

10:07.540 --> 10:08.350
Sheldon!

10:08.350 --> 10:10.120
I'm sorry.

10:10.120 --> 10:12.320
That was me having fun with you.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.440
Look.

10:13.440 --> 10:15.560
You may not be as...

10:15.560 --> 10:18.620
academically inclined as are we.

10:18.620 --> 10:21.170
Yes, that's how you say it.

10:21.880 --> 10:22.560
But...

10:23.730 --> 10:26.590
You possess an intelligence I envy.

10:26.900 --> 10:29.110
Which leads me to my answer.

10:29.110 --> 10:31.090
I would choose the ability

10:31.090 --> 10:33.510
to read people's minds.

10:33.850 --> 10:36.790
Well, I can't read people's minds.

10:36.790 --> 10:37.970
Actually, that's not true.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.160
I can read men's minds.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.870
But only 'cause it's usually the one thing.

10:43.350 --> 10:46.010
When are we going to get robot eyes?

10:47.130 --> 10:49.890
You're all alike.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.390
Well, what I meant was...

10:52.830 --> 10:54.780
I often misinterpret

10:54.780 --> 10:56.410
how others are feeling.

10:56.410 --> 10:59.740
Like, I can't always tell if someone is only joking

10:59.740 --> 11:01.220
or laughing at me.

11:01.220 --> 11:03.910
You know, like, uh, if they're mad at something I've done

11:03.910 --> 11:05.530
or just in a bad mood.

11:05.530 --> 11:07.990
It-it's incredibly stressful.

11:07.990 --> 11:10.310
Really? You always seem so confident.

11:10.310 --> 11:11.490
Well, I'm not.

11:11.490 --> 11:14.430
And if I could read people's minds,

11:14.430 --> 11:16.430
life would be so much simpler.

11:17.840 --> 11:20.650
Well, now I wish I had the ability

11:20.650 --> 11:23.140
to make that stuff easier for you.

11:24.770 --> 11:25.760
Thank you.

11:29.820 --> 11:31.040
Wow, I just felt

11:31.040 --> 11:34.020
this wave of affection for you.

11:36.060 --> 11:38.770
You sure it's not too much Bible juice?

11:41.370 --> 11:44.000
And the wave is gone.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.030
Brains!

11:49.030 --> 11:51.740
Keep it down! We're working here.

11:51.740 --> 11:53.560
Okay, we've got the cipher decoded!

11:53.560 --> 11:54.800
How's it going with the globe?

11:54.800 --> 11:56.800
We used the coordinates to locate the cities.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.320
I'm putting the city names in the grid now.

11:58.320 --> 12:00.110
I'm sure that'll give us the code to the safe.

12:00.110 --> 12:01.950
Solve puzzle too fast!

12:01.950 --> 12:03.640
Slow down!

12:04.160 --> 12:05.550
Yup! Got the code.

12:05.550 --> 12:06.750
Just saying...

12:06.750 --> 12:10.320
no refund for finish early!

12:14.190 --> 12:16.060
Sure you don't want to go home?

12:16.060 --> 12:18.350
When the bag's returned, they'll deliver it to us.

12:18.350 --> 12:21.490
No, I'm not leaving without her.

12:21.490 --> 12:24.180
All right, we'll wait.

12:27.350 --> 12:29.320
I could've driven her.

12:29.320 --> 12:30.850
What?

12:31.240 --> 12:33.790
The day she left for Florida.

12:34.540 --> 12:37.320
She asked me to drive her to the airport.

12:39.490 --> 12:41.920
I-I was too busy.

12:41.920 --> 12:44.490
And...I made her

12:44.490 --> 12:46.900
take a cab.

12:48.450 --> 12:50.990
I was too busy.

12:51.510 --> 12:54.220
There's no way you could've known.

12:56.310 --> 12:58.240
Be right back.

13:00.770 --> 13:02.050
Excuse me?

13:02.310 --> 13:03.390
Yes?

13:05.510 --> 13:07.090
You better find my husband's mother

13:07.090 --> 13:09.370
'cause one way or another, we're walking out of this airport

13:09.370 --> 13:11.540
with a dead woman!

13:17.070 --> 13:18.480
Which book are we looking for?

13:18.480 --> 13:20.180
Origin of Species.

13:20.180 --> 13:21.080
Here it is.

13:22.550 --> 13:23.520
There's a black light.

13:23.520 --> 13:24.440
Oh, hang on.

13:28.110 --> 13:28.900
Oh, okay.

13:28.900 --> 13:31.360
Uh, "Brothers and sisters I have none,

13:31.360 --> 13:34.160
but this man's father is my father's son.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.120
Who am I looking at?"

13:37.680 --> 13:39.230
Yeah, yeah, we get it-- you want brains.

13:39.230 --> 13:40.850
Calm down.

13:40.850 --> 13:42.510
Well, if I don't have a brother,

13:42.510 --> 13:44.170
my father's son is me.

13:44.170 --> 13:47.540
And if I'm this man's father, then he's my son.

13:47.540 --> 13:48.610
The answer's "son."

13:48.610 --> 13:50.040
Ooh! There's a picture of the sun over there.

13:50.040 --> 13:51.300
I bet the key's behind it.

13:51.300 --> 13:52.740
Could be somewhere else!

13:54.220 --> 13:55.430
Oh, got the key!

13:55.430 --> 13:57.390
So, that's the key to the door?

13:57.390 --> 13:58.670
That's it?

13:58.670 --> 14:01.700
We spent $200 on six minutes of fun?

14:01.700 --> 14:04.070
It's like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter,

14:04.070 --> 14:08.130
and it just... flew away.

14:08.130 --> 14:09.410
Sorry, guys.

14:09.410 --> 14:11.580
Really thought the puzzles would be better.

14:11.580 --> 14:15.260
Well, to be fair, we do all have advanced degrees.

14:15.670 --> 14:18.820
Remember that before you post on Yelp!

14:21.220 --> 14:23.770
"If you were to die this evening with no opportunity

14:23.770 --> 14:25.150
to communicate with anyone,

14:25.150 --> 14:28.690
what would you most regret not having told someone?"

14:29.120 --> 14:31.230
So, it would be today?

14:33.730 --> 14:35.660
Well, I suppose there's something satisfying

14:35.660 --> 14:38.210
about dying on my birthday.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.130
Today's your birthday?

14:40.130 --> 14:41.090
Yes.

14:41.090 --> 14:43.370
Well, that's always been a secret!

14:43.370 --> 14:45.210
Not even Amy knows!

14:45.210 --> 14:48.890
Well, I don't enjoy presents.

14:48.890 --> 14:50.340
And the thought of people

14:50.340 --> 14:52.790
jumping out and yelling "Surprise!"

14:52.790 --> 14:54.870
fills me with more dread than the words

14:54.870 --> 14:58.170
"George Lucas Director's Cut."

14:58.660 --> 15:01.130
So, why did you finally tell me?

15:01.620 --> 15:03.150
The point of the experiment is

15:03.150 --> 15:05.570
to be completely honest with each other.

15:06.430 --> 15:08.970
Well, thank you for sharing it with me.

15:08.970 --> 15:10.690
I won't tell anyone.

15:10.690 --> 15:12.220
Thank you.

15:12.220 --> 15:13.690
That is so funny.

15:13.690 --> 15:15.540
I never would have pegged you for a Pisces.

15:15.540 --> 15:19.190
You're making it difficult to love you right now.

15:21.510 --> 15:24.160
Great news! Your bag was returned.

15:24.160 --> 15:25.410
Oh, thank God!

15:25.410 --> 15:27.030
It's okay, she's here!

15:27.030 --> 15:28.230
Ma's here.

15:28.230 --> 15:30.010
Okay, thank you so much.

15:30.010 --> 15:31.160
Ma?

15:31.160 --> 15:34.930
I'm sorry I didn't take you to the airport.

15:34.930 --> 15:35.690
I just want you to know

15:35.690 --> 15:38.870
that I'll never forgive myself for being so selfish.

15:38.870 --> 15:40.420
And I promise

15:40.420 --> 15:42.090
to keep you close

15:42.090 --> 15:44.340
for the rest of my life.

15:45.370 --> 15:49.770
Oh, no. That thing's gonna end up in my bedroom.

15:51.560 --> 15:53.480
That's it! We're done with the questions.

15:53.480 --> 15:55.750
All that's left to do is stare into each other's eyes

15:55.750 --> 15:57.280
for four minutes without talking.

15:57.280 --> 15:58.060
Okay.

15:58.060 --> 15:59.230
Wait, hang on!

15:59.230 --> 16:00.870
Bladder check.

16:02.880 --> 16:04.650
We're good to go.

16:06.460 --> 16:07.220
You ready?

16:07.220 --> 16:07.900
Yes.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.430
And begin.

16:25.780 --> 16:28.710
This is kind of creepy.

16:29.320 --> 16:30.680
We're not supposed to talk during this part.

16:30.680 --> 16:31.920
Sorry.

16:39.190 --> 16:41.180
This is kind of creepy.

16:42.390 --> 16:43.550
Do you want to stop?

16:43.550 --> 16:45.570
I know you have trouble with eye contact.

16:45.570 --> 16:50.660
Well, you have a brown fleck in your right iris

16:50.660 --> 16:54.340
that looks like a Formula One race car.

16:54.340 --> 16:58.510
So... I'm just concentrating on that.

16:59.200 --> 17:00.630
Plus, it's easier around people

17:00.630 --> 17:02.470
that I'm comfortable with.

17:02.470 --> 17:05.870
Aw, sweetie, I'm comfortable around you, too.

17:05.870 --> 17:09.160
Of course you are, I'm warm and soothing.

17:10.230 --> 17:13.660
I'm like a human bowl of tomato soup.

17:14.540 --> 17:16.240
I meant more like a little brother.

17:18.800 --> 17:22.130
Well, I suppose I do think of you as a sister.

17:23.050 --> 17:25.540
And sometimes, a mother.

17:26.390 --> 17:28.090
It's getting creepy again.

17:36.140 --> 17:37.390
What?

17:37.390 --> 17:40.590
Just thinking about the day I met you and Leonard.

17:40.590 --> 17:42.720
It was a Monday afternoon.

17:42.720 --> 17:45.200
You joined us for Indian food.

17:45.680 --> 17:47.680
Can you believe it's been eight years?

17:47.680 --> 17:50.770
Yeah, and you're still eating our food.

17:54.430 --> 17:56.370
I... can't remember a time

17:56.370 --> 17:59.170
you guys weren't in my life.

17:59.170 --> 18:01.820
I remember it perfectly.

18:02.310 --> 18:05.250
But I have an eidetic memory.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.560
If you're interested, I also remember

18:07.560 --> 18:09.920
how much you owe us for the food.

18:14.950 --> 18:16.100
That's it.

18:16.440 --> 18:17.570
That wasn't so bad.

18:17.570 --> 18:19.120
No, it wasn't.

18:19.120 --> 18:22.830
Uh, now let's tabulate the results of the experiment.

18:23.600 --> 18:27.340
I think it's safe to say that you're not in love with me

18:27.340 --> 18:29.480
and I'm not in love with you.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.890
And psychology has once again

18:31.890 --> 18:35.860
proved itself the doofus of the sciences.

18:37.210 --> 18:38.280
Well, maybe.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.610
But I'm still glad we did it.

18:40.610 --> 18:43.380
I do feel closer to you.

18:44.070 --> 18:45.720
And I, you.

18:46.070 --> 18:49.910
And yes, that's how you say that.

18:50.710 --> 18:54.370
Yeah, so, given our newfound intimacy,

18:54.370 --> 18:56.930
I'd say we have some hard choices to make.

18:56.930 --> 18:58.070
Like what?

18:58.070 --> 19:01.290
Gary Con-- do we fly or drive?

19:01.290 --> 19:03.570
Do we wear costumes?

19:03.570 --> 19:05.360
And if so...

19:05.720 --> 19:08.050
who gets to be Gary?

19:12.510 --> 19:14.680
Thank you for walking me home.

19:14.680 --> 19:17.080
I just want to make sure you get there safe.

19:18.750 --> 19:22.100
Well, this is me.

19:23.220 --> 19:25.290
It's been a very interesting evening.

19:25.290 --> 19:27.240
It really has.

19:29.880 --> 19:32.070
Surprise!

19:34.860 --> 19:37.880
And after I let you be Gary!
