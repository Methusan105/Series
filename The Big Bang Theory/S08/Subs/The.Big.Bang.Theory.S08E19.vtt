WEBVTT

00:03.310 --> 00:06.030
Leonard, I've been working on an opening joke

00:06.030 --> 00:07.610
for our lecture at Berkeley.

00:07.880 --> 00:08.970
Oh, I like to laugh.

00:08.970 --> 00:10.900
But say it anyway.

00:11.760 --> 00:13.500
Okay, um...

00:13.880 --> 00:16.090
What do you say to a graduate

00:16.090 --> 00:18.430
of the UC Berkeley physics department?

00:18.430 --> 00:20.770
I'll have fries with that.

00:21.580 --> 00:23.690
Because his education hasn't prepared him

00:23.690 --> 00:25.970
for a career in the sciences.

00:27.750 --> 00:29.010
You know, when they chase you out of there,

00:29.010 --> 00:31.420
you only have to run faster than Sheldon.

00:31.930 --> 00:33.240
Are you all set for your trip?

00:33.240 --> 00:34.450
Yeah, I think so.

00:34.450 --> 00:37.650
I just restocked the old PRK.

00:37.650 --> 00:38.600
"P.R.K"?

00:38.600 --> 00:40.920
Public restroom kit.

00:42.040 --> 00:43.950
Everything a boy needs for making pee pee

00:43.950 --> 00:46.440
in new and strange places.

00:46.850 --> 00:49.150
I don't see what's crazy about bringing a backpack

00:49.150 --> 00:51.180
with your own toilet paper and Purell.

00:51.180 --> 00:52.810
Keep going.

00:52.810 --> 00:56.300
And rubber gloves, uh, air freshener.

00:56.300 --> 00:58.480
Um, noise-cancelling headphones.

00:58.480 --> 01:00.350
Oh, danger whistle.

01:01.290 --> 01:02.940
pepper spray.

01:02.940 --> 01:06.120
Ooh, a multi-language "Occupied" sign.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.050
Uh, let's see.

01:07.050 --> 01:10.500
We have seat protectors, uh, booties for my shoes,

01:10.500 --> 01:12.790
a clothespin for my nose.

01:12.790 --> 01:15.780
Oh, and a mirror on a stick,

01:15.780 --> 01:18.180
so I can make sure the person in the stall next to me

01:18.180 --> 01:20.540
isn't some kind of weirdo.

01:23.270 --> 01:24.700
You still worried some Berkeley girl

01:24.700 --> 01:26.380
is gonna steal him away?

01:26.380 --> 01:29.560
Yes, who do you think gave him the danger whistle?

01:58.220 --> 02:00.840
Would you like to play a physics car game I invented

02:00.840 --> 02:03.080
called "I Can't Spy"?

02:03.560 --> 02:06.250
It's all the nail-biting tension of "I Spy"

02:06.250 --> 02:08.590
but the added fun of subatomic particles

02:08.590 --> 02:11.500
and waves outside the visible spectrum.

02:11.500 --> 02:12.840
If it's half as much fun as

02:12.840 --> 02:15.000
"One Times Ten to the Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall,"

02:15.000 --> 02:16.640
I'm in.

02:17.530 --> 02:18.580
I'll begin.

02:18.840 --> 02:23.500
Uh, I can't spy with my little eye...

02:23.890 --> 02:26.710
something passing right through us.

02:26.710 --> 02:28.780
That soy Frappuccino I had.

02:29.910 --> 02:31.440
Will you please play the game?

02:31.440 --> 02:33.920
I can't spy with my little eye

02:33.920 --> 02:35.970
something passing right through us.

02:35.970 --> 02:38.130
I don't know, um...

02:38.130 --> 02:40.500
If 65 billion solar neutrinos pass

02:40.500 --> 02:42.990
through a square centimeter every second,

02:42.990 --> 02:44.890
given the surface area of this car is

02:44.890 --> 02:46.820
about 60,000 square centimeters,

02:46.820 --> 02:51.880
that means 3.9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos?

02:53.550 --> 02:55.690
I don't want to play anymore.

02:57.460 --> 02:58.840
We haven't been on a road trip in a while.

02:58.840 --> 02:59.690
This is fun.

02:59.690 --> 03:00.910
We get it-- you won the game.

03:00.910 --> 03:02.410
Stop bragging.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.120
No, listen, we wrote a paper together.

03:05.120 --> 03:06.950
Now we get to go to a university and talk about it?

03:06.950 --> 03:09.010
That's pretty cool.

03:09.360 --> 03:11.190
I suppose it is.

03:11.190 --> 03:15.650
In fact, if you'd like to celebrate with a little music,

03:15.650 --> 03:17.510
I'd be okay with that.

03:17.960 --> 03:20.200
What...?

03:21.140 --> 03:23.990
This road trip just got crazy.

03:24.630 --> 03:27.340
Play that funky music, white boy.

03:28.980 --> 03:31.230
I'm surprised you know that reference.

03:31.930 --> 03:33.970
What reference?

03:37.160 --> 03:39.490
So, I put stickers on everything we're gonna sell.

03:39.490 --> 03:41.740
We just need help taking it all out to the driveway.

03:41.740 --> 03:43.270
Can I be in charge of pricing?

03:43.270 --> 03:45.570
I've been going to garage sales my whole life.

03:45.570 --> 03:48.360
Can you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel?

03:49.620 --> 03:51.460
All right, Amy's in charge of pricing

03:51.460 --> 03:53.610
and being 75.

03:54.610 --> 03:56.300
Hey, Penny, can you give me a hand with this?

03:56.300 --> 03:57.060
Sure.

03:57.060 --> 03:58.670
Aw, we had one of these growing up.

03:58.670 --> 04:00.230
I used to play all the time.

04:00.230 --> 04:02.440
Oh, yeah? I love Ping-Pong.

04:02.440 --> 04:04.770
Oh, I meant beer pong.

04:05.150 --> 04:06.290
I had a table, too,

04:06.290 --> 04:07.840
but I didn't have any friends,

04:07.840 --> 04:10.200
so all I did was serve.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.540
You know, you can leave one side up and play against it.

04:13.540 --> 04:16.280
And if I had a friend, they might have told me that.

04:19.790 --> 04:21.040
Excuse me.

04:21.040 --> 04:22.670
Why is there a sticker on this?

04:22.670 --> 04:24.930
It's my TARDIS from Doctor Who.

04:24.930 --> 04:27.080
I was planning on moving it in the house.

04:27.080 --> 04:29.370
I think you just answered your own question.

04:30.260 --> 04:32.730
Come on, one day, this may double in value

04:32.730 --> 04:35.490
and be worth half what I paid for it.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.060
Sweetie, we have a lot to do.

04:37.060 --> 04:39.230
We don't need to decide this right now.

04:39.230 --> 04:41.980
Well, I guess as long as you're keeping an open mind.

04:41.980 --> 04:44.060
Of course.

04:48.890 --> 04:52.820
Play that funky music, white boy

04:52.820 --> 04:57.270
Play that funky music right

04:57.270 --> 04:59.830
Play that funky music, white boy

04:59.830 --> 05:01.740
So... they're requesting

05:01.740 --> 05:05.140
that the white boy play the funky music, yes?

05:05.770 --> 05:07.100
Yes.

05:07.100 --> 05:10.320
And this music we're listening to right now

05:10.320 --> 05:12.180
is funky as well?

05:13.300 --> 05:15.100
Sure.

05:15.630 --> 05:17.080
Let me ask you this.

05:17.080 --> 05:18.390
Do you think

05:18.390 --> 05:23.230
this song is the music the white boy ultimately play?

05:24.750 --> 05:26.590
It could be.

05:26.590 --> 05:30.390
So it's like the musical equivalent of Russell's Paradox,

05:30.390 --> 05:33.060
the question of whether the set of all sets

05:33.060 --> 05:36.220
that don't contain themselves as members contains itself?

05:36.220 --> 05:38.180
- Exactly. - Well...

05:38.540 --> 05:39.500
then I hate it.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.240
Music should just be fun.

05:43.890 --> 05:45.280
Making great time.

05:45.280 --> 05:46.890
Gonna be there pretty early.

05:47.410 --> 05:49.070
Will our hotel room be ready?

05:49.070 --> 05:50.590
I doubt it.

05:51.190 --> 05:53.020
Aren't you worried that sitting in the lobby

05:53.020 --> 05:54.550
for a long period of time

05:54.550 --> 05:58.260
might attract the attention of the hotel detective?

05:59.050 --> 05:59.920
If we do,

05:59.920 --> 06:03.030
we'll just tell him to "hit the bricks, see?"

06:04.760 --> 06:07.960
Seems a little confrontational, but all right.

06:09.340 --> 06:13.250
You know, we won't be very far from Skywalker Ranch.

06:13.250 --> 06:15.330
Oh, that's true.

06:15.330 --> 06:17.240
It's not like we can get in there.

06:17.240 --> 06:18.670
Why not?

06:19.250 --> 06:21.030
I-I don't think George Lucas put his headquarters

06:21.030 --> 06:22.060
in the middle of nowhere

06:22.060 --> 06:24.660
because he wanted people dropping in.

06:25.110 --> 06:28.310
Yoda's swamp was in the middle of nowhere.

06:28.310 --> 06:30.760
Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere.

06:30.760 --> 06:33.760
Hoth was in the middle of nowhere.

06:34.200 --> 06:35.650
That's code, Leonard.

06:35.650 --> 06:37.790
He wants us to drop in.

06:40.580 --> 06:41.630
We do have time.

06:41.630 --> 06:44.650
I mean, we could drive by and just look at it.

06:44.650 --> 06:46.150
Yes! Oh...

06:46.600 --> 06:48.470
I'm so excited.

06:48.470 --> 06:50.710
And I just can't hide it.

06:51.730 --> 06:55.690
"I'm about to lose control, and I think I like it."

06:56.870 --> 06:59.520
What are you talking about?

07:04.710 --> 07:06.870
So when do you guys think you're gonna move in?

07:07.120 --> 07:09.680
We're still figuring how much remodeling we want to do.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.560
It's tricky finding the right balance between

07:11.560 --> 07:15.580
"Tasteful modern" and "Jewish mother tchotchke crapfest."

07:16.740 --> 07:18.920
Have you made a decision about the TARDIS?

07:18.920 --> 07:20.350
I think I can sell it if we call it,

07:20.350 --> 07:22.880
"Big British Porta-Potty."

07:24.980 --> 07:27.270
We're not selling it-- it's mine.

07:27.270 --> 07:28.760
You can't just decide.

07:28.760 --> 07:30.470
How about I arm-wrestle you?

07:30.470 --> 07:31.620
That's not fair.

07:31.620 --> 07:36.280
It's like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.870
You could play Ping-Pong for it.

07:38.870 --> 07:40.080
I would do that.

07:40.080 --> 07:40.930
How is that fair?

07:40.930 --> 07:42.130
You grew up with a table.

07:42.130 --> 07:44.650
Yes, but I mostly used it as a battlefield

07:44.650 --> 07:47.560
in an ongoing war between the Transformers and the ThunderCats

07:47.560 --> 07:50.750
for control of a bra I had found in the woods.

07:51.750 --> 07:53.790
Bernadette, for every episode of Doctor Who

07:53.790 --> 07:55.170
Leonard has made me sit through,

07:55.170 --> 07:56.490
I will play on your behalf

07:56.490 --> 07:58.560
and send that TARDIS back to Gallifrey,

07:58.560 --> 08:01.070
where I hate that I know it belongs.

08:01.550 --> 08:03.550
Yes, Penny plays for me.

08:03.550 --> 08:06.850
That's not fair-- she has upper body muscles.

08:07.650 --> 08:10.620
Dude, three-time Sanskriti School

08:10.620 --> 08:14.040
for Well-Born Boys badminton champion.

08:14.550 --> 08:16.540
That's right-- okay, Raj can play for me.

08:16.540 --> 08:18.030
Ooh, you just chose champions.

08:18.030 --> 08:20.160
It's like we're reenacting the ancient German practice

08:20.160 --> 08:22.020
- of trial by combat. - Yeah, it's also like

08:22.020 --> 08:24.530
when the Mountain fought the Red Viper in Game of Thrones.

08:24.530 --> 08:26.170
Leonard makes you watch that, too?

08:26.170 --> 08:27.220
No, no, I like that show.

08:27.220 --> 08:29.700
It's got dragons and people doing it.

08:31.200 --> 08:31.860
So it's settled.

08:31.860 --> 08:34.310
The fate of Doctor Who's TARDIS will be decided

08:34.310 --> 08:36.810
by a Game of Thrones inspired death-match on the battlefield

08:36.810 --> 08:40.100
of ThunderCats versus Transformers.

08:40.100 --> 08:43.310
If you still have that bra, I'll give you a nickel for it.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.250
There it is.

08:52.630 --> 08:55.230
It's just a gate.

08:55.680 --> 08:57.930
On a road.

08:58.520 --> 09:01.070
Wasn't even that hard to find.

09:03.530 --> 09:04.750
This is so amazing!

09:04.750 --> 09:06.100
I know!

09:08.050 --> 09:09.230
You want to get a picture?

09:09.230 --> 09:10.690
I want more than a picture.

09:10.690 --> 09:11.910
I want to go in.

09:11.910 --> 09:14.160
Well, so do I, but they'll never let us.

09:14.550 --> 09:17.300
Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny?

09:17.300 --> 09:18.990
No, but I don't have three years

09:18.990 --> 09:21.730
to make that gate feel sorry for me.

09:24.060 --> 09:25.350
Uh, there's a speaker box.

09:25.350 --> 09:26.910
Drive up, push the button,

09:26.910 --> 09:28.870
and let's see what happens.

09:30.300 --> 09:31.550
Okay, yeah.

09:31.550 --> 09:33.310
What do we have to lose?

09:41.890 --> 09:43.550
I'm a little nervous.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.800
Well, get over it.

09:45.800 --> 09:48.700
Confidence is key in these situations.

09:48.700 --> 09:49.620
Right.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.260
You pushed it-- are you out of your mind?!

09:56.410 --> 09:57.300
May I help you?

09:57.300 --> 09:59.820
Uh, uh... we don't have an appointment,

09:59.820 --> 10:00.760
and-and we don't belong here,

10:00.760 --> 10:03.620
but we-we're, like, crazy-big fans.

10:03.620 --> 10:04.290
I mean...

10:05.030 --> 10:07.300
"Crazy for Star Wars" crazy,

10:07.300 --> 10:10.160
not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape,

10:10.160 --> 10:11.660
although we do have a backpack

10:11.660 --> 10:14.140
that you really don't want to look in.

10:16.540 --> 10:17.710
You're blowing it.

10:17.710 --> 10:19.520
We want to meet George Lucas

10:19.520 --> 10:22.730
and become his friends and play with him!

10:24.510 --> 10:25.710
Hello?

10:25.710 --> 10:28.020
This speaker's not working, just pull up.

10:32.490 --> 10:34.780
And that's how it's done.

10:43.280 --> 10:47.560
All right, we've defeated the first challenge.

10:47.560 --> 10:51.020
Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster

10:51.020 --> 10:52.900
who defends the gate.

10:54.230 --> 10:56.230
We're trying to get past a security guard,

10:56.230 --> 10:58.420
not rescue Zelda.

10:59.650 --> 11:02.180
I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy,

11:02.180 --> 11:04.200
but one quest at a time.

11:05.640 --> 11:07.170
So what's the plan?

11:07.170 --> 11:10.140
Uh, I'm just gonna be honest with the guy.

11:10.140 --> 11:12.430
Honesty will never get us in.

11:12.430 --> 11:14.100
Well, what's your plan?

11:14.100 --> 11:17.290
All right, my plan is predicated on the assumption

11:17.290 --> 11:19.260
that they have a nurse's office

11:19.260 --> 11:22.980
and your willingness to be lightly stabbed.

11:30.380 --> 11:31.640
Who are you here to see?

11:31.640 --> 11:33.410
Uh, I'm just gonna tell you the truth.

11:33.410 --> 11:35.410
Oh, you are killing me.

11:35.980 --> 11:37.690
We don't have an appointment.

11:37.690 --> 11:39.830
We-we're just fans of Mr. Lucas's work,

11:39.830 --> 11:41.070
and we thought we'd take a shot

11:41.070 --> 11:43.260
and see if we could get in and look around.

11:43.260 --> 11:44.710
Sorry, guys, we get this a lot.

11:44.710 --> 11:45.820
Can't let you in.

11:45.820 --> 11:49.720
What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda?

11:50.800 --> 11:54.740
A recording session I must attend.

11:56.320 --> 11:57.670
I'm sorry, don't listen to him.

11:57.670 --> 11:59.190
We're actually physicists.

11:59.190 --> 12:01.000
We're giving a lecture at Berkeley later today.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.330
We just... we had some time to kill.

12:03.330 --> 12:05.220
Hey, listen, you seem like decent guys.

12:05.220 --> 12:06.550
I can't let you in,

12:06.550 --> 12:08.750
but I got some hats and T-shirts I can give you.

12:08.750 --> 12:10.650
Thank you so much.

12:11.250 --> 12:12.540
See?

12:12.540 --> 12:13.990
Maybe honesty is the best...

12:13.990 --> 12:15.300
What are you doing?

12:15.300 --> 12:16.730
Shedding the yoke of my oppressors,

12:16.730 --> 12:19.270
you blind, sad little man.

12:19.270 --> 12:20.680
Don't move!

12:20.680 --> 12:23.210
Code A-A-23, A-A-23.

12:23.210 --> 12:24.490
Copy.

12:24.490 --> 12:26.520
I can see the ranch, Leonard!

12:26.520 --> 12:29.020
Oh, it's rustic, it's lovely.

12:29.020 --> 12:33.050
I'd take a picture, but people are chasing me.

12:33.470 --> 12:34.720
I'm gonna make it...!

12:34.720 --> 12:36.020
I'm gonna make it!

12:36.020 --> 12:38.670
They have Tasers, but they wouldn't dare use...

12:43.170 --> 12:44.860
Come on, Raj.

12:44.860 --> 12:48.680
You are the King Kong of Ping-Pong.

12:48.680 --> 12:52.030
You are the menace of table tennis.

12:52.420 --> 12:55.350
Put her away, 'cause I don't have a third one.

12:56.410 --> 12:57.580
Yes!

12:58.680 --> 13:00.380
Rajesh eight, Penny four.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.150
Sorry, he's really good.

13:03.130 --> 13:04.530
Hey, Raj.

13:04.530 --> 13:06.020
if Howard can't keep the TARDIS,

13:06.020 --> 13:07.750
how great would it look at your place?

13:07.750 --> 13:08.410
What?

13:08.410 --> 13:10.590
Yeah, what?

13:11.130 --> 13:12.850
I don't know much about Doctor Who,

13:12.850 --> 13:16.390
but if, um, you were to put this right outside your front door

13:17.490 --> 13:18.960
and open up the back,

13:18.960 --> 13:21.190
it would be like your entire apartment was

13:21.190 --> 13:23.550
the inside of the TARDIS,

13:23.550 --> 13:24.820
which is pretty cool

13:24.820 --> 13:27.630
'cause on the show, the inside of the TARDIS

13:27.630 --> 13:29.730
is bigger than the outside.

13:30.380 --> 13:34.470
But then again, I don't know much about Doctor Who.

13:36.070 --> 13:37.260
Don't listen to her.

13:37.260 --> 13:40.240
You and I go way back-- we're like brothers.

13:40.660 --> 13:43.000
We are. We are.

13:44.860 --> 13:47.190
Oh, no! What a terrible serve!

13:49.090 --> 13:50.730
Sorry, brother.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.060
- Eight-five. - This is ridiculous.

13:52.060 --> 13:53.180
I want a new champion.

13:53.180 --> 13:55.810
Amy, were you serious about being able to serve?

13:55.810 --> 13:58.650
Uh, it-it's been a long time.

13:58.650 --> 14:00.220
I don't know.

14:00.220 --> 14:02.420
I'm probably pretty rusty.

14:06.860 --> 14:08.010
She's my champion!

14:08.010 --> 14:10.180
Well, if you can switch champions, so can I.

14:10.180 --> 14:11.670
- I want Raj. - Hey.

14:11.670 --> 14:13.180
Oh, come on, like you even care.

14:13.180 --> 14:14.600
I care!

14:14.600 --> 14:16.450
Oh, wait, no, I don't. Good luck, Raj.

14:18.870 --> 14:21.680
You know, I thought our friendship meant more to you.

14:22.270 --> 14:23.900
So did I.

14:31.340 --> 14:33.080
Do you think they're gonna call the police?

14:33.080 --> 14:34.390
I don't know.

14:35.720 --> 14:37.640
Maybe they'll call Imperial Officers to take us

14:37.640 --> 14:40.540
to a holding cell on the Death Star.

14:42.640 --> 14:46.410
Oh, I think that's below the pay grade of an Imperial Officer.

14:46.410 --> 14:47.500
Stormtroopers are really the ones who...

14:47.500 --> 14:49.630
Oh, shut up.

14:50.470 --> 14:51.900
He's right.

14:51.900 --> 14:54.040
Uh, Stormtroopers actually combine both the function

14:54.040 --> 14:56.830
of infantry and military police.

14:58.530 --> 15:00.410
Uh-huh, I'm normally very nice,

15:00.410 --> 15:02.880
but you shut up, too.

15:08.750 --> 15:10.870
So...

15:10.870 --> 15:12.970
what are you in for?

15:13.500 --> 15:17.340
Honestly, I just wanted to meet Mr. Lucas and say thank you.

15:17.340 --> 15:20.720
You know, growing up, the movies had such an impact on my life.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.690
I never really fit in anywhere.

15:22.690 --> 15:25.010
Till I discovered the worlds he created

15:25.010 --> 15:27.490
and finally found a place where I belong.

15:27.880 --> 15:30.410
But why are you here?

15:31.170 --> 15:32.630
Oh, I, uh, I hopped a fence,

15:32.630 --> 15:33.820
and they caught me in the sculpture gallery

15:33.820 --> 15:36.830
making out with a Chewbacca statue.

15:42.980 --> 15:44.540
Excuse me.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.630
Leonard,

15:54.960 --> 15:57.430
they have a sculpture gallery.

16:01.560 --> 16:02.980
All right, I talked to my supervisor,

16:02.980 --> 16:04.960
and we're gonna let you go with a warning.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.150
But if you ever come back,

16:06.150 --> 16:07.920
we will call the police and press charges.

16:07.920 --> 16:08.890
We understand.

16:08.890 --> 16:10.170
Thank you so much.

16:10.480 --> 16:11.380
Uh, what about me?

16:11.380 --> 16:13.360
No, you're not going anywhere, kissy face.

16:13.960 --> 16:14.800
Let's go.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.350
I have to take your picture to post at the guard gate.

16:17.820 --> 16:19.650
Uh, one question about that picture.

16:19.650 --> 16:22.090
Can it be with George Lucas?

16:23.840 --> 16:26.000
Ooh, grumpy you are.

16:31.060 --> 16:33.590
Okay, this is the match that decides it all.

16:33.590 --> 16:34.800
First to 11 wins.

16:34.800 --> 16:37.900
Serve switches every five points.

16:37.900 --> 16:39.650
And just so you know, when this started,

16:39.650 --> 16:42.210
I was going to put the TARDIS in a discreet corner of the house,

16:42.210 --> 16:43.450
but I've since turned mean,

16:43.450 --> 16:45.270
and now it's going right in the middle of the living room

16:45.270 --> 16:47.370
on a rotating platform with a sign that says "Suck it".

16:47.370 --> 16:48.790
Game on.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.120
Except...

16:52.120 --> 16:53.950
Raj is gonna win.

16:53.950 --> 16:55.410
Isn't that right, Raj?

16:55.730 --> 16:57.820
Uh, yeah, I mean, her serve was pretty good.

16:57.820 --> 16:59.380
Come on, get in her head.

16:59.380 --> 17:00.100
Be intimidating.

17:00.100 --> 17:02.140
Okay, uh...

17:02.480 --> 17:04.060
I'm gonna own you, bitch!

17:05.570 --> 17:07.080
That's not nice.

17:08.150 --> 17:09.770
Let's just play.

17:13.570 --> 17:15.030
One-zero.

17:15.450 --> 17:16.550
Two.

17:16.980 --> 17:18.170
Three.

17:18.700 --> 17:19.930
Four.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.360
Five-nothing.

17:22.360 --> 17:24.440
Wait, did you play badminton

17:24.440 --> 17:26.640
or sad-minton?

17:27.700 --> 17:29.910
Don't listen to him-- all she's got is a serve.

17:29.910 --> 17:33.040
Now, grab a fresh tampon and put her away.

17:33.040 --> 17:33.790
Wha...?

17:33.790 --> 17:35.400
A-And that's not offensive?

17:35.400 --> 17:36.430
Where's the line?

17:36.430 --> 17:38.520
It's in your purse. Play.

17:41.600 --> 17:42.600
One-five.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.580
Two-five.

17:45.330 --> 17:46.600
Three-five.

17:47.040 --> 17:48.360
Four-five.

17:49.190 --> 17:50.800
Five-five!

17:52.170 --> 17:53.150
Six.

17:53.590 --> 17:54.730
Seven.

17:54.730 --> 17:56.080
Eight.

17:56.530 --> 17:57.830
Nine.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.480
Ten-five!

18:02.420 --> 18:03.790
Six.

18:05.100 --> 18:05.980
Seven.

18:07.330 --> 18:08.230
Eight.

18:08.880 --> 18:09.840
Nine.

18:10.870 --> 18:12.350
Ten-ten!

18:16.450 --> 18:18.970
Well, that was an exciting 40 seconds.

18:20.380 --> 18:22.910
It was, and now the serve is back to you,

18:22.910 --> 18:24.830
and the game is over.

18:25.490 --> 18:27.850
You know, Amy, I, uh...

18:28.200 --> 18:30.490
can't help but wonder how Sheldon would react

18:30.490 --> 18:33.510
if the TARDIS was at your place.

18:33.510 --> 18:36.020
Don't listen to her, just hit the ball.

18:36.020 --> 18:37.650
Keep talking.

18:42.390 --> 18:44.630
If this doesn't get him into your bedroom,

18:45.130 --> 18:46.730
nothing will.

18:52.810 --> 18:53.950
Are you still mad at me?

18:53.950 --> 18:58.250
Yes, we missed our lecture, we were almost arrested,

18:58.250 --> 18:59.910
and you got me locked in a room with a man

18:59.910 --> 19:03.190
who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed Wookie.

19:05.140 --> 19:08.060
Boy, some people are just glass-half-empty.

19:08.510 --> 19:10.060
The glass is empty, Sheldon.

19:10.060 --> 19:11.200
It's completely empty.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.270
If you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst,

19:13.270 --> 19:15.230
he would be dead, do you know why?

19:15.230 --> 19:18.840
Before I answer, was he a smoker?

19:23.100 --> 19:25.350
I think you're looking at this all wrong.

19:25.350 --> 19:27.880
Fine, then tell me how I should be looking at it.

19:27.880 --> 19:32.390
Well, not only did we go to Skywalker Ranch, we got in.

19:32.390 --> 19:34.680
And no one we know can say that.

19:34.680 --> 19:37.860
And for all the times you find me irritating,

19:37.860 --> 19:41.610
today you got to watch someone shoot me with a Taser.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.760
That part was pretty good.

19:47.280 --> 19:48.600
See?

19:49.150 --> 19:51.730
You did flop around a lot.

19:52.840 --> 19:53.950
I'll take your word for it.

19:53.950 --> 19:56.710
I was too busy trying not to defecate.

19:58.940 --> 20:02.530
You know, when they were escorting us to the detaining room,

20:02.530 --> 20:04.180
I looked through a door,

20:04.180 --> 20:06.400
and I'm pretty sure I saw a display case

20:06.400 --> 20:08.480
with the Ark of the Covenant.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.650
- That's amazing. - I know.

20:10.650 --> 20:14.710
And I saw Jabba the Hutt riding by on a motorcycle.

20:14.710 --> 20:16.610
Although that was right after the Tasing,

20:16.610 --> 20:18.590
so who can say for sure?

20:19.830 --> 20:22.500
I-I guess this could count as an adventure.

20:22.500 --> 20:23.960
It was.

20:23.960 --> 20:26.710
And even though we're not allowed back there,

20:26.710 --> 20:29.470
they can never take today away from us.

20:29.470 --> 20:31.660
Unlike my sense of smell,

20:31.660 --> 20:34.310
which hasn't returned since the Tasing.

20:36.950 --> 20:38.350
No, I got nothing.

20:44.890 --> 20:47.880
Amy, the Daleks are right on my tail!

20:47.880 --> 20:50.020
Quick, we need to reset the time circuits.

20:50.350 --> 20:53.770
Oh, no, I left my sonic screwdriver behind.

20:58.060 --> 20:59.910
Really should have thought this through.
