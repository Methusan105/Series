00:03.510 --> 00:04.840
Hello.

00:05.250 --> 00:06.830
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

00:06.830 --> 00:10.370
And welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun with Flags,

00:11.760 --> 00:14.250
the Final Episode Flagtacular.

00:15.900 --> 00:18.150
I knew it was coming. Still scary.

00:18.820 --> 00:21.630
Now, I'm sure you're thinking, "The final episode?

00:21.630 --> 00:24.480
who will stand between us and flag ignorance"

00:25.110 --> 00:26.990
I know I was thinking that.

00:27.490 --> 00:30.920
Is this a show on flags or mind reading?

00:31.530 --> 00:34.680
But the truth is I can no longer balance a full-time career,

00:34.680 --> 00:37.470
a popular Internet show, and a girlfriend.

00:37.470 --> 00:40.990
And he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board.

00:42.460 --> 00:45.750
So as they say, all good things must come to an end.

00:45.750 --> 00:48.950
After only 232 episodes.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.230
233 if we include the one

00:51.230 --> 00:54.370
somebody forgot to press record on.

00:55.060 --> 00:56.390
You said you weren't gonna bring that up.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.690
And you said you pressed record.

01:00.510 --> 01:02.850
Anyway, please sit back, relax,

01:02.850 --> 01:05.320
and join us as we take our final lap...

01:07.600 --> 01:10.050
...as indicated by the waving of this racing flag.

01:10.050 --> 01:12.720
And, of course, white flags can also represent surrender,

01:12.720 --> 01:15.750
the Stewards of Gondor, and the Japanese Minamoto clan,

01:15.750 --> 01:18.420
but I'm sure you remember that from episode 62,

01:18.420 --> 01:21.700
"White Flags: Who's Wavin' 'Em and Why"

01:23.000 --> 01:23.930
That was a good one.

01:23.930 --> 01:25.870
It was so good.

01:52.420 --> 01:55.090
You know, I thought cleaning out a dead professor's office

01:55.090 --> 01:56.750
was gonna just be boring,

01:56.750 --> 01:58.950
but then I found his dentures

01:58.950 --> 02:02.210
and realized it's also gross.

02:03.480 --> 02:06.430
Doesn't Professor Abbott's family want any of this stuff?

02:06.430 --> 02:07.740
I don't think he had a family.

02:07.740 --> 02:09.370
- That's rough. - I know.

02:09.900 --> 02:11.290
You can spend your whole life working,

02:11.290 --> 02:14.960
and at the end all that's left are some papers in a box.

02:15.290 --> 02:16.950
Makes you think.

02:17.850 --> 02:19.690
Oh, well.

02:20.350 --> 02:22.410
Hey. Hey, we're supposed to look through all this stuff

02:22.410 --> 02:24.170
before we throw it away in case it's important.

02:24.170 --> 02:26.890
I-I did. It's all outdated or disproved.

02:26.890 --> 02:30.560
I don't know. This old pen kind of proves gravity.

02:30.560 --> 02:33.880
When I tilt it, her bathing suit falls right off.

02:34.650 --> 02:36.830
Oh, my dad used to have a pen like that.

02:36.830 --> 02:39.610
I dated it all through sixth grade.

02:40.330 --> 02:41.150
It still feels weird

02:41.150 --> 02:43.050
just throwing away his work like this.

02:43.050 --> 02:44.200
Don't feel bad.

02:44.200 --> 02:47.030
Someday, someone will be throwing out your work, too.

02:48.330 --> 02:51.580
That someone was Sheldon, and the day was yesterday.

02:52.900 --> 02:54.220
Hey, look at this.

02:55.060 --> 02:58.570
"Dear Roger, to be opened upon your first great discovery.

02:58.570 --> 03:00.210
Love, Mom."

03:00.700 --> 03:02.640
Wow, look at the date.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.620
He saved this 50 years and never got to open it.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.420
That's intense.

03:08.420 --> 03:10.510
Poor Roger Abbott.

03:11.610 --> 03:15.890
Roger Abbott sounds just like Roger Rabbit.

03:16.680 --> 03:19.880
Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott, Roger Rabbit.

03:19.880 --> 03:21.540
Oh, my God, Leonard, I know he's dead,

03:21.540 --> 03:23.630
but try it. It's fun!

03:23.630 --> 03:26.040
Roger Abbott, Roger Rabbit...

03:28.540 --> 03:29.430
Penny!

03:30.160 --> 03:31.820
Oh, my rookie of the year.

03:31.820 --> 03:34.480
Oh, Dan. My boss who didn't want to hire me

03:34.480 --> 03:36.440
and now's a little hug machine.

03:37.190 --> 03:41.010
Oh, look at you. Brand-new and already the third best sales rep.

03:41.010 --> 03:42.850
- Why don't you come over to my table. - Yes. I'll be right there.

03:42.850 --> 03:44.860
Bernadette's just parking the car.

03:44.860 --> 03:46.550
Oh, good.

03:47.620 --> 03:50.060
Bernadette. Cute, sweet...

03:50.060 --> 03:52.640
vicious little Bernadette.

03:53.280 --> 03:54.730
Come on. She's not that bad.

03:54.730 --> 03:55.500
Oh, yeah?

03:55.500 --> 03:58.020
At the company picnic she yelled at me and my grandson

03:58.020 --> 04:00.310
for losing the three-legged race.

04:00.310 --> 04:04.860
I mean, he still calls her "That mean kid with the big boobies."

04:05.910 --> 04:07.730
I know she can be a little intense, but, I swear,

04:07.730 --> 04:09.810
she is so sweet once you get past all the...

04:09.810 --> 04:11.090
Hey, what are you talking about?

04:11.090 --> 04:14.190
We were just talking about how much we love working with you.

04:14.190 --> 04:15.280
Isn't that right?

04:15.280 --> 04:16.740
Dan?

04:20.350 --> 04:22.550
Over the years here at Fun With Flags,

04:22.550 --> 04:26.200
we've had an opportunity to learn, laugh, wonder...

04:26.200 --> 04:29.790
And, yes, even shed a tear or two.

04:30.660 --> 04:33.580
Like when you do a two-hour Fourth of July spectacular

04:33.580 --> 04:36.100
and it doesn't get recorded.

04:37.410 --> 04:39.330
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?

04:39.330 --> 04:41.440
How about 4,000.

04:42.470 --> 04:45.900
One for every domino I set up to make that American flag.

04:47.490 --> 04:49.830
Please enjoy these highlights.

04:51.540 --> 04:54.230
Crikey! What flag do we have today?

04:58.230 --> 05:00.380
Australia, mate!

05:03.910 --> 05:08.330
And now it's time for the speed round of Flag or Not a Flag.

05:08.330 --> 05:10.500
Flag. Flag.

05:10.910 --> 05:12.980
Not a flag. Flag.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.020
I am crushing this.

05:20.170 --> 05:23.880
Say, Betsy Ross, what you working on?

05:23.880 --> 05:26.440
I have no idea.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.970
Because the story of me sewing the first American flag

05:30.970 --> 05:33.670
is unsupported poppycock.

05:34.470 --> 05:36.400
Then who did sew it, hmm?

05:36.400 --> 05:38.150
Don't ask me.

05:38.150 --> 05:41.810
I'm just a simple seamstress whose descendants are...

05:41.810 --> 05:44.160
out to make a quick buck!

05:51.830 --> 05:53.670
Fancy a dip, my dear?

05:53.670 --> 05:55.250
I do.

05:57.680 --> 05:59.850
Wait, that purple flag indicates

05:59.850 --> 06:02.840
that marine pests, such as jellyfish, are present.

06:02.840 --> 06:06.030
Wow, that flag is a lifesaver.

06:06.030 --> 06:07.170
No.

06:08.580 --> 06:10.250
This is.

06:11.970 --> 06:13.960
Stop looking at my legs.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.290
Not a flag. Flag.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.080
Flag. Not a flag.

06:20.530 --> 06:21.410
Flag.

06:21.900 --> 06:22.990
Crap.

06:25.540 --> 06:26.960
When stuff like this gets me down,

06:26.960 --> 06:28.380
you know what I like to do?

06:28.380 --> 06:31.600
Sing "Hakuna Matata" Like an eight-year-old girl?

06:32.060 --> 06:33.400
Wrong, smarty-pants.

06:33.400 --> 06:36.570
It's "Everything Is Awesome" From The Lego Movie.

06:38.520 --> 06:39.660
Look at these notebooks.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.810
They're full of pages and pages of data.

06:41.810 --> 06:43.690
He clearly spent years on this.

06:43.690 --> 06:46.420
Oh, it's just columns of random numbers. Toss it.

06:46.420 --> 06:49.360
Well, but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him?

06:49.360 --> 06:50.860
What if... what if this is the thing

06:50.860 --> 06:53.420
that would've finally let him open that bottle of champagne?

06:53.420 --> 06:56.040
Maybe he didn't know what to pair champagne with.

06:56.040 --> 06:59.830
Strawberries, caviar, oysters. All good choices.

07:01.060 --> 07:02.260
Yeah, that look right there

07:02.260 --> 07:05.260
is why people eat before they come to your parties.

07:06.240 --> 07:08.430
This has to mean something.

07:09.070 --> 07:12.200
Well, there's no discernible pattern that I can see,

07:12.200 --> 07:14.850
but it shouldn't be too hard to run the numbers and check.

07:14.850 --> 07:17.200
Well, maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.020
Sure. We could try multiple regressions

07:19.020 --> 07:21.540
with varying physical and experimental constants.

07:21.540 --> 07:23.820
Oh, we could run a pattern-matching algorithm

07:23.820 --> 07:26.090
against well-known unsolved physics problems.

07:26.090 --> 07:29.050
Ooh, it might be a substitution cipher.

07:29.050 --> 07:30.780
We could start with basic cryptanalysis.

07:30.780 --> 07:33.550
Or we could talk to this guy he used to share an office with.

07:35.860 --> 07:37.500
Oh, let's do that.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.000
Because you don't know how to do cryptanalysis, do you?

07:41.000 --> 07:43.520
I'm not even sure if it's the right word.

07:52.050 --> 07:54.320
So, Dan, you have a grandson.

07:54.320 --> 07:55.880
- How old is he? - Seven.

07:55.880 --> 07:58.680
Oh, yeah. I remember him from the picnic.

07:59.430 --> 08:02.060
He was the one crying like a wuss the whole time.

08:03.460 --> 08:06.490
I heard he was being picked on by a mean kid.

08:06.490 --> 08:08.340
Just builds character.

08:08.340 --> 08:10.250
Like my dad said, "Nobody likes a crybaby

08:10.250 --> 08:12.530
except their mommies and Democrats."

08:13.880 --> 08:15.740
I need another drink.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.420
What's his problem?

08:18.420 --> 08:20.500
I don't know. Maybe he didn't like the fact

08:20.500 --> 08:22.380
that you called his grandson a wuss.

08:22.380 --> 08:25.400
Well, I didn't think you were supposed to say "sissy" anymore.

08:26.780 --> 08:29.200
Okay, look, I know what a good person you are,

08:29.200 --> 08:32.430
but sometimes people think you might come off a little harsh.

08:32.430 --> 08:33.560
What?

08:33.560 --> 08:36.470
I'm, like, the sweetest person I know.

08:37.190 --> 08:40.930
Look at me. I should be in a tree baking cookies.

08:41.750 --> 08:43.730
Yes, but once in a while,

08:43.730 --> 08:46.660
people think you're a little mean.

08:46.660 --> 08:47.810
Oh, yeah?

08:47.810 --> 08:49.750
You one of those people?

08:51.660 --> 08:52.860
No. No, no, no.

08:52.860 --> 08:54.840
I-I think the cookie thing.

08:59.360 --> 09:00.900
Action.

09:00.900 --> 09:02.560
Welcome back.

09:02.560 --> 09:05.500
Our guest today is a returning fan favorite.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.600
He puts the reading in your rainbow,

09:07.600 --> 09:09.240
the Geordi in your La Forge,

09:09.240 --> 09:11.090
and the Kunta in your Kinte,

09:11.090 --> 09:13.100
Mr. LeVar Burton.

09:18.460 --> 09:20.450
Thank you, Sheldon. Now, remember our deal...

09:20.450 --> 09:24.330
You do this, I delete your contact information.

09:24.800 --> 09:25.840
While...

09:25.840 --> 09:28.000
While you watch me do it.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.680
Great. Happy to be back.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.220
Well, since you're here,

09:31.220 --> 09:33.750
I'd like to get your opinion on something.

09:33.750 --> 09:35.800
In honor of Black History Month,

09:35.800 --> 09:38.040
I portrayed George Washington Carver

09:38.040 --> 09:43.540
in a loving tribute that my roommate called "wildly racist"

09:43.540 --> 09:44.710
What do you think?

09:44.710 --> 09:47.310
Hi. My name is George.

09:47.310 --> 09:49.540
Oh, hell, no!

09:52.480 --> 09:53.440
You heard him, Leonard.

09:53.440 --> 09:56.360
No, it's not racist.

10:02.430 --> 10:03.840
Are we sure this is the place?

10:03.840 --> 10:05.860
The doorman said this is the right building.

10:05.860 --> 10:07.340
I think if you're pulling up your pants,

10:07.340 --> 10:09.280
you're not a doorman.

10:10.750 --> 10:11.650
Who is it?

10:11.650 --> 10:13.860
Uh, I'm looking for a Professor Sharpe?

10:13.860 --> 10:15.070
Hold on.

10:16.760 --> 10:19.230
- Can I help you? - Hi. We're from the university.

10:19.230 --> 10:21.610
We're trying to get some information about Professor Abbott.

10:21.610 --> 10:22.760
We were cleaning out his office

10:22.760 --> 10:24.980
and found these books full of numbers.

10:24.980 --> 10:26.330
Any chance you know what it is?

10:26.330 --> 10:28.230
Yes, he was always working on this.

10:28.230 --> 10:31.340
I was thinking it might be some sort of interstellar coordinate system,

10:31.340 --> 10:33.400
maybe an updated version of Hubble's law.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.860
I keep seeing the number 90 repeating.

10:35.860 --> 10:38.820
That could be the angle of perturbation of a distant galaxy.

10:38.820 --> 10:41.280
It's the number of calories in a yogurt.

10:42.510 --> 10:44.100
That's his food diary.

10:44.540 --> 10:45.140
Really?

10:45.140 --> 10:46.750
Yeah, he wrote down everything he ever ate.

10:46.750 --> 10:49.040
He was convinced that calorie restriction

10:49.040 --> 10:50.610
was the key to living forever.

10:50.610 --> 10:52.280
Does it work?

10:52.860 --> 10:53.790
Seriously?

10:53.790 --> 10:56.850
Well, he could have been hit by a bus. You don't know.

10:58.410 --> 10:59.980
Sorry it's not more interesting.

10:59.980 --> 11:01.580
On the bright side, you didn't have to listen

11:01.580 --> 11:04.260
to his stomach growl for 35 years.

11:04.260 --> 11:06.750
So, was there anything that Professor Abbott worked on

11:06.750 --> 11:10.140
during his life that came close to an accomplishment?

11:10.140 --> 11:14.410
To be honest, his research never amounted to anything.

11:14.410 --> 11:15.320
Oh. You were his colleague.

11:15.320 --> 11:16.480
How did your research turn out?

11:16.480 --> 11:17.230
Great.

11:17.230 --> 11:20.780
Hey, this is the apartment you get when you win a Nobel.

11:22.370 --> 11:23.980
Well, you could be very frugal.

11:23.980 --> 11:26.800
I'm getting a little tired of everybody's sarcasm.

11:30.410 --> 11:31.850
I'm not a bully.

11:31.850 --> 11:33.700
I mean, maybe I come off a little strong,

11:33.700 --> 11:35.710
but that's only because my dad raised me to be tough

11:35.710 --> 11:37.380
and not to take crap from anybody.

11:37.380 --> 11:38.970
No. That's fine,

11:38.970 --> 11:40.550
but there's a difference between being tough

11:40.550 --> 11:42.290
and telling your friend her new pants

11:42.290 --> 11:44.600
look like a saggy diaper.

11:46.910 --> 11:48.390
I did say that, didn't I?

11:48.390 --> 11:49.260
Yeah, you did.

11:49.260 --> 11:51.970
I felt so self-conscious, I had to return them.

11:52.960 --> 11:54.860
Where? To Babies R Us?

11:55.990 --> 11:57.780
You're doing it again!

11:57.780 --> 11:59.410
Okay, sorry. Can we just go?

11:59.410 --> 12:00.800
I feel like everybody hates me.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.340
Oh, come on, they don't hate you, all right?

12:02.340 --> 12:04.180
They're just a little intimidated.

12:04.180 --> 12:05.270
All you need to do is show everyone

12:05.270 --> 12:06.820
how sweet you really are.

12:06.820 --> 12:08.570
- I think I'd rather go. - No, come on.

12:08.570 --> 12:09.870
You are not going anywhere, all right?

12:09.870 --> 12:13.250
I am here for you, and we are gonna fix this together.

12:13.250 --> 12:13.980
Thank you.

12:13.980 --> 12:16.100
Even though your dress is ugly.

12:19.670 --> 12:22.050
Well, my little Flag-keteers,

12:22.050 --> 12:25.970
it looks like the last episode of Fun with Flags is at an end.

12:26.370 --> 12:27.890
If I could,

12:27.890 --> 12:31.670
I would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole

12:31.670 --> 12:33.560
and salute you.

12:34.510 --> 12:38.180
And if you touched the ground, burn you.

12:38.180 --> 12:39.480
I'd like to take a moment

12:39.480 --> 12:42.050
to personally thank Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler,

12:42.050 --> 12:44.010
who you may or may not know

12:44.010 --> 12:47.180
is the first woman to co-host a flag

12:47.180 --> 12:50.970
or banner-related Internet info-tainment show.

12:51.890 --> 12:54.670
Take that, glass ceiling.

12:55.550 --> 12:58.430
And if I may get serious for a moment,

13:00.010 --> 13:03.260
hosting this show has been...

13:03.260 --> 13:06.070
one crazy ride.

13:06.870 --> 13:09.600
With all its ups and downs,

13:09.600 --> 13:12.440
I wouldn't give it up for the world.

13:13.310 --> 13:15.750
Except for now, when I'm giving it up.

13:19.010 --> 13:21.660
Before I sign off, I'd, uh...

13:21.980 --> 13:25.960
I'd like to share with you all one last use for a white flag.

13:27.220 --> 13:29.500
It's good for times like this.

13:32.490 --> 13:33.920
Good night.

13:34.910 --> 13:36.080
Cut.

13:37.240 --> 13:39.350
Sheldon...

13:41.230 --> 13:42.460
that was beautiful.

13:42.460 --> 13:43.580
If you didn't press record...

13:43.580 --> 13:45.900
I pressed it!

13:50.770 --> 13:53.200
Well, that's it.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.990
That's the end of Roger Abbott.

13:58.390 --> 14:01.350
And we still don't know who framed him.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.490
I still keep thinking about how an entire life

14:05.490 --> 14:08.040
can seemingly amount to nothing.

14:08.040 --> 14:11.030
I guess the sad truth is,

14:11.030 --> 14:14.190
not everyone will accomplish something great.

14:14.580 --> 14:17.010
Some of us may just have to find meaning

14:17.010 --> 14:21.380
in the little moments that make up life.

14:22.080 --> 14:24.190
That's a nice way of looking at it.

14:24.700 --> 14:25.680
Yeah for you, not for me.

14:25.680 --> 14:27.960
I went to space. I'm covered.

14:30.930 --> 14:32.070
You know what?

14:32.070 --> 14:35.130
This bottle was meant to celebrate an achievement.

14:35.130 --> 14:36.500
Let's make a pact.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.820
When one of us gets their first big breakthrough,

14:38.820 --> 14:41.610
we'll celebrate by opening this bottle of champagne

14:41.610 --> 14:43.940
and toasting Professor Abbott.

14:43.940 --> 14:44.670
I love that.

14:44.670 --> 14:46.310
Yeah, me, too.

14:46.310 --> 14:47.750
Then, of course,

14:47.750 --> 14:49.580
rubbing our success in Sheldon's face.

14:49.580 --> 14:51.240
- Oh, well, that's the best part. - Oh, yeah.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.980
Dan, could I talk to you for a minute?

14:59.670 --> 15:00.800
Sure, go ahead.

15:01.880 --> 15:03.260
Just want you to know I didn't mean

15:03.260 --> 15:04.760
to be rude about your grandson.

15:04.760 --> 15:06.340
No, it's okay.

15:06.340 --> 15:08.000
No, it's not.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.090
Penny told me that everyone's scared of me.

15:10.830 --> 15:12.770
What? What?

15:12.770 --> 15:14.120
Why would she say that?

15:14.120 --> 15:16.330
- You know she drinks, right? - What?

15:17.520 --> 15:19.830
No, she's right, and I just want you to know

15:19.830 --> 15:21.990
that from now on, I'm gonna be much more sensitive.

15:21.990 --> 15:24.450
I don't want anyone walking on eggshells around me.

15:24.450 --> 15:26.590
Oh, well, okay, then, uh,

15:26.590 --> 15:28.690
one thing I've been meaning to tell you

15:28.690 --> 15:31.660
is that the company is gonna stop paying for our coffee.

15:31.660 --> 15:33.530
No problem. When does that start?

15:33.530 --> 15:35.120
Five months ago.

15:35.800 --> 15:36.970
- What?! - Yeah.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.600
Who's been paying for my coffee?

15:38.600 --> 15:39.650
All of us.

15:39.650 --> 15:41.190
Yeah. It comes from the swear jar

15:41.190 --> 15:43.550
we put money in when you curse.

15:46.510 --> 15:48.180
What else don't I know about?

15:48.180 --> 15:51.650
- Uh, well, you know your private bathroom? - Yeah?

15:51.650 --> 15:53.920
That was supposed to be for the whole floor.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.040
- You're kidding. - No, no. It's okay.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.160
It only really affected wheelchair Kathy,

15:58.160 --> 16:00.600
and she's back in the hospital now,

16:00.600 --> 16:02.200
so it all worked out.

16:03.770 --> 16:05.320
I feel so bad.

16:05.320 --> 16:08.450
Well, then, maybe you shouldn't have named her "Wheelchair Kathy."

16:10.120 --> 16:11.760
Oh, my God!

16:11.760 --> 16:15.000
I thought everybody liked me, but I'm just a monster.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.950
But a cute one, like that, uh, eyeball guy in Monsters, Inc.

16:19.870 --> 16:21.620
No, I'm the worst.

16:21.620 --> 16:23.450
I'm a terrible person.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.920
Come on, don't cry. It's okay.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.150
It's not okay.

16:27.150 --> 16:29.820
How can I even work here anymore? Oh.

16:29.820 --> 16:31.460
- Because this company needs you. - It's fine.

16:31.460 --> 16:33.190
We don't mind paying for the coffee.

16:33.190 --> 16:35.590
I can't let you do that.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.230
Maybe we could get you

16:37.230 --> 16:39.710
an espresso machine for your office.

16:39.990 --> 16:43.430
- I guess that would be all right. - All right.

16:44.660 --> 16:47.660
See? You don't have to be mean to get what you want.

16:47.660 --> 16:49.350
You're right.

16:49.350 --> 16:52.780
Now where did we land on my bathroom?

16:57.580 --> 16:58.430
Hi.

16:58.690 --> 16:59.560
Hello.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.250
How come you're up so late?

17:01.250 --> 17:04.650
I posted the last episode of Fun with Flags hours ago,

17:04.650 --> 17:08.180
and not a single person cared enough to comment.

17:09.610 --> 17:11.590
All that effort for nothing.

17:12.790 --> 17:14.170
I know how you feel.

17:14.170 --> 17:16.400
I spent the day throwing out a man's entire career,

17:16.400 --> 17:18.340
and all that's left is an old bottle of champagne

17:18.340 --> 17:20.700
and a naked lady pen that Raj took

17:20.700 --> 17:22.730
when he thought no one was looking.

17:24.910 --> 17:26.660
It's not the same thing.

17:26.660 --> 17:29.080
I don't think you know how I feel at all.

17:29.080 --> 17:31.110
Sad?

17:33.010 --> 17:34.940
You do get me.

17:38.010 --> 17:39.380
Someone left a comment.

17:39.380 --> 17:40.660
Yeah. What did they say?

17:40.660 --> 17:42.620
"Too bad your show is done.

17:42.620 --> 17:44.230
I kind of liked it."

17:44.230 --> 17:47.180
Leonard, did you hear that?

17:48.070 --> 17:50.910
Oh, the people are heartbroken!

17:51.830 --> 17:54.760
I can't take this away from the world!

17:54.760 --> 17:57.590
Fun with Flags is back!

17:58.900 --> 18:00.050
Congratulations.

18:00.050 --> 18:01.780
Let's celebrate!

18:04.860 --> 18:07.080
Sheldon, that wasn't for you!

18:07.080 --> 18:08.590
Oh, no, I'm not going to drink it.

18:08.590 --> 18:10.930
I just wanted to hear the pop.

18:11.900 --> 18:14.640
Yeah, I knew it was coming. Still scary.

18:22.690 --> 18:23.820
LeVar Burton?

18:24.340 --> 18:25.550
LeVar Burton!

18:26.100 --> 18:27.490
LeVar Burton!

18:29.860 --> 18:31.410
What are you doing here?

18:31.410 --> 18:33.220
You told me not to call,

18:33.220 --> 18:35.400
and I didn't know how else to give you the good news.

18:35.400 --> 18:36.970
Fun with Flags is back,

18:36.970 --> 18:38.970
and you can be in the next episode.

18:38.970 --> 18:40.290
Wil Wheaton said, get a gate.

18:40.290 --> 18:42.180
- I don't know why I didn't get a gate. - You...

18:43.710 --> 18:45.450
At least listen to the premise.

18:45.450 --> 18:47.420
Since you were born in Germany,

18:47.420 --> 18:50.200
I thought we could talk about German flags.

18:50.590 --> 18:54.700
How do you feel about dressing up like a swastika?
