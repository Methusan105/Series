00:03.540 --> 00:05.180
It's, like, the best one they make,

00:05.180 --> 00:06.630
I just can't get it to work.

00:06.630 --> 00:07.050
I'll figure it out.

00:07.380 --> 00:10.500
It streams HD video straight to your phone while it's flying.

00:10.500 --> 00:11.630
Nice.

00:11.630 --> 00:15.040
Where were you when I was single?

00:16.990 --> 00:19.400
Okay, we should leave in about an hour. You all packed?

00:19.400 --> 00:21.920
Uh, yeah, I just need to throw in a few last minute things--

00:21.920 --> 00:24.390
you know, makeup, underwear, clothes.

00:25.530 --> 00:27.600
If your bathroom floor counts as a carry-on,

00:27.600 --> 00:29.640
you're packed.

00:30.150 --> 00:32.710
Leonard, have you ever given a high school commencement speech before?

00:32.710 --> 00:34.770
Nope. It's pretty exciting.

00:34.770 --> 00:37.360
Aren't you afraid of being blinded?

00:37.360 --> 00:38.910
How would I be blinded?

00:38.910 --> 00:40.270
At the end of the ceremony,

00:40.270 --> 00:43.610
all the students throw those pointy hats in the air.

00:44.350 --> 00:47.650
It's all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye.

00:48.540 --> 00:50.430
I'll take my chances.

00:50.430 --> 00:51.270
Fine.

00:51.270 --> 00:55.150
I wonder if they make "I told you so" cards in braille.

00:56.240 --> 00:58.270
Look, the problem with commencement speeches

00:58.270 --> 01:00.160
is that they're boring.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.770
Ooh, do you own a T-shirt cannon?

01:03.300 --> 01:05.170
Why would he own a T-shirt cannon?

01:05.170 --> 01:07.210
I don't know. Why do I own one?

01:08.290 --> 01:09.260
I think it's really nice

01:09.260 --> 01:11.260
that you're sharing this experience with Penny.

01:11.260 --> 01:12.650
Mm, I thought it'd be fun

01:12.650 --> 01:14.760
to show her my old stomping grounds.

01:14.760 --> 01:18.010
I even know the exact spot where they used to stomp me.

01:19.150 --> 01:21.740
Well, now you get to go back as a successful scientist.

01:21.740 --> 01:23.280
With a beautiful girl on your arm.

01:23.280 --> 01:26.240
And a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball.

01:53.750 --> 01:55.120
How'd you get ready so fast?

01:55.120 --> 01:56.150
Oh, I pack light.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.950
Once, I got through an entire spring break

01:57.950 --> 02:00.970
with nothing but a long T-shirt and a belt.

02:01.740 --> 02:03.010
Why did you need a belt?

02:03.010 --> 02:05.660
It's called an evening look.

02:06.470 --> 02:08.250
I've never been to New Jersey before.

02:08.250 --> 02:10.350
It gets a bad rap from shows

02:10.350 --> 02:12.590
like Jersey Shore and Real Housewives.

02:12.590 --> 02:13.680
So it's not really like that?

02:13.680 --> 02:15.630
No, it's like that.

02:17.330 --> 02:19.030
Well, I'm excited to show you around.

02:19.030 --> 02:20.960
You think we'll have time to visit your mom over there?

02:20.960 --> 02:21.700
Yes.

02:21.700 --> 02:24.060
We'll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press,

02:24.060 --> 02:26.170
but I'm not doing that either.

02:30.980 --> 02:32.140
I just got an alert.

02:32.140 --> 02:33.740
Our flight's been canceled.

02:33.740 --> 02:34.730
What?

02:34.730 --> 02:37.830
Yeah, looks like there's a big storm all up the East Coast.

02:37.830 --> 02:40.070
Well, can we get on another airline?

02:40.070 --> 02:41.470
I don't think so.

02:41.470 --> 02:43.970
So, that's it? We're not going?

02:43.970 --> 02:45.320
I guess not.

02:45.320 --> 02:47.440
- Well, that sucks. - Yeah.

02:47.440 --> 02:49.560
I worked hard on that speech, too.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.260
Oh. You could tell it to me.

02:51.260 --> 02:52.940
Oh, thank you, but I'm okay.

02:52.940 --> 02:53.910
Are you sure?

02:53.910 --> 02:55.520
I could pretend I'm a high school cheerleader

02:55.520 --> 02:58.970
who can't control herself around esteemed alumni.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.550
Greetings, distinguished cheerleaders.

03:06.070 --> 03:08.390
Okay, the WiFi extender is on, the camera's on,

03:08.390 --> 03:09.590
they're both on the same network;

03:09.590 --> 03:10.810
we should be getting an image.

03:10.810 --> 03:13.330
All I see is a black screen.

03:13.330 --> 03:15.730
And my own reflection.

03:16.170 --> 03:18.450
I look sad.

03:19.870 --> 03:21.390
Maybe we should recalibrate it.

03:21.390 --> 03:22.320
All right.

03:22.320 --> 03:25.000
Step one: rapidly flip the calibration switch

03:25.000 --> 03:26.430
from the fully up to the fully down

03:26.430 --> 03:29.310
positions for at least ten times.

03:29.730 --> 03:32.040
It actually says "at least"?

03:32.040 --> 03:33.120
Yeah.

03:33.120 --> 03:34.640
Why would they say "at least"?

03:34.640 --> 03:36.350
Is it ten toggles?

03:36.350 --> 03:38.340
Is it 100 toggles? You know?

03:38.340 --> 03:39.840
Is it 1,000 toggles?

03:39.840 --> 03:41.310
10,000 toggles?

03:41.310 --> 03:43.690
- 100,000 toggles? - Sheldon!

03:45.370 --> 03:48.000
You see where I'm going with this.

03:48.620 --> 03:49.590
Just flip the switch

03:49.590 --> 03:52.950
until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow.

03:52.950 --> 03:54.780
All right, that seems simple enough.

03:54.780 --> 03:57.740
Initiating calibration sequence.

03:57.740 --> 03:59.820
One, two, three, four,

03:59.820 --> 04:03.000
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

04:06.200 --> 04:10.130
Well, I suppose ten is technically "at least ten."

04:11.800 --> 04:14.960
But they're still getting at least one angry letter.

04:16.490 --> 04:19.090
Now I rotate it horizontally

04:19.090 --> 04:23.430
on its center axis until the lights turn green.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.690
Initiating rotation sequence.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.570
Don't look at me, initiate.

04:33.720 --> 04:34.980
What does red and yellow mean?

04:34.980 --> 04:36.740
It means the calibration failed.

04:36.740 --> 04:38.050
We have to start over.

04:38.050 --> 04:39.460
Oh. Very well.

04:39.460 --> 04:42.040
Reinitiating calibration sequence.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.670
One, two, three, four,

04:43.670 --> 04:47.220
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten...

04:49.390 --> 04:51.600
...eleven.

04:54.800 --> 04:57.420
It's a good thing I didn't send that letter.

05:03.830 --> 05:05.630
Hello, Daddy. What's up?

05:05.630 --> 05:08.310
Not much, just wanted to see how my son's doing.

05:08.310 --> 05:10.190
Very well, thank you.

05:10.190 --> 05:12.600
Are you still dating that dermatologist?

05:12.600 --> 05:14.550
If you could feel how soft my skin is,

05:14.550 --> 05:16.670
you wouldn't have to ask.

05:17.850 --> 05:20.280
Oh, and there's something else I wanted to ask you.

05:20.280 --> 05:24.230
Why did you spend a month's rent on a toy helicopter?!

05:26.050 --> 05:28.850
Oh, you're where that bill goes.

05:29.370 --> 05:31.580
I'm tired of indulging your foolish lifestyle.

05:31.580 --> 05:33.260
It's time you learned responsibility.

05:33.260 --> 05:34.650
And the only way to teach you that

05:34.650 --> 05:36.230
is to cut off your allowance.

05:36.230 --> 05:38.050
No, Daddy, no!

05:38.050 --> 05:40.640
There are lots of other ways to teach me responsibility.

05:40.640 --> 05:41.890
I know, you can give me an egg

05:41.890 --> 05:44.560
and make me take care of it for a week!

05:45.150 --> 05:46.980
No, my mind is made up.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.420
Starting now, you're on your own.

05:48.420 --> 05:52.330
But, Daddy, I-I miss my family so much,

05:52.330 --> 05:54.550
and with you and Mummy getting a divorce,

05:54.550 --> 05:56.710
I feel sad and empty.

05:56.710 --> 05:58.990
Buying a little toy every now and then

05:58.990 --> 06:01.200
helps me fill that void.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.940
So while I can't hug you every day,

06:02.940 --> 06:04.260
flying that helicopter...

06:04.260 --> 06:06.570
I'm cutting you off.

06:06.950 --> 06:10.300
Just to be clear, financially or mid-sentence?

06:12.760 --> 06:13.950
No red and yellow,

06:13.950 --> 06:15.790
no red and yellow.

06:16.350 --> 06:18.600
- It's green! - Yay! We did it!

06:20.020 --> 06:21.860
God, if it's this much fun to rotate,

06:21.860 --> 06:23.870
imagine when we fly it.

06:24.720 --> 06:27.260
Okay, now all I have to do is rotate it vertically

06:27.260 --> 06:30.280
until the lights turn off.

06:30.660 --> 06:32.260
Oh, no!

06:32.930 --> 06:35.790
All right, playtime's over.

06:35.790 --> 06:37.520
Let's open this baby up.

06:38.030 --> 06:39.760
Won't that void the warranty?

06:39.760 --> 06:43.880
Sheldon, I have a master's degree in engineering.

06:43.880 --> 06:47.220
I wipe my bottom with warranties.

06:49.050 --> 06:50.210
Except for AppleCare.

06:50.210 --> 06:53.210
That pays for itself in the long run.

06:56.290 --> 06:57.590
Hey, where'd you go?

06:57.590 --> 07:00.340
I got you a little something to cheer you up.

07:00.340 --> 07:01.270
Really?

07:01.270 --> 07:03.120
Sex last night, pancakes this morning--

07:03.120 --> 07:04.670
Am I dying?

07:06.110 --> 07:07.420
Just open it.

07:09.300 --> 07:10.180
A cap and gown?

07:10.180 --> 07:11.720
Why do I need a cap and gown?

07:11.720 --> 07:14.540
Because you are giving your commencement speech.

07:14.540 --> 07:15.670
What are you talking about?

07:15.670 --> 07:16.800
I called your old high school

07:16.800 --> 07:19.860
and convinced them to let you give your speech over Skype.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.470
Really?

07:21.650 --> 07:22.440
That's amazing!

07:22.440 --> 07:24.570
And you gave me the robes to give it in.

07:24.570 --> 07:25.230
Thank you.

07:25.230 --> 07:26.490
Yeah, now about those--

07:26.490 --> 07:27.910
uh, they came from a costume shop,

07:27.910 --> 07:30.150
and all they had left was sexy graduate,

07:30.150 --> 07:31.750
so they...

07:32.360 --> 07:34.570
might be a little short.

07:35.190 --> 07:37.850
- Short and sexy, that's my wheelhouse. - Yeah!

07:47.690 --> 07:50.460
Boy, oh, boy, that's a lot of pieces.

07:51.450 --> 07:52.920
You know what they all do, right?

07:52.920 --> 07:54.970
Yes, of course.

07:55.520 --> 07:56.800
What about this one?

07:56.800 --> 07:59.320
Well, I... how familiar are you

07:59.320 --> 08:02.020
with miniaturized integrated logic circuits?

08:02.020 --> 08:02.780
Not very.

08:02.780 --> 08:05.830
That right there is a miniaturized integrated logic circuit.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.540
So, can you get it working?

08:10.540 --> 08:12.950
I'm an MIT-trained engineer.

08:12.950 --> 08:16.010
I've built components for the space station.

08:16.010 --> 08:19.290
I thought the zero-gravity toilet didn't work.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.070
It worked fine,

08:21.070 --> 08:23.890
it just wasn't designed for Russian cosmonauts

08:23.890 --> 08:27.100
and their potato-based diet.

08:27.100 --> 08:28.350
Hey, guys.

08:28.350 --> 08:29.390
Hello.

08:29.390 --> 08:31.560
I have to return the helicopter. My father...

08:31.560 --> 08:34.390
What did you do?!

08:36.100 --> 08:37.090
Well, don't worry.

08:37.090 --> 08:38.690
He went to MIT.

08:38.690 --> 08:40.440
He can solve any problem,

08:40.440 --> 08:44.520
as long as it doesn't originate in a Russian man's colon.

08:50.270 --> 08:51.580
I don't freaking believe this!

08:51.580 --> 08:53.160
Relax, it'll be fine.

08:53.160 --> 08:55.380
No, you have to put this back together right now,

08:55.380 --> 08:56.630
so I can return it!

08:56.630 --> 08:58.270
You can't return it.

08:58.270 --> 09:01.300
Howard wiped his bottom with the warranty.

09:01.880 --> 09:02.960
What?!

09:02.960 --> 09:05.670
I think metaphorically.

09:05.670 --> 09:08.740
But he was in the bathroom for a while.

09:09.420 --> 09:11.320
Howard, my father cut me off.

09:11.320 --> 09:12.730
I have to get my money back for this!

09:12.730 --> 09:13.940
Calm down.

09:13.940 --> 09:14.860
Okay.

09:15.260 --> 09:16.920
Okay, you're right.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.810
It's time for me to step up

09:18.810 --> 09:21.190
and take responsibility for my life.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.280
Be a man.

09:25.210 --> 09:27.450
Hello, Mummy.

09:28.720 --> 09:29.680
Hello, Rajesh.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.330
What a nice surprise.

09:31.330 --> 09:33.110
Well, I've been thinking about you.

09:33.110 --> 09:35.940
How are you doing? Are you happy, Mummy?

09:36.640 --> 09:38.710
Such a sweet boy for asking.

09:38.710 --> 09:42.580
Can't believe you come from the poison seed of your father.

09:42.580 --> 09:45.260
Well, I like to think I take mostly after you.

09:45.260 --> 09:46.450
Anyway, speaking of Daddy,

09:46.450 --> 09:48.870
I had a very strange conversation with him.

09:48.870 --> 09:50.980
He said he couldn't afford to send me money anymore

09:50.980 --> 09:53.930
because of his active social life.

09:53.930 --> 09:57.120
What does that mean, "active social life"?

09:57.120 --> 09:59.030
Well, let's not talk about him

09:59.030 --> 10:01.360
or whatever shenanigans he may or may not be up to.

10:01.360 --> 10:02.890
Let's talk about you.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.250
Rajesh, is your father seeing someone?

10:06.250 --> 10:09.350
All I know, Mummy, is that he's a single wealthy doctor,

10:09.350 --> 10:10.780
and now, for some reason,

10:10.780 --> 10:14.180
there's no money for your little boy.

10:15.920 --> 10:18.500
Well, however much money your father was giving you,

10:18.500 --> 10:19.530
I'll give you more.

10:19.530 --> 10:21.680
Thank you, Mummy, I love you!

10:21.680 --> 10:24.770
Helicopters for everybody!

10:26.310 --> 10:27.780
What's taking so long?

10:27.780 --> 10:29.770
I don't think this is gonna work.

10:29.770 --> 10:31.760
Just let me see.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.220
Sweetie, you know you're supposed to wear clothes

10:39.220 --> 10:41.120
underneath a graduation gown.

10:41.120 --> 10:43.920
A: surprised you know that.

10:44.250 --> 10:47.980
B: I wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.400
Well, you do.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.960
- Thank you. - Yeah.

10:52.830 --> 10:55.100
You're gonna be on Skype; they're not gonna see your legs.

10:55.100 --> 10:57.300
Well, I'm gonna go put on some pants just in case.

10:57.300 --> 11:01.220
But I have to say, this is very freeing.

11:02.160 --> 11:05.300
Add a belt and I'll take you someplace nice.

11:06.110 --> 11:08.890
Done and done.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.910
Okay, I think I've narrowed it down

11:16.910 --> 11:20.670
to a faulty pin on the onboard communication chip.

11:20.670 --> 11:22.930
Very impressive.

11:22.930 --> 11:25.180
You know, when you're done with that,

11:25.180 --> 11:28.020
can you look at this?

11:29.170 --> 11:31.770
It doesn't make smoke anymore.

11:31.770 --> 11:33.560
One toy at a time.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.760
Mm. Sorry.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.520
Ah, maybe it's for the best.

11:36.520 --> 11:38.330
I hear locomotive smoke

11:38.330 --> 11:42.030
is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados.

11:42.610 --> 11:43.800
What's the first one?

11:43.800 --> 11:45.630
Suicide.

11:46.530 --> 11:47.730
Wrong.

11:47.730 --> 11:50.060
Obesity.

11:51.640 --> 11:52.920
I have the tool you wanted.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.310
Thank you.

11:54.310 --> 11:56.150
You guys don't have to go to the trouble.

11:56.150 --> 11:57.130
I'm back in the money now;

11:57.130 --> 11:59.050
I can just buy another helicopter.

11:59.050 --> 12:00.100
It's not about the money.

12:00.100 --> 12:01.500
It's about solving a problem.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.080
It's why I became an engineer.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.630
It's what I like to do, it's what I'm trained to do.

12:05.630 --> 12:06.760
It's who I am.

12:06.760 --> 12:11.340
Oh, look at you-- the little engineer that could.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.980
Why don't you just call tech support?

12:13.980 --> 12:16.860
- Hey! - Not cool!

12:16.860 --> 12:17.620
What?

12:17.620 --> 12:19.390
There's two kinds of people in this world:

12:19.390 --> 12:20.860
those who call tech support

12:20.860 --> 12:24.190
and those who make fun of the people who call tech support.

12:24.190 --> 12:26.030
I call tech support all the time.

12:26.030 --> 12:28.520
- You call tech support! - What a baby!

12:30.330 --> 12:33.090
And now, for our commencement address,

12:33.090 --> 12:35.780
one of our most distinguished alumni,

12:35.780 --> 12:40.930
noted Caltech physicist Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.720
Members of the faculty, students,

12:46.720 --> 12:49.300
I'm excited to speak to you today.

12:49.300 --> 12:52.500
I can't help but remember the last time I was in this auditorium.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.190
Two guys from the lacrosse team

12:54.190 --> 12:57.220
played keep-away with my asthma inhaler.

12:57.220 --> 13:01.060
But enough about my ten-year reunion.

13:02.180 --> 13:03.620
I'd also like to take a moment

13:03.620 --> 13:05.700
to thank my beautiful fiancee

13:05.700 --> 13:07.160
for to helping make this speech possible,

13:07.160 --> 13:10.040
even though weather nearly prevented it.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.790
Oh. Hello.

13:11.790 --> 13:13.430
I-I didn't know he was gonna point it at me,

13:13.430 --> 13:14.630
so...

13:14.630 --> 13:16.460
don't do drugs and stay in school.

13:16.460 --> 13:17.460
They're graduating.

13:17.460 --> 13:19.550
Okay, bye!

13:21.750 --> 13:23.600
All right, the power supply is reconnected.

13:23.600 --> 13:24.730
I think we're back in business.

13:24.730 --> 13:27.640
Let's just run a few tests before we take it outside.

13:27.640 --> 13:28.730
Sheldon, we got WiFi?

13:28.730 --> 13:29.390
Check.

13:29.390 --> 13:29.990
GPS?

13:29.990 --> 13:30.650
Check.

13:30.650 --> 13:31.570
Battery charged?

13:31.570 --> 13:32.240
Check.

13:32.240 --> 13:35.950
Four hours of our lives gone? Check.

13:36.670 --> 13:38.110
All right. All systems go.

13:38.110 --> 13:39.440
In five...

13:39.440 --> 13:42.940
...four, three, two, one.

13:47.500 --> 13:50.430
That's what my train used to do.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.210
Ready to call tech support?

13:55.750 --> 13:57.650
Give me the number.

13:58.770 --> 14:02.520
Probably wind up talking to some foreign guy

14:02.520 --> 14:05.650
who's reading from the same manual I have.

14:14.060 --> 14:16.930
It's my father, you jerks.

14:19.920 --> 14:21.040
Hello, Daddy.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.480
What did you say to your mother?

14:22.480 --> 14:23.210
Nothing.

14:23.210 --> 14:24.990
I was just calling to check in,

14:24.990 --> 14:26.440
make sure she's doing okay.

14:26.440 --> 14:27.600
Well, after talking to you,

14:27.600 --> 14:30.640
she seems to think I'm some sort of playboy.

14:31.500 --> 14:32.080
Really?

14:32.080 --> 14:35.120
I don't know where she'd get an idea like that.

14:35.530 --> 14:38.110
You know mummy and her crazy imagination.

14:38.110 --> 14:41.030
I'm so lucky I take after you.

14:41.830 --> 14:44.260
You think you take after me?

14:44.750 --> 14:46.150
Well, I try to.

14:46.150 --> 14:47.860
I certainly wouldn't be a scientist

14:47.860 --> 14:51.250
if you hadn't been my role model.

14:52.520 --> 14:57.770
Who wants to go to Vegas in a real helicopter?!

14:59.450 --> 15:01.610
It was L. Frank Baum who said,

15:01.610 --> 15:06.470
"No thief, however skillful, can rob one of knowledge,

15:06.470 --> 15:11.580
and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure."

15:11.580 --> 15:15.530
Wow, I'm boring myself.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.850
Sorry, I can't see any of your faces right now,

15:19.850 --> 15:22.350
but I bet they look like this.

15:25.390 --> 15:29.630
Uh, you know, I-I wrote an entire speech

15:29.630 --> 15:32.310
to say how high school prepares you

15:32.310 --> 15:34.820
and what a wonderful place it is,

15:34.820 --> 15:37.180
but I hated it.

15:37.180 --> 15:41.140
Maybe high school's great if you look like this...

15:42.570 --> 15:47.280
...but I didn't even feel like I existed at that school.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.450
And now that I think about it,

15:49.450 --> 15:51.680
I bet a lot of you feel the same way.

15:51.680 --> 15:56.220
So, for the remainder of my speech,

15:56.220 --> 15:58.910
this is for the invisible kids.

15:58.910 --> 16:01.980
Uh, maybe you never fit in.

16:01.980 --> 16:04.410
Or maybe you're the smallest kid in the school,

16:04.410 --> 16:06.670
or the heaviest or the weirdest.

16:06.670 --> 16:07.770
Maybe you're graduating

16:07.770 --> 16:10.210
and you still haven't had your first kiss.

16:10.210 --> 16:12.660
By the way, 19;

16:12.660 --> 16:16.770
and Geraldine Coco, wherever you are, thank you.

16:17.890 --> 16:19.620
Maybe you don't have any friends.

16:19.620 --> 16:22.520
And guess what? That's okay.

16:22.850 --> 16:25.130
While all the popular kids are off doing--

16:25.130 --> 16:26.690
whatever, I don't know what they were doing

16:26.690 --> 16:28.030
'cause I was never there...

16:28.030 --> 16:29.850
I'll-I'll tell you later.

16:31.110 --> 16:33.360
My point is,

16:33.360 --> 16:35.320
while you're spending all this time on your own,

16:35.320 --> 16:39.090
building computers or practicing your cello,

16:39.090 --> 16:40.660
what you're really doing

16:40.660 --> 16:43.360
is becoming interesting.

16:43.360 --> 16:46.160
And when people finally do notice you,

16:46.160 --> 16:49.580
they're gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought.

16:49.580 --> 16:52.130
And for those of you who were popular in high school,

16:52.130 --> 16:54.760
it's over, sorry.

16:55.390 --> 16:58.450
Thank you and congratulations.

17:02.250 --> 17:04.210
Your call is important to us.

17:04.210 --> 17:07.100
All our technicians are busy helping other customers.

17:07.100 --> 17:08.630
Please stay on the line

17:08.630 --> 17:11.220
and someone will be with you shortly.

17:20.950 --> 17:22.850
What happened to me?

17:25.260 --> 17:27.710
When did I become an old man

17:27.710 --> 17:31.050
baffled by modern technology?

17:31.050 --> 17:31.920
Next thing you know,

17:31.920 --> 17:34.810
I'll be hitching my pants up to my armpits

17:34.810 --> 17:36.350
and complaining about

17:36.350 --> 17:39.570
the awful music the kids are listening to.

17:39.570 --> 17:42.490
It is awful, isn't it?

17:42.490 --> 17:45.270
Listen to that noise.

17:48.590 --> 17:49.620
Hang on, hang on.

17:49.620 --> 17:51.110
It's working! I did it!

17:51.110 --> 17:51.880
How'd you do that?

17:51.880 --> 17:54.390
No idea, but I did it!

17:56.680 --> 17:57.900
Maybe you shouldn't be flying it inside.

17:57.900 --> 17:59.110
Well, I'm not flying it!

17:59.110 --> 18:00.100
Then who is?

18:00.100 --> 18:00.950
I don't know!

18:00.950 --> 18:04.420
Must be getting a WiFi signal from somewhere else!

18:07.150 --> 18:10.560
Initiate landing sequence! Initiate landing sequence!

18:11.360 --> 18:12.780
Hey, the camera's working!

18:12.780 --> 18:14.140
Oh, look, it's me.

18:17.220 --> 18:18.540
Tech support, can I help you?

18:18.540 --> 18:22.750
Yes, it's a robot uprising! Call the police!

18:30.630 --> 18:31.830
So you really think they liked it?

18:31.830 --> 18:34.240
Oh, sweetie, it was the best speech I...

18:37.520 --> 18:39.980
Don't worry, everyone in here is safe.
