WEBVTT

00:03.790 --> 00:05.470
What color would you like to be?

00:05.470 --> 00:08.100
Well, I'd like to be green, but you know you always take it.

00:08.100 --> 00:09.510
That's not true.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.240
Any color's fine with me.

00:11.240 --> 00:15.650
Yeah, I could be a-a combination of blue and yellow.

00:16.260 --> 00:17.530
Blue and yellow make green.

00:17.530 --> 00:19.410
Well, then it's settled.

00:21.250 --> 00:22.500
Hi. Ready to go?

00:22.500 --> 00:24.350
Oh, good news, we ordered lunch,

00:24.350 --> 00:28.160
so we can all stay here and play Lord of the Rings Risk.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.990
Sheldon, we said that we would play games with you tonight.

00:30.990 --> 00:32.460
Oh, no, we'll still be playing it tonight...

00:32.460 --> 00:35.000
this game can easily take eight hours.

00:35.440 --> 00:36.910
Sweetie, you really thought I'd want to do this?

00:36.910 --> 00:38.290
- No. - Well, did you tell him that?

00:38.290 --> 00:41.750
- Yes. - Did you say it out loud with words?

00:41.750 --> 00:43.710
No.

00:44.180 --> 00:46.370
I don't want to spend the whole day playing a board game.

00:46.370 --> 00:48.210
Yeah, well, you may change your mind when you hear

00:48.210 --> 00:50.630
that this is the new expanded edition

00:50.630 --> 00:52.970
which contains a more complete map of Middle Earth,

00:52.970 --> 00:55.860
now including the Haradwaith Territories.

00:57.570 --> 01:00.260
I will literally race you to the car.

01:00.410 --> 01:02.520
No, no, no, come on, don't leave. Just try it.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.250
No. We're always doing what you guys want.

01:04.250 --> 01:07.060
Just once, it'd be nice if you did something we wanted.

01:07.060 --> 01:09.240
You want to be green?

01:11.440 --> 01:12.630
You know, they really have tried to

01:12.630 --> 01:14.460
like a lot of the same stuff we're into.

01:14.460 --> 01:16.810
Yeah, we do game nights and video game nights

01:16.810 --> 01:18.920
and we watch movies with director's commentary.

01:18.920 --> 01:19.760
Oh, my favorite...

01:19.760 --> 01:21.910
George Lucas can talk all the way through Star Wars,

01:21.910 --> 01:25.000
I say one word and I'm banished to the kitchen.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.480
Yeah, today Amy and I are deciding what we're all gonna do.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.430
You got it, you girls are in charge.

01:30.430 --> 01:32.560
- Thank you. - Sheldon?

01:33.040 --> 01:34.580
Fine.

01:34.580 --> 01:37.320
Now that we're not playing, you can be green.

01:37.320 --> 01:38.740
- Thank you. - And since you're green this time,

01:38.740 --> 01:40.870
I can be it next time.

01:41.180 --> 01:42.620
All right, let's see. What's something fun

01:42.620 --> 01:44.520
the guys would never take us to do?

01:44.520 --> 01:46.340
Oh, I know... we could go horseback riding.

01:46.340 --> 01:47.630
I actually can't.

01:47.630 --> 01:51.450
My hips don't open wider than 22 degrees.

01:52.910 --> 01:55.900
I rode a very thin pony once.

01:55.900 --> 01:59.350
On the first bump... just popped right off.

02:00.890 --> 02:02.950
All right, well, what do you want to do?

02:02.950 --> 02:05.560
There's a craft and folk art museum on Wilshire.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.820
Well, that's Wilshire's problem.

02:09.280 --> 02:11.150
Come on, you know, there-there's got to be something fun

02:11.150 --> 02:12.800
we could do that the guys will hate.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.650
Hang on, why do we have to hate it?

02:14.650 --> 02:18.070
Three words: Doctor Who convention.

02:18.070 --> 02:19.840
I-I did not force you to go to that.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.990
You walked out of the house in a fez and bow tie.

02:21.990 --> 02:23.720
I went so you didn't get beat up.

02:24.280 --> 02:25.600
I wasn't gonna get beat up.

02:25.600 --> 02:28.590
You were, but somehow I held myself back.

02:29.120 --> 02:31.540
You know what you could make us do? Ice-skating.

02:31.540 --> 02:33.760
The cold air will trigger Leonard's asthma

02:33.760 --> 02:35.720
and it plays right into my well-known fear of

02:35.720 --> 02:38.790
getting flattened by a Zamboni.

02:39.310 --> 02:42.140
Now you're helping them find ways to make us miserable?

02:42.140 --> 02:43.030
Well, I'm sorry, Leonard,

02:43.030 --> 02:44.970
I'm a problem-solver, it's what I do.

02:46.180 --> 02:48.070
I actually can't go ice-skating.

02:48.070 --> 02:51.550
I have unnaturally brittle ankles.

02:51.550 --> 02:54.590
Is there any part of your body that's normal?

03:22.750 --> 03:24.990
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

03:24.990 --> 03:27.570
- Will you please relax? - I can't take it, dude.

03:27.570 --> 03:29.190
- You okay? - No, I'm not okay.

03:29.190 --> 03:31.620
I feel like I'm gonna jump out of my skin.

03:31.620 --> 03:34.610
I told you not to wax down there.

03:35.640 --> 03:38.340
It's itchy when it grows back.

03:39.420 --> 03:43.000
I'm worried about the New Horizons space probe.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.180
What's he talking about?

03:44.180 --> 03:46.610
Nine years ago he was part of a team

03:46.610 --> 03:49.420
that launched a spacecraft to collect data about Pluto.

03:49.420 --> 03:50.910
It's finally close enough,

03:50.910 --> 03:52.980
so this morning it turned itself on.

03:52.980 --> 03:53.880
We hope.

03:53.880 --> 03:56.310
The signal has to travel over three billion miles.

03:56.310 --> 03:59.220
So it's gonna be hours before we know if it even survived.

03:59.220 --> 04:00.590
Now we get to see him flip out because he's worried

04:00.590 --> 04:02.210
it was demolished by space ice.

04:02.210 --> 04:04.460
Space ice is no joke.

04:05.190 --> 04:08.030
I can't even watch Frozen anymore.

04:10.720 --> 04:13.560
Ooh, the philharmonic is playing Beethoven downtown.

04:13.560 --> 04:15.550
Yeah, well, before you say yes,

04:15.550 --> 04:19.400
it's not the movie about the big dog.

04:21.420 --> 04:24.330
How come we can't think of something we both want to do?

04:24.330 --> 04:26.280
Because you always pick what we do

04:26.280 --> 04:28.040
and I just go along with it.

04:28.040 --> 04:29.420
Ah, interesting--

04:29.420 --> 04:31.650
we're being accused of making you do things you don't like,

04:31.650 --> 04:34.310
and here you are, doing the same thing to poor Amy.

04:34.310 --> 04:37.410
You should point out the hypocrisy of that.

04:40.620 --> 04:42.290
That's what I was doing.

04:43.100 --> 04:45.080
Oh, that wasn't clear.

04:45.560 --> 04:47.530
Try it again, but this time drive it home

04:47.530 --> 04:50.550
with, "How do you like them apples, missy?"

04:51.430 --> 04:53.120
All right, keep thinking.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.090
You're making it too complicated.

04:55.090 --> 04:56.590
Why not stick to the basics?

04:56.590 --> 04:57.990
Go shopping for clothes

04:57.990 --> 05:00.020
while Leonard and I sit in those uncomfortable chairs

05:00.020 --> 05:01.590
and hold your purses, hmm?

05:01.590 --> 05:03.220
I know I'd hate that.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.430
Leonard?

05:04.430 --> 05:07.000
Well, yeah.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.570
Well, then, it's settled?

05:09.570 --> 05:11.720
What do you say? Sounds kind of perfect.

05:11.720 --> 05:15.790
It does-- somehow he managed to take all the fun out of it.

05:15.790 --> 05:19.160
Well, once again, it's what I do.

05:21.230 --> 05:23.490
Oh, another two hours to go.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.150
The wait is killing me.

05:25.150 --> 05:26.320
I know. I get it.

05:26.320 --> 05:29.310
When I was in the Soyuz capsule returning from the space station,

05:29.310 --> 05:31.430
plummeting toward Earth at 17,000 miles per hour...

05:31.430 --> 05:32.330
Before you finish,

05:32.330 --> 05:35.280
is this a story about patience and waiting

05:35.280 --> 05:39.090
or just another reminder that you went to space?

05:40.370 --> 05:42.630
A story can do two things.

05:42.940 --> 05:45.340
Ugh, I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack.

05:45.340 --> 05:46.650
You work in pharmaceuticals...

05:46.650 --> 05:49.290
don't you have anything you can give him?

05:49.640 --> 05:52.860
All I have is our new urine flow drug.

05:53.530 --> 05:54.910
Won't help with his anxiety,

05:54.910 --> 05:56.410
but it's so strong, when he pees

05:56.410 --> 05:59.830
he'll fly around the room like he's got a jet pack.

06:00.850 --> 06:03.490
I can't stop thinking about it.

06:03.490 --> 06:06.020
You know, worrying won't have any effect on what happens.

06:06.020 --> 06:07.070
I know.

06:07.070 --> 06:09.700
Maybe you need to do something more productive.

06:10.730 --> 06:12.370
Okay.

06:13.580 --> 06:16.570
If I make this shot

06:16.570 --> 06:18.260
in the trash can,

06:18.540 --> 06:20.180
the probe will have arrived

06:20.180 --> 06:23.160
in perfect working order.

06:23.160 --> 06:25.220
So, in addition to being crazy, you're resting the fate

06:25.220 --> 06:28.590
of the mission on your athletic prowess.

06:29.040 --> 06:29.780
Yes.

06:29.780 --> 06:32.950
The man who crashed his stationary bike.

06:33.780 --> 06:36.010
I didn't crash it, okay?

06:36.010 --> 06:37.680
My playlist was too up-tempo,

06:37.680 --> 06:40.790
I got light-headed and I fell off.

06:41.580 --> 06:43.310
Okay.

06:43.950 --> 06:45.530
It all...

06:45.530 --> 06:47.160
comes down...

06:48.400 --> 06:50.520
to this.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.790
You happy? Now you can relax.

06:54.790 --> 06:56.060
What kind of scientist are you?

06:56.060 --> 06:58.740
Everyone knows you got to make two out of three.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.050
This isn't so bad.

07:08.890 --> 07:10.450
That's easy for you to say.

07:10.450 --> 07:13.900
Your chair's not facing the lingerie section.

07:14.990 --> 07:17.890
Boy, that's a lot of panties.

07:18.220 --> 07:20.940
You guys comfy? This might take a while.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.510
You know, I don't understand why women insist

07:22.510 --> 07:25.220
on making a big production out of buying clothes.

07:25.220 --> 07:26.840
No, you're right, we should do what you do.

07:26.840 --> 07:31.060
Have our mom send us pants from the Walmart in Houston.

07:31.720 --> 07:32.980
They have a man there

07:32.980 --> 07:36.100
who understands my personal style.

07:36.100 --> 07:37.730
Bye.

07:37.730 --> 07:40.000
Uh, I've got some bad news.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.780
There's no cell service in here.

07:43.570 --> 07:45.830
Well, that's all right.

07:45.830 --> 07:47.130
There were plenty of ways to pass the time

07:47.130 --> 07:49.360
before smart phones were invented.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.600
That's true.

07:51.020 --> 07:52.750
I'll look them up.

07:55.510 --> 07:58.280
Son of a biscuit.

07:58.740 --> 07:59.810
Sheldon, it's fine.

07:59.810 --> 08:01.140
No, it's not fine.

08:01.140 --> 08:04.490
What kind of store in the 21st century doesn't at least have Wi-Fi?

08:04.490 --> 08:05.900
I'm going to call their corporate office...

08:05.900 --> 08:08.130
Son of a biscuit!

08:12.700 --> 08:16.950
Let's see, my armies are going to attack

08:16.950 --> 08:19.390
the Shire from Buckland.

08:19.390 --> 08:22.510
And I roll...

08:26.270 --> 08:28.480
a five and a three.

08:28.480 --> 08:29.590
Okay.

08:29.590 --> 08:33.350
And to defend, I roll...

08:34.230 --> 08:36.410
two sixes. I win.

08:37.130 --> 08:40.240
Boy, double-sixes again.

08:40.240 --> 08:41.480
You know... if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

08:41.480 --> 08:44.130
I wouldn't believe it.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.910
I wonder how long we're gonna be stuck here.

08:46.910 --> 08:48.770
I don't know, but the girls do a lot for us.

08:48.770 --> 08:50.140
It's the least we can do.

08:50.140 --> 08:51.280
Oh, that's true.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.600
I suppose it's only fair we make compromises.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.900
Look at you, being all mature.

08:57.400 --> 09:00.160
I don't know why you're so surprised.

09:00.160 --> 09:01.850
If there's one thing I know about after living with you

09:01.850 --> 09:05.370
for so many years, it's how to compromise.

09:05.880 --> 09:07.650
I-I'm sorry?

09:07.650 --> 09:10.200
You make compromises for me?

09:11.320 --> 09:13.590
All the time.

09:14.440 --> 09:16.800
On Earth?

09:18.670 --> 09:21.280
In our lives?

09:21.840 --> 09:24.610
That-That we're living?

09:24.610 --> 09:26.530
Oh, yes. I...

09:26.530 --> 09:30.020
Just yesterday, you had a-a big piece of lettuce

09:30.020 --> 09:31.530
stuck in your teeth at lunch.

09:31.530 --> 09:33.440
Did I say anything?

09:33.440 --> 09:35.270
No.

09:36.300 --> 09:38.120
I compromised

09:38.120 --> 09:40.550
and kept my mouth shut.

09:40.550 --> 09:44.130
Like you should've, because everyone was laughing at you.

09:45.240 --> 09:46.700
That is not a compromise.

09:46.700 --> 09:48.880
A compromise is me driving you everywhere

09:48.880 --> 09:50.830
because you refuse to learn how.

09:50.830 --> 09:53.050
Oh, I learned how. Amy taught me.

09:53.050 --> 09:54.940
What? Then-Then why don't you do it?

09:54.940 --> 09:57.980
Uh, well, it's scary.

09:58.960 --> 10:02.570
And sometimes I get the pedals mixed up.

10:03.330 --> 10:06.330
But, more importantly, driving me to work

10:06.330 --> 10:09.770
is one of the things that gives your life purpose.

10:10.810 --> 10:12.780
I can't take that away from you,

10:12.780 --> 10:15.940
so... what do I do?

10:17.140 --> 10:19.910
Oh, come on, I'm practically feeding you the answer.

10:19.910 --> 10:22.660
I compromise.

10:24.780 --> 10:27.990
- Hey, uh, thanks for keeping me company. - I'm happy to.

10:27.990 --> 10:30.700
I think getting out of the apartment will do you good.

10:30.700 --> 10:33.520
So... where we headed?

10:33.520 --> 10:36.360
If it's okay with you, I'd like to go to temple.

10:36.980 --> 10:40.320
Buddy, trust me, you don't want to convert to Judaism.

10:41.190 --> 10:42.930
I mean, I know I make it look cool,

10:42.930 --> 10:47.630
but... it's not all briskets and dreidels.

10:48.040 --> 10:50.500
I meant a Hindu temple.

10:50.500 --> 10:53.440
Oh. Okay.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.730
It's not like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, right?

10:55.730 --> 10:59.160
Some bald guy with horns isn't gonna rip my heart out.

10:59.160 --> 11:02.160
Dude, that movie's an imperialist fantasy

11:02.160 --> 11:05.450
that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion

11:05.450 --> 11:07.840
look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians.

11:07.840 --> 11:08.820
You love that movie.

11:08.820 --> 11:11.530
Yeah, it's pretty great.

11:14.600 --> 11:17.500
I'm surprised to see you suddenly get religious.

11:17.500 --> 11:18.470
Why?

11:18.470 --> 11:20.990
Well, because I've known you for ten years

11:20.990 --> 11:22.750
and you've never gone to temple,

11:22.750 --> 11:25.220
you never talked about believing in God,

11:25.220 --> 11:28.850
and last Diwali I watched you eat two pounds of sacred cow

11:28.850 --> 11:31.890
at a Brazilian steak house.

11:31.890 --> 11:35.070
Religion is a very personal thing.

11:35.070 --> 11:37.310
I do go to temple-- I just... I don't talk about it.

11:37.310 --> 11:39.380
Yeah, but you're a scientist.

11:39.380 --> 11:39.930
So?

11:39.930 --> 11:42.090
So, as a scientist, you believe the way to understand the universe

11:42.090 --> 11:43.660
is through facts and evidence,

11:43.660 --> 11:45.270
and now you're counting on some

11:45.270 --> 11:48.590
blue chick with a hundred arms to help you?

11:48.590 --> 11:50.170
That is so offensive.

11:50.170 --> 11:52.360
Does everything you know about Hinduism come from Indiana Jones?

11:52.360 --> 11:56.730
No. There's also Apu from The Simpsons.

11:56.730 --> 12:00.580
Well, lots of scientists believe in God.

12:00.580 --> 12:03.040
Okay? Newton, uh, Faraday,

12:03.040 --> 12:05.010
uh, Pascal-- all were believers.

12:05.010 --> 12:06.680
Even Einstein was famous for

12:06.680 --> 12:08.500
attacking quantum theory on the grounds that

12:08.500 --> 12:11.050
"God does not play dice with the universe."

12:11.050 --> 12:12.630
Well, of course he believed in God...

12:12.630 --> 12:15.370
he slept with Marilyn Monroe.

12:15.370 --> 12:16.900
Actually there's no proof of that.

12:16.900 --> 12:20.230
You believe in your religion, I'll believe in mine.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.470
How's it going in there?

12:25.850 --> 12:28.490
Not really a great outfit for work,

12:28.490 --> 12:32.240
unless something opens up in the hookers and whores division.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.630
- Hey, can I ask you something? - Sure.

12:35.630 --> 12:38.160
Do I really force you to do things you don't want to?

12:38.160 --> 12:40.050
Yeah, but it's okay.

12:40.050 --> 12:41.610
How is it okay?

12:41.610 --> 12:43.660
I promised myself, if I ever got friends,

12:43.660 --> 12:45.880
I'd do whatever they said.

12:46.670 --> 12:50.260
Really, I'm lucky you found me before a cult did.

12:51.120 --> 12:53.030
Well, you know, that was a long time ago.

12:53.030 --> 12:54.740
You're a different woman now.

12:54.740 --> 12:57.440
You're smart, you've got great friends,

12:57.440 --> 12:59.140
you've got a boyfriend, you're pretty,

12:59.140 --> 13:02.060
you have zero fashion sense, but...

13:02.060 --> 13:05.110
Anyway, tonight we're gonna do whatever you want.

13:05.110 --> 13:06.700
- Really? - Absolutely.

13:06.700 --> 13:09.050
You name it, we're doing it.

13:09.580 --> 13:12.590
Basket weaving at the craft museum.

13:13.780 --> 13:16.490
Well, you named it.

13:19.850 --> 13:21.760
Oh, here's another one.

13:21.760 --> 13:25.880
I wish that the apple pancake mix was on the top shelf

13:25.880 --> 13:27.650
because it starts with an "A,"

13:27.650 --> 13:29.250
but I don't put it there

13:29.250 --> 13:31.430
because I don't want you breaking one of your little legs

13:31.430 --> 13:33.840
when you're supposed to be making my breakfast.

13:36.180 --> 13:39.900
Is it my turn to talk about the compromises I make?

13:40.250 --> 13:43.090
I wasn't done, but go ahead.

13:44.020 --> 13:46.630
He said, compromising.

13:47.640 --> 13:49.250
Because of you, I'm not allowed

13:49.250 --> 13:51.520
to adjust the temperature in my own home.

13:51.520 --> 13:52.750
I'm not allowed to whistle.

13:52.750 --> 13:55.010
I don't wear shoes that might squeak.

13:55.010 --> 13:58.830
Well, you're a physicist, not a circus clown.

13:59.250 --> 14:02.580
Sheldon, do you realize I don't live with the woman I love

14:02.580 --> 14:04.410
because of you?

14:04.410 --> 14:06.650
No other reason. Just you.

14:06.650 --> 14:08.030
- Is that true? - Yes, it's true.

14:08.030 --> 14:10.060
The last time I brought it up, you had an emotional breakdown

14:10.060 --> 14:12.840
and got on a train and ran away.

14:12.840 --> 14:14.740
Well, given my history on the subject,

14:14.740 --> 14:17.740
it seems a little reckless to bring it up now.

14:19.210 --> 14:22.000
You have no idea how much you inconvenience

14:22.000 --> 14:23.720
the lives of everyone around you.

14:23.720 --> 14:25.370
It's exhausting!

14:25.370 --> 14:26.900
You know what?

14:27.380 --> 14:29.030
You think you're so tolerant,

14:29.030 --> 14:30.990
but the truth is...

14:31.330 --> 14:33.140
you're mean to me a lot.

14:33.140 --> 14:36.280
Yeah, you think that I don't notice all those sarcastic comments

14:36.280 --> 14:38.500
and those eye rolls, but I do. Hmm?

14:38.500 --> 14:41.850
I have excellent peripheral vision.

14:42.400 --> 14:45.840
On a good day, I can see my ears.

14:47.790 --> 14:50.160
Sheldon, I-I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.

14:50.160 --> 14:52.480
I've been holding a lot of this in for a while.

14:52.480 --> 14:53.680
Well, I'm sorry, too.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.560
And if you want to live with Penny,

14:55.560 --> 14:57.590
then I think you should.

14:57.590 --> 14:59.110
- Do you mean that? - Yes.

14:59.110 --> 15:01.330
Yeah, just put on your squeaky shoes and...

15:01.330 --> 15:04.350
your way out of my life.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.090
Come on, don't get upset.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.910
I'm not upset.

15:10.910 --> 15:15.470
I'm just imagining a world without my best friend in it.

15:16.750 --> 15:17.810
Sheldon.

15:17.810 --> 15:19.290
It's okay.

15:19.610 --> 15:21.990
I-I'm not leaving your world.

15:21.990 --> 15:24.370
I'm just talking about living across the hall.

15:24.370 --> 15:25.880
I understand.

15:25.880 --> 15:28.570
Either way, I want you to know that...

15:28.570 --> 15:30.840
I'm aware of how difficult I can be.

15:30.840 --> 15:32.950
So I just want to say...

15:33.900 --> 15:36.820
thank you for putting up with me.

15:37.340 --> 15:39.090
Buddy...

15:42.810 --> 15:44.040
How are you guys getting alo...?

15:44.040 --> 15:47.180
What? Why are there tears?

15:47.180 --> 15:48.080
Everything's fine.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.650
We just started talking about living arrangements.

15:50.650 --> 15:54.380
Are you crazy? You know he's a flight risk.

15:55.390 --> 15:58.210
That's exactly what I told him.

15:58.210 --> 16:00.610
Sheldon, we know this is a sensitive subject,

16:00.610 --> 16:03.260
and Leonard's not gonna move out until you're ready.

16:04.970 --> 16:08.300
Well, what if you did it gradually?

16:09.240 --> 16:10.970
All right. Well...

16:10.970 --> 16:14.190
how about we start with two nights a week

16:14.190 --> 16:15.940
I live with Penny?

16:15.940 --> 16:19.920
How about one night and...

16:19.920 --> 16:22.160
I let you whistle?

16:26.190 --> 16:26.980
Okay.

16:26.980 --> 16:29.530
When I'm not home.

16:30.920 --> 16:33.020
You got it.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.360
There we go,

16:35.360 --> 16:38.210
compromising again.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.660
We really are the best.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.070
Here we go,

16:50.070 --> 16:51.830
my first Hindu temple.

16:51.830 --> 16:53.690
You see behind the fountain,

16:53.690 --> 16:55.830
that tower that looks like a pyramid?

16:55.830 --> 16:57.190
It's called a Sikhara.

16:57.190 --> 17:01.400
It symbolizes the-the connection between the human and the divine.

17:02.170 --> 17:04.840
I always thought it was mini golf.

17:05.500 --> 17:07.600
- All right. Shall we? - Yeah.

17:07.600 --> 17:11.070
Just, uh, is there anything I should know

17:11.070 --> 17:13.070
- before I go in? - Like what?

17:13.070 --> 17:16.340
Like am I dressed okay?

17:16.340 --> 17:18.140
Really? So every other place you've been,

17:18.140 --> 17:20.850
you thought this was fine?

17:22.100 --> 17:23.470
I know you're under a lot of pressure,

17:23.470 --> 17:25.740
so I'm gonna let that pass.

17:25.740 --> 17:26.780
Sorry. You're right.

17:26.780 --> 17:28.410
I'm so stressed.

17:28.820 --> 17:32.070
But you know what, whenever I walk into that temple

17:32.070 --> 17:35.440
I realize that whatever happens, it's okay.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.020
We're all part of an immense pattern,

17:37.020 --> 17:39.580
and though we can't understand it, we can be happy to know

17:39.580 --> 17:42.640
that it's-it's working its will through us.

17:43.350 --> 17:44.930
That's nice.

17:44.930 --> 17:47.790
Whether you call it God or the universe or the self,

17:47.790 --> 17:50.540
we're all interconnected, and that's just a beautiful...

17:51.010 --> 17:54.780
Son of a bitch! That guy just dinged my car!

17:56.890 --> 17:57.940
S-Seriously?

17:57.940 --> 17:59.830
Y-You were just gonna drive away?

17:59.830 --> 18:02.460
Like my life isn't hard enough right now.

18:02.460 --> 18:05.130
A space probe might be destroyed,

18:05.130 --> 18:07.210
my parents are going through an awful divorce,

18:07.210 --> 18:11.530
the guy who cuts my dog's hair just gave her bangs!

18:11.530 --> 18:13.310
- Raj. - You saw her.

18:13.310 --> 18:16.780
She looks like Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber!

18:17.360 --> 18:18.990
Raj, you just got a text.

18:18.990 --> 18:21.800
The probe turned on. It's fine.

18:23.160 --> 18:25.100
Oh, good.

18:26.170 --> 18:28.480
Namaste, Grandpa.

18:36.790 --> 18:38.300
I thought this was gonna be boring,

18:38.300 --> 18:40.160
but it's actually kind of fun.

18:40.160 --> 18:43.280
Don't tell Amy that. We'll be here every Sunday.

18:44.070 --> 18:46.960
Sheldon, that really is an excellent basket.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.260
It's not a basket.

18:48.260 --> 18:52.520
It's a soldier's helmet from 16th century China.

18:55.470 --> 18:57.120
Very nice.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.020
Yeah, it looks great.

19:02.590 --> 19:04.450
I saw that.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.900
Well, roomie, it's only one night a week,

19:13.900 --> 19:14.930
but it's a start.

19:14.930 --> 19:16.930
I know. I'm really proud of Sheldon.

19:16.930 --> 19:18.610
Yeah, I'm proud of him, too.

19:18.610 --> 19:20.320
Can you keep it down?

19:20.320 --> 19:23.450
Some of us are trying to sleep out here.
