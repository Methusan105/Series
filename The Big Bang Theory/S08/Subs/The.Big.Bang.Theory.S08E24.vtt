00:07.590 --> 00:10.970
Can you believe it's been five years since our first date?

00:10.970 --> 00:12.560
I know.

00:13.330 --> 00:17.870
Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show?

00:21.850 --> 00:24.140
That's what you're thinking about?

00:24.140 --> 00:26.320
Well, one of the things.

00:26.780 --> 00:29.140
Are any of them me?

00:29.590 --> 00:30.860
Yes.

00:30.860 --> 00:34.140
I thought, "I can't decide if I should watch The Flash TV show.

00:34.140 --> 00:36.800
I know, I'll ask Amy."

00:38.310 --> 00:39.600
Anyway...

00:41.530 --> 00:42.990
What are you doing?

00:42.990 --> 00:46.000
You're right, you did kind of kill the mood.

00:46.430 --> 00:48.010
I didn't kill anything.

00:48.010 --> 00:51.180
You did, talking about your stupid TV show.

00:51.180 --> 00:52.600
Excuse me.

00:52.600 --> 00:55.520
Starting to watch a television show that might run for years

00:55.520 --> 00:57.580
isn't a decision to take lightly.

00:57.580 --> 01:00.710
I'm wrestling with a big commitment issue here.

01:01.120 --> 01:02.270
Really?

01:02.270 --> 01:05.070
That's the commitment issue you're wrestling with?

01:06.090 --> 01:07.110
Sheldon,

01:07.110 --> 01:08.590
do you understand the irony

01:08.590 --> 01:11.220
of your fixation on a man with super speed,

01:11.220 --> 01:13.720
while after five years all I can get out of you

01:13.720 --> 01:16.860
is a distracted make-out session on a couch?

01:17.960 --> 01:20.920
Irony's not really my strong suit.

01:21.340 --> 01:23.250
But I have been getting better with sarcasm,

01:23.250 --> 01:25.230
if you want to give that a try.

01:25.710 --> 01:28.320
Oh, sure, I'd love to.

01:29.710 --> 01:31.750
Whenever you're ready.

02:00.480 --> 02:01.380
I don't want to rush you,

02:01.380 --> 02:03.340
but I'm closing a little early tonight.

02:03.340 --> 02:05.230
Ooh. Hot date?

02:05.230 --> 02:07.500
Uh, no. I overheard Bernadette tell Howard

02:07.500 --> 02:08.630
she was making him a meat loaf,

02:08.630 --> 02:11.300
and you don't have to not ask me twice.

02:13.720 --> 02:15.690
If I stick a lightbulb on this,

02:15.690 --> 02:18.430
wouldn't it make a great lamp for my bedroom?

02:19.810 --> 02:21.640
You're kidding, right?

02:21.640 --> 02:24.060
Oh. Is this freaking you out?

02:24.060 --> 02:26.950
I guess I'm just more of a Pottery Barn,

02:26.950 --> 02:29.560
Crate and Barrel kind of guy.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.880
Maybe Pier 1 if I really want to cut loose.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.010
All right. Never mind.

02:35.010 --> 02:37.060
No, no, no. Hey, you should totally get it.

02:37.060 --> 02:38.560
In fact, I'll buy it for you.

02:38.560 --> 02:40.010
Sold!

02:42.760 --> 02:43.980
Raj, you don't have to do that.

02:43.980 --> 02:46.250
Too late! No returns!

02:49.210 --> 02:51.340
That was really intense.

02:51.340 --> 02:54.110
Well, now we know, next time we go to the farmers' market,

02:54.110 --> 02:58.060
the order is petting zoo first, then buy vegetables.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.950
Oh, good. You're here. I need your assistance.

03:04.950 --> 03:08.210
Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite?

03:09.500 --> 03:10.650
What happened?

03:10.650 --> 03:14.230
Your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals.

03:14.910 --> 03:16.520
Been there.

03:17.300 --> 03:18.640
So what do you need help with?

03:18.640 --> 03:21.620
Amy's mad at me, and I'm not clear why.

03:21.620 --> 03:23.860
Okay. Were you talking before she got upset?

03:23.860 --> 03:26.460
- Yes. - That's probably it.

03:27.410 --> 03:28.820
What'd you say to her?

03:28.820 --> 03:30.680
Well, I just asked her if I should start watching

03:30.680 --> 03:32.500
the new Flash TV series.

03:32.500 --> 03:33.900
And that made her angry?

03:33.900 --> 03:35.320
Baffling, right?

03:35.320 --> 03:37.370
We were necking like a couple of hooligans

03:37.370 --> 03:39.690
under the school bleachers.

03:40.170 --> 03:42.170
I stopped so I could ask the question.

03:42.170 --> 03:46.170
Next thing I know, good-bye, kissy face. Hello, yelly face.

03:47.210 --> 03:48.630
Well, Sheldon, when you're kissing a girl,

03:48.630 --> 03:50.780
she expects the attention to be on her.

03:50.780 --> 03:52.340
It was. I asked her

03:52.340 --> 03:55.220
if she thought I should watch The Flash.

03:55.590 --> 03:57.860
Yeah. I'm tapping out. Leonard?

03:58.210 --> 04:00.860
I'm gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment

04:00.860 --> 04:03.080
of watching an entire season of a new show.

04:03.080 --> 04:04.680
Oh, no, not just a season.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.740
If I'm in, I'm in for the whole run,

04:06.740 --> 04:09.400
even if the quality declines.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.930
I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you.

04:13.670 --> 04:14.700
Exactly.

04:14.700 --> 04:16.130
You know, I waited ten years

04:16.130 --> 04:19.340
to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly.

04:19.810 --> 04:21.210
Wait, what is wrong with you two?

04:21.210 --> 04:23.420
He was talking about television during their date night.

04:23.420 --> 04:26.510
Oh, not just date night-- our fifth anniversary.

04:26.510 --> 04:28.590
Okay, see, that's even dumber than you wondering

04:28.590 --> 04:32.360
if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat.

04:34.310 --> 04:36.480
If that happens, don't make me wait ten years

04:36.480 --> 04:39.140
to watch you eat a tin can.

04:41.190 --> 04:44.100
You guys ever notice that Emily has a bit of a twisted side?

04:44.100 --> 04:45.860
You mean 'cause she has weird tattoos?

04:45.860 --> 04:48.890
No, because she wants to have sex with me in a graveyard.

04:51.740 --> 04:53.490
One more time?

04:54.060 --> 04:55.910
She and I were supposed to watch

04:55.910 --> 04:58.100
the new Avengers movie tonight, but it was sold out.

04:58.100 --> 04:59.620
So I said, "What else do you want to do?"

04:59.620 --> 05:01.190
She said, "Let's go to a cemetery

05:01.190 --> 05:03.960
and do it on somebody's grave."

05:04.540 --> 05:07.960
Like, a random person or somebody she knew?

05:09.060 --> 05:11.470
What difference does it make?

05:11.930 --> 05:15.050
Well, if it's her father's grave and they didn't get along,

05:15.050 --> 05:17.390
then you know she holds a grudge.

05:18.670 --> 05:21.210
The only issue is that everybody has their own thing.

05:21.210 --> 05:23.020
And as long as it's two consenting adults,

05:23.020 --> 05:24.740
I guess I don't see the harm in it.

05:24.740 --> 05:26.050
Well, what if it's one consenting adult

05:26.050 --> 05:27.710
and one adult who pretends to consent

05:27.710 --> 05:30.420
because he's afraid of being alone?

05:31.770 --> 05:32.980
Well, then I guess bring a blanket.

05:32.980 --> 05:35.260
The grass gets damp at night.

05:37.360 --> 05:38.450
I don't know, guys.

05:38.450 --> 05:40.770
Maybe this relationship isn't for me.

05:40.770 --> 05:42.450
Maybe I should break up with her.

05:42.790 --> 05:44.840
Right. You're gonna break up with a girl who has sex with you.

05:44.840 --> 05:46.590
Can you believe this guy?

05:48.320 --> 05:51.260
I think if Raj wants to break up with a girl, he can do it.

05:51.260 --> 05:53.380
How are you saying that with a straight face?

05:53.380 --> 05:55.340
I don't know.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.090
You guys are being jerks.

05:58.090 --> 06:00.300
Buddy, other than Jenny Craig,

06:00.300 --> 06:02.830
you've never broken up with a girl in your life.

06:03.250 --> 06:04.830
You're one to talk.

06:04.830 --> 06:06.310
You've been complaining about Stuart

06:06.310 --> 06:07.390
living here for the past year.

06:07.390 --> 06:08.760
I don't see you showing him the door.

06:08.760 --> 06:09.570
That's not the same thing.

06:09.570 --> 06:10.940
Emily's a person.

06:10.940 --> 06:12.970
Stuart's more like an infestation,

06:12.970 --> 06:15.060
something you spray for.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.650
Baloney, okay? You two are as afraid of

06:17.650 --> 06:20.120
hurting someone's feelings as I am.

06:20.120 --> 06:23.000
That's not true. We were just laughing right in your face.

06:25.530 --> 06:26.510
Thanks for cooking.

06:26.510 --> 06:27.420
My pleasure.

06:27.420 --> 06:29.900
- That carrot was delicious. - Yeah.

06:31.180 --> 06:34.240
I wish I'd fought harder for the rest of 'em.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.430
Still haven't heard from her?

06:39.430 --> 06:41.910
No, and I'm confused.

06:41.910 --> 06:44.000
It's been nearly 24 hours.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.340
Amy should have figured out she's wrong by now.

06:48.940 --> 06:50.120
Hey, I don't think she's wrong

06:50.120 --> 06:52.800
about you going too slow in the relationship.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.170
Too slow?

06:54.170 --> 06:55.480
Yeah, you've been going out for years.

06:55.480 --> 06:56.970
You haven't even slept together.

06:56.970 --> 07:00.200
That's right. It's called foreplay.

07:02.010 --> 07:03.400
And I could make the case

07:03.400 --> 07:06.190
that you two aren't moving forward in your relationship.

07:06.190 --> 07:08.910
Uh, hello.

07:09.780 --> 07:11.510
Hello.

07:16.150 --> 07:18.720
No. Sheldon, we're getting married.

07:18.720 --> 07:20.580
But you've been engaged for over a year now,

07:20.580 --> 07:22.250
and you don't even have a wedding date.

07:22.250 --> 07:24.910
Well, we will. We're just not in a rush.

07:24.910 --> 07:26.590
Okay.

07:28.390 --> 07:30.660
We're gonna set a date.

07:30.660 --> 07:32.450
Okay. If you say so.

07:32.450 --> 07:34.040
Yeah, it's just, things are good right now.

07:34.040 --> 07:34.680
Really good.

07:34.680 --> 07:35.730
I'm focusing on my job.

07:35.730 --> 07:36.920
And we've been busy with our paper.

07:36.920 --> 07:37.660
So busy.

07:37.660 --> 07:38.820
Yeah, we'll pick a date when we pick a date.

07:38.820 --> 07:40.200
Yeah.

07:40.660 --> 07:42.310
Okay.

07:43.420 --> 07:44.830
You know, I can see why Amy's mad at you.

07:44.830 --> 07:47.600
Yeah, shut up, Sheldon!

07:50.210 --> 07:52.180
Did you eat all my yogurt?

07:52.180 --> 07:53.830
You mean the one that makes ladies do the thing

07:53.830 --> 07:54.990
that ladies pretend they don't do

07:54.990 --> 07:57.510
even though they do?

08:00.200 --> 08:01.510
You know...

08:01.510 --> 08:04.800
which yogurt I mean.

08:04.800 --> 08:07.940
I didn't touch it. Must have been Stuart.

08:08.420 --> 08:09.690
Maybe Raj is right.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.590
Maybe it's time we tell him he needs to move out.

08:11.590 --> 08:13.310
We should have done it months ago.

08:13.310 --> 08:15.550
I know, but his store was reopening,

08:15.550 --> 08:18.180
and then there were the holidays, and then he was sick.

08:18.180 --> 08:19.170
Yeah, right.

08:19.170 --> 08:21.570
Sick. He didn't have jaundice.

08:21.570 --> 08:24.380
He just looks like that.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.860
All right. Tonight's the night.

08:31.860 --> 08:32.620
Agreed.

08:32.620 --> 08:35.260
When he gets home, I'm dropping the hammer.

08:35.260 --> 08:37.100
Ooh, I like when you take charge.

08:37.100 --> 08:40.940
Oh, I'm not taking charge-- you're the hammer.

08:46.930 --> 08:48.140
So...

08:48.140 --> 08:50.190
why haven't we picked a date?

08:50.190 --> 08:51.080
You know why.

08:51.080 --> 08:52.590
Well, of course I know why.

08:52.590 --> 08:55.830
But just for fun... why?

08:55.940 --> 08:58.350
Not in a rush, busy with work...

08:58.350 --> 08:59.600
Things are good right now.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.320
Really good.

09:02.160 --> 09:03.850
You still want to get married, right?

09:03.850 --> 09:05.970
Oh, my God. Yes. Why would you even ask that?

09:05.970 --> 09:08.090
I don't know. Because we don't have a date?

09:08.090 --> 09:09.530
Well, you want a date, pick a date.

09:09.530 --> 09:11.000
It's not just the date.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.590
We haven't talked about anything.

09:12.590 --> 09:14.730
Big wedding, small wedding, indoor, outdoor...

09:14.730 --> 09:16.430
Outdoor? Oh.

09:16.430 --> 09:19.360
I can RSVP no right now.

09:20.300 --> 09:22.180
Okay, indoor it is. Big or small?

09:22.180 --> 09:23.130
Is your dad paying for it?

09:23.130 --> 09:23.790
I doubt it.

09:23.790 --> 09:25.770
Okay, two friends each.

09:27.710 --> 09:29.310
All right, well, I want it in a church.

09:29.310 --> 09:30.710
Fine. I want black-tie.

09:30.710 --> 09:32.270
Fine. I want to release butterflies.

09:32.270 --> 09:35.370
Seriously? Airborne worms?

09:36.690 --> 09:38.870
Okay. Well, then it's settled:

09:38.870 --> 09:41.490
small indoor church wedding, black-tie, no butterflies.

09:41.490 --> 09:43.390
- Sounds perfect. - Great.

09:44.950 --> 09:46.040
You still didn't pick a date.

09:46.040 --> 09:47.770
- Stay out of it! - Shut up!

09:54.570 --> 09:55.990
It's a beautiful night.

09:55.990 --> 09:58.280
Oh, yes, we've got the moon

09:58.280 --> 10:00.330
and the trees and...

10:00.330 --> 10:02.330
Elizabeth McNulty,

10:02.330 --> 10:05.880
who apparently died when she was the same age I am.

10:07.460 --> 10:09.730
Makes you feel alive, doesn't it?

10:09.730 --> 10:12.000
So does enjoying a meal at a well-lit restaurant,

10:12.000 --> 10:13.810
but here we are.

10:16.030 --> 10:17.970
You aren't scared, are you?

10:17.970 --> 10:19.990
Of ghosts, no.

10:19.990 --> 10:22.950
Of you, little bit.

10:25.510 --> 10:27.560
I'm sorry I've upset you.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.460
I shouldn't have asked so many questions.

10:29.460 --> 10:30.630
No, it's okay.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.890
Yeah, maybe it's good you got us talking about this stuff.

10:33.890 --> 10:35.810
Well, look at that--

10:35.810 --> 10:39.200
even when I'm causing problems, I make the world a better place.

10:39.790 --> 10:43.480
Hey, next, why don't we tackle your penchant for whining

10:43.480 --> 10:46.500
and Penny's love of the ol' glug-glug?

10:49.460 --> 10:51.310
Uh, Sheldon, I think we're good for now.

10:51.310 --> 10:52.870
Ah, well... very well.

10:52.870 --> 10:55.270
So does this mean you'll finally pick a wedding date?

10:55.270 --> 10:57.200
Here we go again.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.820
Why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date?

10:59.820 --> 11:01.750
We're committed to each other. We're happy.

11:01.750 --> 11:04.100
A ceremony isn't gonna change anything.

11:04.100 --> 11:06.360
So you're never getting married?

11:07.010 --> 11:09.500
It's his whining, isn't it?

11:09.500 --> 11:12.530
Sheldon, I'm not a whiner.

11:14.360 --> 11:17.570
It's amusing that he doesn't hear it.

11:18.320 --> 11:21.230
Look, all she's saying is we are in love

11:21.230 --> 11:23.660
so it doesn't matter if we get married tomorrow

11:23.660 --> 11:25.970
or a year from now or 50 years from now.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.270
Ew, 50? We'll be old and gross.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.730
Yeah, but we'll be old and gross together.

11:31.730 --> 11:35.280
My aunt and uncle were married 63 years.

11:35.280 --> 11:39.000
Towards the end, it was like watching cheese melt.

11:49.950 --> 11:52.330
Um... I'm free tonight.

11:57.610 --> 11:59.500
Are you saying you want to get married?

11:59.500 --> 12:02.730
Vegas isn't that far away.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.120
I'm in. Let's do it.

12:11.970 --> 12:14.580
After all these years.

12:14.580 --> 12:16.470
I'm really happy for the two of you.

12:16.470 --> 12:18.310
- Oh, thank you. - Thanks.

12:18.310 --> 12:20.630
Now get out of my spot.

12:24.030 --> 12:26.980
Bernie, Stuart just pulled up.

12:27.380 --> 12:28.290
So remember,

12:28.290 --> 12:30.280
the key is to be firm.

12:30.280 --> 12:31.330
Show no weakness.

12:31.330 --> 12:31.900
Right.

12:31.900 --> 12:33.280
Good luck.

12:33.890 --> 12:36.880
Howard Joel Wolowitz, you get back here.

12:38.180 --> 12:40.780
Never should have told you my middle name.

12:40.780 --> 12:41.760
Hey, guys.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.120
Hey, you got a minute?

12:44.120 --> 12:46.420
Sure. Uh, let me just put this stuff in the fridge.

12:46.420 --> 12:49.120
I felt bad for finishing your yogurt, so I bought more.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.430
And, Howard, your favorite fruit is in season.

12:51.430 --> 12:53.520
Crunch Berries.

12:55.220 --> 12:56.650
Don't let that sway you.

12:56.650 --> 12:57.690
It's hard not to.

12:57.690 --> 12:59.870
They taste so much better than real berries.

13:02.080 --> 13:02.970
What's up?

13:03.480 --> 13:06.250
So... we need to talk.

13:09.550 --> 13:11.440
You okay?

13:12.250 --> 13:14.750
I think we should talk.

13:15.100 --> 13:17.410
Is everything okay?

13:17.410 --> 13:20.070
Well... you've been living here a while now.

13:20.070 --> 13:22.960
I know. I may sell comic books at work,

13:22.960 --> 13:24.480
but the real superheroes

13:24.480 --> 13:26.850
are sitting right in front of me.

13:29.290 --> 13:32.000
Yeah...

13:32.000 --> 13:34.490
His middle name is David. Go.

13:36.230 --> 13:38.400
Look, I care about you a lot,

13:38.400 --> 13:41.960
but we are very different people.

13:41.960 --> 13:44.610
Are you breaking up with me?

13:44.610 --> 13:46.780
No, no, I'm just pointing out that

13:46.780 --> 13:50.570
you're dark on the inside and I'm dark on the outside.

13:51.870 --> 13:55.000
So, anyway, what I'm trying to say is...

13:56.940 --> 13:58.220
You need to take that?

13:58.220 --> 13:59.370
It's just my dad, probably calling

13:59.370 --> 14:01.880
to wish me a happy birthday.

14:02.590 --> 14:04.120
I'll call him back.

14:04.620 --> 14:07.120
You were saying?

14:07.640 --> 14:10.940
Look, Raj, be honest with me.

14:10.940 --> 14:12.570
If you want to end things, just do it.

14:12.570 --> 14:15.610
Don't expect me to do it for you.

14:16.030 --> 14:20.250
End things? I'm trying to tell you that I love you.

14:22.520 --> 14:28.960
Happy birthday to you.

14:36.550 --> 14:38.030
Wow, there's a Denny's in Vegas

14:38.030 --> 14:39.650
you can actually get married in.

14:40.090 --> 14:41.660
Doesn't sound very romantic.

14:41.660 --> 14:44.060
Yeah, but we could get heart-shaped pancakes.

14:44.620 --> 14:46.340
I'm sure we'll find a decent chapel.

14:46.340 --> 14:47.450
Yeah.

14:48.480 --> 14:50.550
- This is crazy! - I know!

14:51.790 --> 14:53.190
You think people are gonna be mad?

14:53.190 --> 14:55.960
Maybe. But this isn't about them; it's about us.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.850
It is. It is about us.

14:58.850 --> 15:00.260
And you know what the best part is?

15:00.260 --> 15:02.160
We took our time.

15:02.160 --> 15:05.020
I mean, we met, we were friends for a couple years,

15:05.020 --> 15:08.530
then we got together, and then we got untogether,

15:08.530 --> 15:10.110
then we worked out all our problems,

15:10.110 --> 15:12.450
and now we know everything about each other,

15:12.450 --> 15:14.320
we can just go forward

15:14.320 --> 15:16.360
with no surprises and no regrets.

15:16.360 --> 15:18.840
Right. No surprises.

15:20.240 --> 15:23.170
And no regrets.

15:27.840 --> 15:31.720
Uh, well, there-there's one thing

15:31.720 --> 15:33.870
I feel I should tell you.

15:33.870 --> 15:35.140
What?

15:35.650 --> 15:37.450
You know, so we can go into this

15:37.450 --> 15:39.640
with no secrets between us.

15:39.640 --> 15:41.270
What?

15:44.900 --> 15:46.770
Remember, uh, a couple years back

15:46.770 --> 15:49.580
when I was on that research ship in the North Sea?

15:49.580 --> 15:50.750
Yeah.

15:50.750 --> 15:53.570
Okay, well, there-there was a lot of drinking

15:53.570 --> 15:55.040
and craziness going on...

15:55.040 --> 15:55.830
No, you told me.

15:55.830 --> 15:58.580
Okay, um...

15:59.340 --> 16:02.240
Well, there was this girl.

16:02.760 --> 16:03.600
What did you do?

16:03.600 --> 16:04.960
Nothing...

16:05.680 --> 16:06.390
really.

16:06.390 --> 16:08.230
It was just kissing.

16:08.230 --> 16:09.120
And then what?

16:09.120 --> 16:10.700
And then nothing.

16:10.700 --> 16:12.640
I stopped it.

16:12.640 --> 16:16.900
But it still bothers me, and...

16:18.300 --> 16:21.070
I wanted you to know.

16:23.890 --> 16:26.120
All right.

16:28.160 --> 16:29.810
Did you ever do anything like this since we've been...?

16:29.810 --> 16:30.640
Nope, never.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.850
Oh, that's too bad.

16:34.350 --> 16:35.810
You know, can I ask you a question?

16:36.600 --> 16:38.520
Why are you telling me this now?

16:38.520 --> 16:41.620
Well, like I said, we're about to get married,

16:41.620 --> 16:44.310
and I-I want a clean slate.

16:44.310 --> 16:45.510
No secrets.

16:45.510 --> 16:47.060
Really? Be-Because to me,

16:47.060 --> 16:48.180
it seems like we're about to get married

16:48.180 --> 16:49.870
and you're trying to sabotage it.

16:49.870 --> 16:51.690
W-Would you rather I didn't tell you?

16:51.690 --> 16:53.500
No, I don't want there to be secrets between us.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.690
See, now I'm confused.

16:54.690 --> 16:56.200
I mean, what-what am I supposed to do?

16:56.200 --> 16:58.860
Uh, keep your mouth off other women.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.380
I can do that.

17:01.380 --> 17:01.800
Uh, uh, f-from now on,

17:01.800 --> 17:05.590
this mouth-- you and food, that's it.

17:08.970 --> 17:10.420
Okay.

17:11.220 --> 17:13.280
Yeah?

17:14.200 --> 17:16.540
Look, I'm not happy this happened,

17:16.540 --> 17:18.990
but I think I can get past it.

17:18.990 --> 17:20.790
I mean, we weren't engaged at the time,

17:20.790 --> 17:22.670
and it was just kissing.

17:22.670 --> 17:24.120
Right.

17:24.120 --> 17:25.800
Just kissing.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.640
It wasn't even very good.

17:27.640 --> 17:29.660
She was a smoker. I'd just been seasick...

17:29.660 --> 17:32.120
Okay, that's enough. Stop talking.

17:35.660 --> 17:37.100
So...

17:38.450 --> 17:40.250
we're still getting married?

17:41.890 --> 17:43.670
Yes.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.980
Because we love each other.

17:46.980 --> 17:48.340
Yes.

17:48.620 --> 17:51.150
And it's the happiest day of our lives.

17:51.520 --> 17:53.270
Don't push it.

18:01.920 --> 18:03.050
Hello.

18:03.050 --> 18:04.080
Hello.

18:04.080 --> 18:08.690
Listen, I've been thinking a lot about relationships

18:08.690 --> 18:11.370
and how difficult they can be, and I think...

18:11.370 --> 18:14.280
I've been thinking about them, too, Sheldon.

18:14.910 --> 18:18.500
Being your girlfriend is so challenging.

18:18.500 --> 18:20.130
Emotionally,

18:20.130 --> 18:21.490
physically.

18:21.490 --> 18:26.020
I've been incredibly patient for years.

18:26.020 --> 18:27.710
Strongly disagree.

18:27.710 --> 18:29.590
Go on.

18:30.110 --> 18:32.640
Okay, well...

18:33.410 --> 18:37.100
this isn't easy to say, because I love you,

18:37.100 --> 18:38.540
but...

18:39.650 --> 18:42.740
I need some time to take a step back

18:42.740 --> 18:46.080
and reevaluate our situation.

18:49.540 --> 18:52.860
I hope you understand.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.360
Okay.

18:57.750 --> 19:00.790
Bye, Sheldon.

19:17.880 --> 19:19.820
Well, Gollum...

19:21.830 --> 19:23.960
...you're an expert on rings.

19:25.400 --> 19:28.550
What do I do with this one?
