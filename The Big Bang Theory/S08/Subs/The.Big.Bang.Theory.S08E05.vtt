00:03.970 --> 00:06.630
Hey, I read that someone invented a way

00:06.630 --> 00:09.140
to covert your footsteps into electromagnetic energy,

00:09.140 --> 00:11.240
so you can charge your cell phone while walking.

00:11.240 --> 00:13.020
We had that idea years ago.

00:13.020 --> 00:14.370
How come we never did anything with it?

00:14.370 --> 00:16.820
Probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant,

00:16.820 --> 00:19.440
and none of us wanted to walk back.

00:21.130 --> 00:24.100
I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea.

00:24.100 --> 00:27.350
You thought of it September 22, 2007.

00:27.350 --> 00:29.790
Two days later, Penny moved in,

00:29.790 --> 00:32.030
and so much blood rushed to your genitals,

00:32.030 --> 00:34.200
your brain became a ghost town.

00:36.090 --> 00:37.620
That's not what happened.

00:37.620 --> 00:39.380
I remember it distinctly

00:39.380 --> 00:41.860
because I had just composed my annual poem

00:41.860 --> 00:44.670
commemorating the anniversary of Dr. Seuss's death.

00:44.670 --> 00:45.560
No one wants to hear it.

00:45.560 --> 00:47.170
Why, die.

00:47.410 --> 00:48.670
Why did he die?

00:48.670 --> 00:49.780
Old, told.

00:49.780 --> 00:52.150
I was told he was old.

00:52.970 --> 00:55.530
Penny is not the reason I didn't pursue that idea.

00:55.530 --> 00:57.610
Oh, really? Since meeting her,

00:57.610 --> 01:00.140
what have been your greatest accomplishments?

01:00.140 --> 01:00.990
Easy.

01:00.990 --> 01:02.800
Sleeping with Penny.

01:02.930 --> 01:05.590
Getting Penny to go back out with him after she dumped him.

01:05.590 --> 01:07.300
Tricking Penny into getting engaged.

01:07.300 --> 01:11.430
And a few weeks ago, he almost did a pull-up.

01:13.110 --> 01:15.720
I think someone owes me an apology.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.120
Well, don't feel bad.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.740
I think we've all been distracted

01:19.740 --> 01:21.800
since the girls entered our lives.

01:21.800 --> 01:23.410
You admit Amy's a distraction?

01:23.410 --> 01:25.010
Oh, very much so.

01:25.170 --> 01:27.950
Listen to this. This is from two days ago.

01:27.950 --> 01:31.000
"Hi. Hope you're having a good day."

01:31.000 --> 01:34.580
Who has time for this constant sexting?

01:35.250 --> 01:37.580
Well, maybe we have lost our focus.

01:37.580 --> 01:41.330
It wouldn't kill us to get together and brainstorm ideas.

01:41.330 --> 01:43.620
Ooh, we could have one of those retreats.

01:43.620 --> 01:45.220
Like our own science retreat.

01:45.260 --> 01:47.120
My cousin has a cabin out in the woods.

01:47.120 --> 01:49.730
I'm not going to a cabin in the woods.

01:49.730 --> 01:53.050
Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods?

01:53.050 --> 01:54.400
Then we'll go to a hotel.

01:54.400 --> 01:58.970
A hotel? Did you see The Shining?

01:58.970 --> 02:00.140
We could go up to Big Bear

02:00.140 --> 02:01.230
and get a house on the lake.

02:01.230 --> 02:04.110
Did you see The Lake House?

02:04.110 --> 02:06.440
Nothing bad happens in The Lake House.

02:06.440 --> 02:09.250
Yeah, well, no, not to them. To me.

02:09.780 --> 02:11.400
Time traveling mailbox.

02:11.400 --> 02:12.140
The only time that traveled

02:12.140 --> 02:15.000
was an hour and half of my life down the toilet.

02:15.140 --> 02:16.940
Fine. Then we'll just stay here and do it.

02:16.940 --> 02:18.620
Well, you didn't suggest a beach house.

02:18.620 --> 02:19.850
You would go to a beach house?

02:19.850 --> 02:22.820
Well, good Lord, no-- have you seen Jaws?

02:49.940 --> 02:51.240
So, the guys and I are talking about

02:51.240 --> 02:53.540
having kind of a science retreat this weekend.

02:53.540 --> 02:55.390
I just wanted to know if that's okay.

02:55.390 --> 02:57.300
You and I had talked about going to brunch on Sunday...

02:57.300 --> 02:58.310
Want to go to Vegas this weekend?

02:58.310 --> 02:59.610
Of course I do.

03:00.250 --> 03:00.730
Bernadette?

03:00.730 --> 03:02.020
Girl's weekend. Vegas. You in?

03:02.020 --> 03:03.820
- Hell, yeah! - Yes!

03:03.820 --> 03:05.640
- I'll check flights. - I'll check hotels.

03:05.640 --> 03:06.660
I'll check my underpants.

03:06.660 --> 03:08.840
I'm so excited, I think I peed.

03:17.680 --> 03:19.210
They seem okay with it.

03:25.720 --> 03:26.900
I didn't think you'd make it.

03:26.910 --> 03:27.600
Why not?

03:27.600 --> 03:29.390
Well, 'cause you have a steady girlfriend now,

03:29.390 --> 03:30.650
and we assumed you'd have to stay home

03:30.650 --> 03:33.180
to lower the food down to her in the pit.

03:37.520 --> 03:40.730
For your information, Emily is working tonight.

03:40.730 --> 03:43.930
Yeah, one would assume, on getting out of the pit.

03:45.540 --> 03:46.850
Okay, let's focus.

03:46.850 --> 03:48.380
The girls are gone, we have 48 hours.

03:48.380 --> 03:49.650
There are no distractions.

03:49.650 --> 03:51.200
Let's change the world.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.170
Thinking caps on. Here we go.

03:53.170 --> 03:55.410
Ooh, this is exciting. We're innovating.

03:55.410 --> 03:57.160
I feel like we're in the Facebook movie.

03:57.740 --> 03:58.840
Oh. I never saw that.

03:58.840 --> 04:00.360
Yeah. Really?

04:00.360 --> 04:02.470
It's wonderful, and I swear I'm not saying that

04:02.470 --> 04:05.030
because Justin Timberlake is in it.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.650
Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray.

04:07.650 --> 04:09.310
We should watch it.

04:09.310 --> 04:12.150
Cool. I'll make the popcorn.

04:12.650 --> 04:13.580
Guys...

04:13.580 --> 04:15.070
in 30 seconds, we went from

04:15.070 --> 04:17.860
"Let's change the world" to "Let's watch TV."

04:18.790 --> 04:21.160
I'm sorry. Is that a "no"?

04:21.850 --> 04:22.550
Okay. No. Leonard's right.

04:22.550 --> 04:23.650
We're here to focus.

04:23.710 --> 04:25.490
Didn't we used to have a list of all our ideas?

04:25.490 --> 04:27.260
I-I think I still have it.

04:27.260 --> 04:28.930
I did not get a clear answer.

04:28.930 --> 04:31.010
I'm gonna set this down now.

04:32.080 --> 04:33.730
Ah, here it is.

04:35.420 --> 04:37.210
I haven't looked at these in years.

04:37.570 --> 04:38.990
"Robot girlfriend."

04:38.990 --> 04:40.800
Mm, that was mine.

04:42.120 --> 04:44.370
"Robot prostitute."

04:45.300 --> 04:47.270
Also mine.

04:47.270 --> 04:48.290
Wait. I'm confused.

04:48.290 --> 04:50.010
Why would you need both a robot girlfriend

04:50.010 --> 04:51.780
and a robot prostitute?

04:51.780 --> 04:56.450
There's just some things you don't do with your robot girlfriend.

04:57.730 --> 04:58.980
Boy, when you met Bernadette,

04:58.980 --> 05:02.040
the field of robotics really took a hit.

05:02.730 --> 05:06.370
Okay, let's just skip all the inventions you can have sex with.

05:13.330 --> 05:14.590
All right, no... here we go:

05:14.590 --> 05:16.290
"Ergonomic heated seat cushion."

05:16.290 --> 05:18.280
No, it vibrates. Keep going.

05:21.890 --> 05:23.990
You know, let's just come up with something new.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.220
You know, a number of significant innovations

05:26.220 --> 05:28.120
have been inspired by science fiction.

05:28.120 --> 05:31.500
The-the geosynchronous satellite from Arthur C. Clarke.

05:31.500 --> 05:34.260
The Motorola flip phone-- that came from Star Trek.

05:34.260 --> 05:36.660
Yeah, and I've long suspected that the idea

05:36.660 --> 05:38.800
of an African-American president was stolen

05:38.800 --> 05:42.150
from the movie Deep Impact.

05:43.580 --> 05:46.780
Hey, the future they show in Back to the Future II

05:46.780 --> 05:48.660
is only a year away.

05:48.660 --> 05:50.820
A lot of the things in that movie haven't been invented yet.

05:50.820 --> 05:52.000
How cool would that be

05:52.000 --> 05:53.570
if we could make one of those a reality?

05:53.570 --> 05:55.380
If we could figure out the scientific basis

05:55.380 --> 05:56.810
for Marty's hover board,

05:56.810 --> 05:59.060
that would have universal application.

05:59.060 --> 06:01.230
Well, it's-it's possible at absolute zero,

06:01.230 --> 06:04.250
but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions.

06:04.250 --> 06:05.700
Oh, I have an idea.

06:05.700 --> 06:07.010
I think I have the same one.

06:07.010 --> 06:09.330
We got to watch Back to the Future II!

06:11.190 --> 06:13.540
I'll make the popcorn.

06:15.740 --> 06:17.520
So, where should we go first?

06:18.050 --> 06:19.970
There's a cover band in the lounge.

06:19.970 --> 06:22.170
- Nah. - But they play Barry Manilow.

06:22.170 --> 06:25.990
- No. - But they're called "Fairly Manilow."

06:27.220 --> 06:28.230
Oh. Okay.

06:28.230 --> 06:30.040
- Great! - No!

06:31.210 --> 06:32.270
Well, what do you want to do?

06:32.270 --> 06:33.830
Well, we're in Vegas.

06:33.830 --> 06:36.430
I want to go downstairs, get a bucket of margaritas,

06:36.430 --> 06:38.810
dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel

06:38.810 --> 06:40.570
and watch it go everywhere.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.080
What if we don't want to vomit?

06:43.080 --> 06:45.740
Oh, you will. That's why they give you the bucket.

06:47.970 --> 06:48.850
What?

06:48.850 --> 06:50.350
It's my boss.

06:50.350 --> 06:52.520
They moved my field ride up to Monday.

06:52.520 --> 06:53.630
What does that mean?

06:53.630 --> 06:55.410
It means instead of having a week to study,

06:55.410 --> 06:56.900
I only have two days.

06:56.900 --> 06:58.070
That sucks.

06:58.070 --> 06:59.770
Can you start in the morning?

06:59.770 --> 07:01.510
Uh, it's kind of a lot.

07:01.510 --> 07:02.660
You know, let me do a little tonight,

07:02.660 --> 07:04.100
and I'll catch up with you guys later.

07:04.100 --> 07:06.240
- You sure? - Yeah, it's okay. Go ahead.

07:08.420 --> 07:10.390
So, um, now that Penny's not coming...

07:10.390 --> 07:12.500
- We're not seeing Fairly Manilow. - Okay.

07:19.920 --> 07:21.690
Hold on. Pause.

07:21.690 --> 07:24.230
Something doesn't make sense. Look...

07:25.410 --> 07:28.690
In 2015, Biff steals the sports almanac

07:28.690 --> 07:32.470
and takes the time machine back to 1955,

07:32.470 --> 07:34.130
to give it to his younger self.

07:34.130 --> 07:37.160
But as soon as he does that, he changes the future,

07:37.160 --> 07:39.410
so the 2015 he returns to would be

07:39.410 --> 07:43.970
a different 2015, not the 2015 that Marty and Doc were in.

07:43.970 --> 07:48.900
This is Hot Tub Time Machine all over again.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.900
If future Biff goes back to 2015

07:51.900 --> 07:54.010
right after he gives young Biff the almanac,

07:54.010 --> 07:57.100
he could get back to the 2015 with Marty and Doc in it.

07:57.100 --> 08:00.000
Because it wasn't until his 21st birthday

08:00.000 --> 08:03.060
that 1955 Biff placed his first bet.

08:03.060 --> 08:03.880
Wait. Whoa, whoa.

08:03.880 --> 08:05.510
Is "placed" right?

08:05.510 --> 08:06.340
What do you mean?

08:06.340 --> 08:08.500
Is "placed" the right tense

08:08.500 --> 08:10.580
for something that would have happened in the future

08:10.580 --> 08:14.000
of a past that was affected by something from the future?

08:15.420 --> 08:17.920
Had will have placed?

08:17.920 --> 08:20.090
That's my boy.

08:21.930 --> 08:24.970
Okay, so, it wasn't until his 21st birthday

08:24.970 --> 08:27.410
that Biff had will have placed his first bet

08:27.410 --> 08:28.570
and made his millions.

08:28.570 --> 08:30.720
That's when he altered the timeline.

08:30.720 --> 08:34.060
Yeah, but he had will haven't placed it!

08:36.260 --> 08:37.950
What?!

08:38.420 --> 08:40.030
Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine,

08:40.030 --> 08:41.930
this couldn't be more simple.

08:41.930 --> 08:44.490
When Biff gets the almanac in 1955,

08:44.490 --> 08:47.110
the alternate future he creates isn't the one

08:47.110 --> 08:49.630
in which Marty and Doc Brown ever use the time machine

08:49.630 --> 08:51.140
to travel to 2015.

08:51.140 --> 08:51.990
Therefore,

08:51.990 --> 08:53.240
in the new timeline,

08:53.240 --> 08:55.510
Marty and Doc never brought the time machine...

08:55.510 --> 08:56.360
W-Wait.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.010
Is "brought" right?

09:02.310 --> 09:06.420
Marty and Doc never had have had brought?

09:07.710 --> 09:09.680
I don't know. You did it to me.

09:11.510 --> 09:12.630
Oh, I'm going with it.

09:12.630 --> 09:14.900
Marty and Doc never had have had brought

09:14.900 --> 09:16.880
the time machine to 2015.

09:16.880 --> 09:19.800
That means 2015 Biff could also

09:19.800 --> 09:23.900
not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 Biff.

09:23.900 --> 09:28.390
Therefore, the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac

09:28.390 --> 09:29.720
is also the timeline

09:29.720 --> 09:32.780
in which 1955 Biff never gets the almanac.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.360
And not just "never gets."

09:34.360 --> 09:35.900
Never have, never hasn't,

09:35.900 --> 09:38.360
never had have hasn't.

09:43.890 --> 09:45.240
He's right.

09:46.960 --> 09:49.590
Also, what kind of name is Biff?

09:49.590 --> 09:52.590
Sounds like when you pop open a can of Pillsbury dough.

09:53.270 --> 09:54.650
Biff.

09:56.410 --> 09:59.320
Oh, that stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail weenies.

09:59.320 --> 09:59.940
Guys...

09:59.940 --> 10:01.490
Do you know that the word "Wiener"

10:01.490 --> 10:04.180
comes from the German name of the Austrian capital Vienna,

10:04.180 --> 10:05.100
or "Wien"?

10:05.100 --> 10:06.340
Do you know if you look at Austria on a map

10:06.340 --> 10:08.180
it actually looks like a wiener?

10:09.350 --> 10:10.400
Guys, what are we doing?

10:10.400 --> 10:11.580
W-We sent the girls away

10:11.580 --> 10:13.320
so we could focus.

10:13.950 --> 10:15.950
I don't think it worked.

10:27.290 --> 10:30.740
Maybe after this, you'll be in the mood for some Manilow.

10:31.540 --> 10:33.820
I think after this, I'll be dead.

10:35.020 --> 10:36.440
Look at us out,

10:36.440 --> 10:38.580
while Penny's in the room studying.

10:38.580 --> 10:39.650
I'm proud of her.

10:39.650 --> 10:40.750
This is a great opportunity.

10:40.750 --> 10:42.580
It's nice to see her take it seriously.

10:42.580 --> 10:43.480
It is.

10:43.480 --> 10:44.220
But enough about Penny.

10:44.220 --> 10:46.230
Let's talk about us.

10:47.160 --> 10:48.930
We're looking good.

10:49.820 --> 10:50.870
We are...

10:51.270 --> 10:52.640
Better than good.

10:52.640 --> 10:55.740
I mean, look at you. Your body's bangin'!

10:56.610 --> 10:57.410
Amy!

10:57.410 --> 10:58.290
Don't "Amy" me.

10:58.290 --> 11:00.220
We're always talking about how hot Penny is.

11:00.220 --> 11:02.730
Come on-- scientist to scientist,

11:02.730 --> 11:06.140
how big are those Hadron Colliders?

11:08.470 --> 11:10.000
You're embarrassing me.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.150
Oh, don't be embarrassed.

11:11.150 --> 11:13.930
I'll show you the divot in my spine.

11:13.930 --> 11:16.430
- What? - No, no, it's okay. I was born with it.

11:16.430 --> 11:17.990
If you put a double-A battery in there,

11:17.990 --> 11:20.160
it makes my leg kick.

11:23.800 --> 11:24.620
All right.

11:24.620 --> 11:26.320
Oh, this is already better.

11:26.320 --> 11:28.680
There are far fewer distractions in here.

11:28.680 --> 11:29.710
Plus, this is where our minds

11:29.710 --> 11:31.470
are conditioned to focus on work.

11:31.470 --> 11:33.430
So, I've been thinking about the hover boards,

11:33.430 --> 11:36.030
and maybe there's a way we could use maglev technology.

11:36.030 --> 11:38.830
Or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials,

11:38.830 --> 11:40.480
we could utilize quantum coupling.

11:40.480 --> 11:42.480
Well, I wonder if anyone's tried that.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.250
Go online and look it up.

11:44.250 --> 11:45.630
Oh, I can't argue with him.

11:45.630 --> 11:47.150
It's right there on the screen.

11:47.150 --> 11:49.860
Austria does look like a wiener.

11:51.810 --> 11:52.860
That's nothing, dude.

11:52.860 --> 11:55.480
Go check out how hung Florida is.

11:57.420 --> 11:59.270
I'm sure Mrs. Florida's walking funny.

11:59.270 --> 12:00.760
Can we get back to work?

12:01.720 --> 12:03.730
Yeah... he's right.

12:03.730 --> 12:05.830
Oh, here's a thought.

12:05.830 --> 12:09.240
What if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques

12:09.240 --> 12:11.180
to keep us from getting off topic?

12:11.180 --> 12:12.840
Like behavior modification?

12:12.840 --> 12:14.040
Yeah, exactly.

12:14.290 --> 12:16.090
Did you know those techniques

12:16.090 --> 12:19.400
were used to actually teach pigeons to play ping-pong?

12:19.440 --> 12:21.230
That cannot be true.

12:31.030 --> 12:33.220
Hey, it was match point.

12:35.140 --> 12:36.560
Some psychologists

12:36.560 --> 12:38.630
perform operant conditioning with punishment.

12:38.630 --> 12:40.140
Maybe we can come up with a punishment

12:40.140 --> 12:42.350
for straying off topic.

12:42.350 --> 12:46.320
Not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong comes to mind.

12:47.310 --> 12:49.050
We could snap a rubber band on our wrists

12:49.050 --> 12:51.190
every time we get sidetracked.

12:51.190 --> 12:54.270
Mmm, not bad. You know, in medieval times,

12:54.270 --> 12:56.550
idle chatter was punished with a device called

12:56.550 --> 12:58.190
the scold's bridle.

12:58.190 --> 12:59.980
It's an iron cage

12:59.980 --> 13:03.460
that's locked around the head and pierces the tongue.

13:04.020 --> 13:06.310
If only we had one.

13:08.190 --> 13:10.300
Oh! I'll check Amazon.

13:15.990 --> 13:18.040
Housekeeping!

13:20.690 --> 13:21.800
We had a complaint

13:21.800 --> 13:25.310
about somebody pooping on a party in there!

13:27.760 --> 13:30.600
It was us the whole time!

13:31.070 --> 13:33.230
Why'd you tell her? It was working.

13:33.230 --> 13:34.960
Was it working?

13:34.960 --> 13:36.680
Yeah.

13:36.680 --> 13:39.720
Oh, I'm so sorry.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.270
You guys look like you're having fun.

13:42.270 --> 13:44.410
We're having the best time.

13:44.700 --> 13:48.470
Guess who won $100 playing craps.

13:48.470 --> 13:49.970
That's a dollar.

13:50.710 --> 13:54.060
Then guess who wildly overtipped a cocktail waitress.

13:54.430 --> 13:56.140
Hey, Penny... hey, let's go.

13:56.140 --> 13:59.880
We found a place that has Australian male strippers.

13:59.880 --> 14:04.270
We want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction.

14:13.820 --> 14:15.310
That sounds so great.

14:15.310 --> 14:17.760
But I have a little more studying to do.

14:17.760 --> 14:20.750
Can you believe this nerd?

14:22.230 --> 14:24.290
Come on, do you want to sit here being a loser,

14:24.290 --> 14:25.710
or do you want to watch me climb into

14:25.710 --> 14:30.250
an Australian man's G-string like a baby kangaroo?

14:35.360 --> 14:37.700
All right, guys, look, I would love to go out,

14:37.700 --> 14:39.240
but I've got to get this done, okay?

14:39.240 --> 14:40.750
So have fun at the club.

14:40.750 --> 14:43.100
And if you get in trouble, find a policeman.

14:43.100 --> 14:44.310
And if he's taking off his pants,

14:44.310 --> 14:46.740
he is not a real policeman.

14:47.180 --> 14:50.580
Okay, okay, this is obviously very important to her.

14:50.580 --> 14:54.010
Let's just, we'll help her study so she can get done quicker.

14:54.010 --> 14:55.770
Here... here, I'm gonna quiz you.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.300
I'm gonna quiz you.

14:58.620 --> 15:00.520
I got your notes!

15:00.520 --> 15:01.920
I got your notes!

15:01.920 --> 15:02.890
I got your notes!

15:02.890 --> 15:03.830
If you want these,

15:03.830 --> 15:06.380
they're gonna be at the strip club!

15:08.630 --> 15:10.050
Aren't you gonna chase her?

15:10.050 --> 15:12.370
To the walk-in closet? Sure.

15:20.340 --> 15:21.510
Okay, so we agree,

15:21.510 --> 15:22.900
whenever someone takes us off topic

15:22.900 --> 15:25.320
they get their arm hair yanked off.

15:26.080 --> 15:27.120
And I really can't let that happen

15:27.120 --> 15:28.510
or the girl who does my eyebrows will think

15:28.510 --> 15:30.440
I've been cheating on her.

15:31.770 --> 15:34.810
All right, now, one benefit of quantum coupling...

15:34.810 --> 15:35.930
Wait, no, question:

15:35.930 --> 15:38.350
who decides if someone's gone off topic?

15:38.350 --> 15:40.970
I think it'll be pretty clear. If not, we'll take a vote.

15:40.970 --> 15:42.270
Oh, and also...

15:45.610 --> 15:47.130
W-We didn't vote!

15:47.130 --> 15:49.440
We didn't have to-- that was clearly a tangent.

15:49.440 --> 15:50.940
Now come on. Back to work.

15:50.940 --> 15:52.770
If we're leaning towards quantum coupling...

15:53.240 --> 15:54.770
Why?

15:55.290 --> 15:56.830
You said "quantum coupling."

15:56.830 --> 15:58.980
That made me think of the show Quantum Leap.

15:58.980 --> 16:01.450
That's a tangent and it's your fault.

16:01.450 --> 16:02.460
That's ridiculous.

16:02.460 --> 16:04.220
Sheldon, I vote that is not a tangent.

16:04.220 --> 16:07.310
Thank you. And now I owe you one.

16:08.610 --> 16:09.830
That was your fault.

16:11.760 --> 16:13.860
Ooh, that is a lot of hair.

16:16.570 --> 16:19.090
And now I'm gonna hear it from Jenny.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.280
Everyone stop.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.730
This was a stupid idea.

16:22.730 --> 16:24.990
Negative reinforcement isn't working.

16:24.990 --> 16:26.900
I think you mean positive punishment.

16:26.900 --> 16:30.130
Negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus.

16:30.130 --> 16:31.690
It's a common mistake.

16:31.690 --> 16:33.820
Negative reinforcement is really wrong?

16:33.820 --> 16:35.670
Oh, it's used incorrectly all the time.

16:35.670 --> 16:37.550
Even Bill Murray makes that mistake

16:37.550 --> 16:39.440
in the first scene of Ghostbusters.

16:39.440 --> 16:42.660
No way. Not Bill Murray.

16:43.360 --> 16:45.740
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement

16:45.740 --> 16:47.780
on ESP ability.

16:48.500 --> 16:51.030
Bill Murray did get it wrong.

16:51.850 --> 16:53.600
Jump ahead to the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

16:53.600 --> 16:54.640
No!

16:56.230 --> 16:57.370
Leonard's right.

16:57.370 --> 16:58.900
We can't just jump ahead.

16:58.900 --> 17:01.220
- We have to watch the whole movie. - Look.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.710
We keep procrastinating.

17:03.710 --> 17:05.190
We saw Back to the Future II,

17:05.190 --> 17:06.390
pigeons playing ping-pong,

17:06.390 --> 17:08.290
a bunch of countries that look like genitals

17:08.290 --> 17:11.580
and one guy whose genitals look like Denmark!

17:12.570 --> 17:15.120
Yeah, sorry for clicking on that.

17:16.950 --> 17:18.990
It's late. We've wasted hours.

17:18.990 --> 17:20.570
Can we please find it in ourselves

17:20.570 --> 17:22.540
to do any amount of work tonight?

17:22.540 --> 17:26.120
But we didn't see them bust one ghost.

17:27.710 --> 17:30.040
So y-you're saying we should stand here

17:30.040 --> 17:31.930
in my lab on a Saturday night

17:31.930 --> 17:35.070
and watch the rest of Ghostbusters on a crappy laptop?

17:35.070 --> 17:36.360
No.

17:42.390 --> 17:44.860
Go, busters.

17:46.850 --> 17:48.940
It really does hold up.

17:58.610 --> 18:01.210
See? Isn't this better than a hotel room?

18:01.210 --> 18:04.370
Yep. Shake that thing!

18:05.060 --> 18:08.410
Have you ever seen a body so fine?

18:08.410 --> 18:11.180
We had some pretty hot corpses in my anatomy class,

18:11.180 --> 18:13.620
but none of them moved like that!

18:25.030 --> 18:27.020
Good morning.

18:27.020 --> 18:28.550
You want to go to the pool?

18:31.670 --> 18:34.140
Come on... you said it yourself.

18:34.140 --> 18:37.500
Only nerds and losers stay in the room.

18:40.190 --> 18:41.670
Wow, it's bright out.

18:41.670 --> 18:42.900
Isn't it bright?

18:42.900 --> 18:44.580
I should probably close these curtains.

18:44.580 --> 18:46.810
Nah. Bye!

18:48.180 --> 18:50.080
Would you please close the drapes?

18:50.080 --> 18:51.790
Okay.
