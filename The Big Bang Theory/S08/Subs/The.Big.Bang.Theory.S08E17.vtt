WEBVTT

00:03.860 --> 00:05.410
I was unstoppable.

00:05.410 --> 00:06.680
I mean, I was... I was on fire.

00:06.680 --> 00:10.140
It was like my mind and my body were totally connected,

00:10.140 --> 00:13.700
like-like athletes must feel when they're in the zone.

00:14.290 --> 00:17.470
Again, it was miniature golf.

00:18.170 --> 00:20.540
Admit it, you're a little turned on.

00:20.590 --> 00:22.330
You can't be this proud.

00:22.330 --> 00:23.150
Why not?

00:23.150 --> 00:26.190
Because I beat you.

00:29.170 --> 00:30.860
Oh, good. You're back.

00:30.860 --> 00:34.240
We have some exciting news.

00:34.690 --> 00:36.390
Okay.

00:36.390 --> 00:40.360
As you know, Amy and I have been together a long time,

00:40.360 --> 00:44.260
and a lot of things I never thought possible

00:44.260 --> 00:46.830
now seem possible.

00:46.830 --> 00:49.130
Okay...

00:49.600 --> 00:52.490
After a careful evaluation of our relationship,

00:52.490 --> 00:54.940
we decided that the time was right to

00:54.940 --> 00:57.630
take a step forward.

01:02.620 --> 01:04.740
Okay.

01:06.250 --> 01:07.990
Do you want to say it?

01:07.990 --> 01:10.180
Let's say it together.

01:10.180 --> 01:12.860
We're getting a turtle!

01:16.330 --> 01:20.290
This is why I've been saying we should keep champagne on ice.

01:20.890 --> 01:22.300
- Sarcasm? - Yes.

01:22.300 --> 01:23.010
Okay.

01:23.010 --> 01:24.980
That was tricky, 'cause when it comes to alcohol,

01:24.980 --> 01:27.770
she generally means business.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.660
- Well, we're-we're very happy for you. - Yes.

01:30.660 --> 01:31.680
Thank you.

01:31.680 --> 01:34.730
Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.

01:34.730 --> 01:35.940
No. It's true.

01:35.940 --> 01:38.140
It means that we care so much about each other,

01:38.140 --> 01:41.930
there's enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile.

01:42.350 --> 01:43.560
Why a turtle?

01:43.560 --> 01:46.870
After much deliberation, we've determined that a turtle

01:46.870 --> 01:48.480
is the ideal pet.

01:48.480 --> 01:51.540
They don't shed fur, they don't make noise...

01:51.540 --> 01:54.430
For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone.

01:55.340 --> 01:59.350
And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him.

01:59.350 --> 02:02.840
Coincidentally, that's also why I chose you as a roommate.

02:03.700 --> 02:05.320
Well, congratulations.

02:05.320 --> 02:06.600
Who would've thought you two would be the first

02:06.600 --> 02:09.030
in our group to start a family?

02:09.570 --> 02:11.660
That's what I said!

02:38.100 --> 02:40.090
So, where's your roommate tonight?

02:40.090 --> 02:41.940
Well, I thought it was a little unfair

02:41.940 --> 02:43.100
that she's always here,

02:43.100 --> 02:45.310
and you never get a chance to stay over, so...

02:45.450 --> 02:47.220
I killed her.

02:49.460 --> 02:50.810
But remember our agreement?

02:50.810 --> 02:52.530
You can joke about murdering people,

02:52.530 --> 02:56.050
but you have to say, "just kidding."

02:56.050 --> 02:58.050
And the more important thing to remember is

02:58.050 --> 03:00.540
that I'd never hurt you.

03:06.990 --> 03:08.520
Oh, crap.

03:08.520 --> 03:11.310
I have to run over to the hospital and check on a patient.

03:11.310 --> 03:13.070
That's okay. I can come back later.

03:13.070 --> 03:14.910
No. No, don't be silly.

03:14.910 --> 03:17.170
I won't be gone long. Just stay here.

03:17.170 --> 03:18.590
Okay, cool.

03:18.590 --> 03:20.420
Oh, and you're sure your roommate's not gonna come back

03:20.420 --> 03:21.420
while I'm here alone, right?

03:21.420 --> 03:22.850
'Cause that'll be awkward.

03:22.850 --> 03:24.530
Oh, don't worry. She's in Palm Springs.

03:24.530 --> 03:25.570
Oh, good.

03:25.570 --> 03:28.000
Well, her torso is.

03:29.460 --> 03:31.370
Just kidding.

03:32.100 --> 03:34.280
I put her in a wood chipper.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.800
Oh, dear Lord. Oh, dear Lord.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.040
It's okay.

03:41.580 --> 03:42.840
You made it. We're fine.

03:42.840 --> 03:45.400
That was a lot of puppies.

03:47.850 --> 03:49.460
Let's forget about them, and...

03:49.900 --> 03:51.720
pick ourselves out a nice turtle.

03:51.720 --> 03:53.840
Oh, how about this one up on the log?

03:53.840 --> 03:56.340
Oh, I don't know.

03:56.340 --> 03:58.930
He kind of looks like a jerk.

04:00.360 --> 04:02.120
How about this one?

04:02.120 --> 04:04.520
Well, he's barely moving. He looks half dead.

04:04.520 --> 04:07.520
I know. I like him, too.

04:09.480 --> 04:11.400
Hi, little guy.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.720
How'd you like to come home with us?

04:13.720 --> 04:15.410
You'll be living with me

04:15.410 --> 04:17.770
because we don't live in the same house.

04:17.770 --> 04:19.140
But that's not your fault.

04:19.140 --> 04:23.150
Like you, we're taking it ridiculously slow.

04:24.940 --> 04:28.830
You'll stay with me when he's at Comic-Con or away for work.

04:28.830 --> 04:33.670
Or if they accept Daddy's application to live on Mars.

04:34.330 --> 04:36.300
What are you talking about?

04:36.300 --> 04:37.580
Oh, there's this company

04:37.580 --> 04:40.350
that's attempting to establish a colony on Mars,

04:40.350 --> 04:42.630
and I applied to be among the first to go.

04:42.630 --> 04:44.560
What should we name him?

04:44.560 --> 04:48.120
You know, I came in thinking "Seth," but...

04:48.670 --> 04:51.750
he kind of looks Italian.

04:52.130 --> 04:53.960
You applied for a mission

04:53.960 --> 04:55.870
to be a colonist on another planet,

04:55.870 --> 04:58.590
and couldn't be bothered to tell me?

05:00.110 --> 05:01.530
Would you have approved?

05:01.530 --> 05:03.150
Of course not.

05:03.150 --> 05:05.250
Well, based on your reaction,

05:05.250 --> 05:08.030
it looks like I made the right choice.

05:08.530 --> 05:11.370
Isn't that right, Giuseppe?

05:16.610 --> 05:19.260
Listen, I-I have a little confession to make.

05:19.260 --> 05:22.840
Aw, is this your first time?

05:24.510 --> 05:27.420
No, I got you something for Valentine's Day,

05:27.420 --> 05:29.300
and I was too embarrassed to give it to you.

05:29.300 --> 05:30.680
Well, why?

05:30.680 --> 05:34.990
Well, 'cause I got it at the dirty store.

05:35.290 --> 05:38.410
You went to the dirty store without me?!

05:39.490 --> 05:42.650
In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away.

05:42.650 --> 05:44.280
Well, get it! Get it for me!

05:44.280 --> 05:45.360
- Yeah? - Yeah.

05:45.360 --> 05:47.650
Okay, uh, well, I hope it's fun.

05:47.650 --> 05:49.630
I mean, it-it comes with paints, and-and

05:49.630 --> 05:52.070
it's kind of creative and artistic.

05:52.070 --> 05:55.610
Okay, did you go to the dirty store or Michaels?

05:57.430 --> 05:58.090
No, no.

05:58.090 --> 06:00.070
We cover ourselves in body paint,

06:00.070 --> 06:04.420
and then-then we get on this big canvas and do our thing.

06:04.420 --> 06:06.190
Whoa, that's kind of a big step for a guy

06:06.190 --> 06:09.810
who only recently agreed to take his socks off.

06:10.180 --> 06:11.520
You're making fun of me. Forget it.

06:11.520 --> 06:13.120
No! No, come on, I want to do it.

06:13.120 --> 06:14.480
- Really? - Yeah,

06:14.480 --> 06:15.650
let's you, me,

06:15.650 --> 06:19.030
and your very, very pale feet make some art.

06:19.460 --> 06:21.610
Hey, when you got back to this store, I want to go with you.

06:21.610 --> 06:23.020
Okay, but it's a drive--

06:23.020 --> 06:25.330
the one I went to is in San Diego.

06:28.090 --> 06:30.050
How are the taxes going?

06:30.440 --> 06:31.360
Okay.

06:31.360 --> 06:35.310
But you got a lot of receipts for the Lego store in here.

06:36.240 --> 06:37.770
Those are business expenses.

06:37.770 --> 06:39.840
You can write those off.

06:40.630 --> 06:44.600
A $200 R2-D2 is a business expense?

06:45.240 --> 06:46.240
Oh, Bernie,

06:46.240 --> 06:48.030
you're gonna have to sound a lot more confident

06:48.030 --> 06:50.050
when we get audited.

06:54.930 --> 06:56.700
Hey, what's up?

06:56.700 --> 06:58.320
Eh, Emily ran back to the hospital,

06:58.320 --> 07:00.550
so I'm just hanging out at her place.

07:00.550 --> 07:02.280
What are you, uh, what are you doing?

07:02.280 --> 07:06.220
Just playing video games while Bernie does the taxes.

07:06.220 --> 07:08.220
What are you, a little kid?

07:08.220 --> 07:11.830
Is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces, too?

07:12.060 --> 07:16.550
She doesn't have to-- I filled up on jelly beans.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.150
So, uh, what game are you...

07:20.550 --> 07:22.580
Crap.

07:22.850 --> 07:23.600
What's wrong?

07:23.600 --> 07:25.780
I can't get Emily's nightstand to close.

07:25.780 --> 07:26.760
So?

07:26.760 --> 07:28.790
She's gonna know I was looking in it.

07:28.790 --> 07:30.940
Why were you looking in it?

07:30.940 --> 07:31.690
Well, there's a question

07:31.690 --> 07:34.420
I better have a good answer to before she gets back.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.240
Okay, calm down.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.740
There's probably something jammed behind it.

07:37.740 --> 07:40.020
Just, uh, pull it out and see what's there.

07:40.020 --> 07:41.030
Hang on.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.480
Oh... no. Oh, no.

07:47.480 --> 07:49.650
Oh, God, no!

07:50.270 --> 07:53.050
You know what, you sound busy-- I'm gonna let you go.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.600
Dude, the whole front came off.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.550
Now she's gonna know I was snooping.

07:57.550 --> 07:58.700
What's happening?

07:58.700 --> 08:02.250
Raj was snooping through Emily's drawers and broke one.

08:03.090 --> 08:04.970
I'm gonna miss her.

08:07.780 --> 08:09.960
So what do you think?

08:10.760 --> 08:12.860
I thought it'd be a little more...

08:13.760 --> 08:15.830
just more.

08:19.160 --> 08:22.230
I'm not even sure why we were out of breath.

08:23.340 --> 08:26.770
Uh, I mean, d-did we move at all?

08:27.110 --> 08:29.110
Maybe along the z-axis,

08:29.110 --> 08:32.380
but x and y are looking pretty sad.

08:32.750 --> 08:35.100
Okay, come on. We are not old boring people.

08:35.100 --> 08:36.880
We can do better than this.

08:36.880 --> 08:37.550
Uh, th-that's true.

08:37.550 --> 08:39.760
How late did we stay up last night?

08:39.760 --> 08:42.160
Almost 1:00 a.M.

08:42.610 --> 08:45.730
Damn straight, almost 1:00 a.M.

08:46.790 --> 08:48.410
And we weren't even watching TV.

08:48.410 --> 08:51.650
We were watching Netflix, like the kids do.

08:51.960 --> 08:53.800
Yeah, is it a comedy? Is it a drama?

08:53.800 --> 08:55.640
Nobody knows.

08:57.090 --> 08:58.730
Now, come on. We are gonna do this.

08:58.730 --> 08:59.430
Yeah. You get the paint,

08:59.430 --> 09:00.850
I'll rest for 30-40 minutes,

09:00.850 --> 09:03.100
and then we do this!

09:05.000 --> 09:06.720
I can't believe you almost had me bring

09:06.720 --> 09:09.360
a wild animal into my home.

09:10.140 --> 09:12.890
No one told you to poke the turtle's face.

09:13.670 --> 09:16.660
I was playing "Got Your Nose."

09:17.580 --> 09:20.440
That's how you get children to like you.

09:21.620 --> 09:23.320
I'm surprised you even care if he likes you,

09:23.320 --> 09:26.310
since you're planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get.

09:26.310 --> 09:27.330
Ugh, this again.

09:27.330 --> 09:30.940
Amy, I've already had one new hole torn in my body today.

09:30.940 --> 09:32.640
I don't need another one.

09:33.710 --> 09:35.740
Sheldon, I know the odds of you

09:35.740 --> 09:37.860
even going to Mars are incredibly small,

09:37.860 --> 09:40.980
but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something

09:40.980 --> 09:44.070
that would take you away from me forever.

09:44.070 --> 09:45.840
So you're saying you wouldn't leave me

09:45.840 --> 09:47.720
for the chance to be one of the first humans

09:47.720 --> 09:49.720
to colonize another planet?

09:49.720 --> 09:51.380
I would at least mention it

09:51.380 --> 09:53.590
before filling out the application.

09:54.190 --> 09:56.500
Huh, that's exactly what Leonard, Wolowitz, Koothrappali,

09:56.500 --> 09:59.040
Bernadette and Penny said.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.420
And who says you could even survive

10:01.420 --> 10:03.050
an interplanetary mission, anyway?

10:03.050 --> 10:05.470
You could barely survive a tiny turtle bite.

10:05.860 --> 10:07.570
First of all, this...

10:07.570 --> 10:09.740
has only made me stronger.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.100
But beyond that, all I did

10:12.100 --> 10:14.270
was fill out an application.

10:14.490 --> 10:15.630
You know what?

10:15.840 --> 10:18.150
Go to Mars, Sheldon.

10:21.010 --> 10:23.390
Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?

10:23.390 --> 10:25.000
No. Forget it.

10:25.690 --> 10:28.290
What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?

10:28.290 --> 10:29.880
Please don't.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.230
Yep, you're mad.

10:44.950 --> 10:47.110
Okay, let me see the damage.

10:47.110 --> 10:48.370
Hang on.

10:49.430 --> 10:51.200
Well, I think you broke the dowels.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.580
You're not gonna have time to glue it back on--

10:52.580 --> 10:54.020
you'll have to nail it.

10:54.020 --> 10:54.910
With what?

10:54.940 --> 10:58.180
Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?

10:58.180 --> 10:59.360
She does.

10:59.360 --> 11:00.080
Great.

11:00.080 --> 11:03.210
Neither of those. Try a hammer!

11:05.630 --> 11:06.750
Did that feel good?

11:06.750 --> 11:09.160
You feel like a big man now?

11:12.130 --> 11:14.840
I was going to make you red zinger,

11:14.840 --> 11:17.450
but since Mars is the red planet,

11:17.450 --> 11:19.950
I went with peppermint.

11:22.560 --> 11:24.850
Why do you even want to do this?

11:25.700 --> 11:27.310
Actually...

11:27.760 --> 11:29.480
as part of the application,

11:29.480 --> 11:32.510
I was required to make a short video

11:32.510 --> 11:35.200
answering that very question.

11:35.200 --> 11:36.230
You want to see it?

11:36.230 --> 11:37.910
Can't you just tell me?

11:37.910 --> 11:39.960
But I made a video.

11:42.710 --> 11:44.470
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

11:44.470 --> 11:47.430
and I'd like to tell you why I should be chosen to...

11:49.040 --> 11:51.490
go to Mars!

11:52.710 --> 11:54.150
I'm exceedingly smart.

11:54.150 --> 11:56.210
I graduated college at 14.

11:56.210 --> 11:58.190
While my brother was getting an STD

11:58.190 --> 12:00.940
I was getting a PhD.

12:02.970 --> 12:06.130
Penicillin can't take this away.

12:06.500 --> 12:10.220
Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important

12:10.220 --> 12:13.390
and... my hygiene is impeccable.

12:13.390 --> 12:15.600
In fact, animals don't trust me

12:15.600 --> 12:17.750
because I smell like nothing.

12:17.750 --> 12:18.720
Yeah...

12:19.670 --> 12:22.200
Literally nothing.

12:24.280 --> 12:26.030
During the seven-month space flight,

12:26.030 --> 12:29.810
I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humor.

12:32.320 --> 12:33.380
Hey, Leonard...

12:33.380 --> 12:36.700
is there any peanut brittle left in that can?

12:36.700 --> 12:39.610
You mean this weirdly suspicious one?

12:39.610 --> 12:42.340
Yes. Open it and check.

12:47.780 --> 12:48.900
I don't get it.

12:48.900 --> 12:50.330
There's actually peanut brittle in...

12:57.550 --> 13:00.120
Please go to Mars.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.210
But on a more serious note:

13:03.210 --> 13:05.700
The most important reason I want to go to Mars is that

13:05.700 --> 13:08.460
I believe, as a scientist,

13:08.460 --> 13:13.100
it's my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward.

13:13.100 --> 13:16.290
Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult.

13:16.290 --> 13:19.050
But life here on Earth is no picnic.

13:19.050 --> 13:22.120
Also, picnics are no picnic.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.160
Where should we go for lunch?

13:24.160 --> 13:26.650
Oh, I know, the ground.

13:27.650 --> 13:28.670
In conclusion,

13:28.670 --> 13:30.300
thank you for considering me

13:30.300 --> 13:32.750
for this journey of a lifetime.

13:34.700 --> 13:37.060
To Mars!

13:39.390 --> 13:41.630
Afterwards, Leonard blew his nose,

13:41.630 --> 13:44.170
and pie came out.

13:47.770 --> 13:49.960
Right there, right there,

13:49.960 --> 13:51.780
Oh, God, that's it!

13:54.670 --> 13:56.660
How did you get paint in your eye?

13:56.660 --> 13:59.660
Because you wouldn't let me wear safety goggles!

14:04.600 --> 14:05.820
This looks terrible.

14:05.820 --> 14:07.030
She-she's gonna know.

14:07.030 --> 14:07.840
It's fine.

14:07.840 --> 14:09.600
You just need two more nails.

14:09.600 --> 14:10.540
Okay, where should I put them?

14:10.540 --> 14:12.730
In Emily's eyes.

14:14.700 --> 14:16.570
You're not helping.

14:16.570 --> 14:18.670
Well, maybe this is what you get for snooping.

14:18.670 --> 14:20.750
You know, it-it's bad enough that I have to deal with this...

14:20.750 --> 14:22.470
Raj? I'm back.

14:22.470 --> 14:24.420
Oh, no.

14:26.740 --> 14:30.080
How was the hospital?

14:30.080 --> 14:31.610
Fine.

14:31.610 --> 14:33.570
What were you doing in there?

14:34.320 --> 14:37.190
Uh... w-well...

14:37.570 --> 14:39.140
Okay, look, I-I don't want to lie to you.

14:39.140 --> 14:41.620
I-I got curious, I was looking around...

14:41.620 --> 14:44.580
and I broke the drawer on your night stand.

14:44.580 --> 14:46.500
You were looking in my night stand?

14:46.500 --> 14:47.600
Yeah.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.480
So, the first time I leave you alone,

14:49.480 --> 14:51.320
you snoop on me?

14:52.080 --> 14:54.080
You've never snooped around my apartment?

14:54.080 --> 14:55.390
No!

14:55.710 --> 14:57.110
Come on, think back.

14:57.110 --> 14:59.480
It would really help if you had!

15:00.880 --> 15:02.130
I can't believe you don't trust me!

15:02.130 --> 15:03.980
She sounds really mad.

15:05.710 --> 15:06.910
We should hang up.

15:06.910 --> 15:08.970
Yeah, we should.

15:08.970 --> 15:10.480
But we're not going to, are we?

15:10.480 --> 15:12.610
Not a chance.

15:13.190 --> 15:15.710
What happened to "snooping is wrong"?

15:15.710 --> 15:17.510
Howard, you're going to jail for tax fraud.

15:17.510 --> 15:19.030
Who cares?

15:21.810 --> 15:23.220
Well, we did it.

15:24.270 --> 15:25.890
We sure did.

15:25.890 --> 15:27.780
I mean, I was on fire!

15:27.780 --> 15:30.250
I-I was in the zone, like an athlete.

15:30.250 --> 15:33.100
Sweetie, I beat you at this, too.

15:33.750 --> 15:35.120
So, where do we want to hang it?

15:35.120 --> 15:36.270
What? Are you kidding?

15:36.270 --> 15:37.670
We're not hanging it!

15:37.670 --> 15:39.580
But it's an expression of our love.

15:39.580 --> 15:42.760
And our butts! Not hanging it!

15:43.510 --> 15:45.910
Seems a shame to throw it away.

15:45.910 --> 15:47.160
Yeah.

15:48.610 --> 15:49.510
We could give it to Sheldon,

15:49.510 --> 15:51.990
and tell him William Shatner painted it.

15:54.820 --> 15:57.540
God, I love you. I love you so much.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.200
I think I'm gonna go home.

16:03.390 --> 16:05.100
Why?

16:05.800 --> 16:08.630
I really don't understand what's happening here.

16:08.630 --> 16:11.400
You know, Sheldon, at any other time,

16:11.400 --> 16:13.630
learning that you had plans to go live on Mars

16:13.630 --> 16:15.740
would be a slow news day.

16:15.740 --> 16:17.220
But a couple of hours ago,

16:17.220 --> 16:19.170
we were getting a turtle.

16:19.610 --> 16:21.660
And silly as it sounds,

16:22.290 --> 16:24.500
I thought that meant something.

16:25.700 --> 16:27.260
Amy!

16:28.350 --> 16:31.110
Oh, why didn't I give her Sleepy Time tea?

16:33.360 --> 16:34.760
Amy, wait!

16:34.760 --> 16:37.800
Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me, too.

16:37.800 --> 16:38.680
Sure.

16:38.680 --> 16:41.120
Unless something better comes along.

16:41.660 --> 16:45.150
Do you want me to withdraw my application?

16:45.650 --> 16:47.260
What I want is for us

16:47.260 --> 16:50.560
to be planning our future together.

16:51.840 --> 16:54.630
And in that future,

16:54.630 --> 16:57.400
are we on the same planet?

16:57.400 --> 17:00.570
Yeah, because I've seen people make the long-distance thing work.

17:00.570 --> 17:01.770
We're on the same planet!

17:01.770 --> 17:02.770
Okay!

17:06.480 --> 17:09.310
Does that planet have to be Earth?

17:10.260 --> 17:12.480
Are you asking me to go to Mars with you?

17:12.480 --> 17:14.150
I am.

17:14.460 --> 17:18.040
Yeah, if I'm going to a barren, lifeless environment,

17:18.040 --> 17:22.330
where the chances of survival are slim to none,

17:22.330 --> 17:24.900
I want you there with me.

17:29.070 --> 17:30.440
Why don't we go back to the apartment,

17:30.440 --> 17:32.520
and fill out your application?

17:33.410 --> 17:35.230
Okay.

17:36.510 --> 17:38.660
I suppose being the first people

17:38.660 --> 17:41.240
on a new planet would be incredibly exciting.

17:41.240 --> 17:42.890
Oh, I know.

17:42.890 --> 17:46.460
We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars.

17:46.460 --> 17:50.040
We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! On Mars.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.170
We could be the first to say

17:52.170 --> 17:56.120
"Good Lord, what on Mars are you talking about?"

17:56.840 --> 17:57.690
You know,

17:58.320 --> 18:00.110
we could also be the first people

18:00.110 --> 18:02.390
to procreate on Mars.

18:03.870 --> 18:07.010
You just can't keep it in your space pants, can you?

18:09.050 --> 18:09.980
Think about it.

18:09.980 --> 18:11.150
If we had a family there,

18:11.150 --> 18:13.330
our kids would be Martians.

18:15.470 --> 18:17.840
They would, wouldn't they?

18:19.150 --> 18:21.680
We could give them cool Martian names.

18:21.680 --> 18:24.070
And we could teach them about Martian history.

18:24.070 --> 18:26.070
Like, who planted those flags?

18:26.070 --> 18:29.330
And, uh, where did that copy of Mars Attacks! Come from?

18:30.620 --> 18:34.010
I guess we'll have to make a new video together, as a couple.

18:34.010 --> 18:35.860
Good idea.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.670
And since you've had such a rough day,

18:39.670 --> 18:42.700
I'm gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard's face.

18:49.320 --> 18:50.830
Thank you for forgiving me.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.340
It's okay.

18:52.340 --> 18:55.270
At some point, we were bound to have our first fight.

18:55.270 --> 18:57.030
Well, it almost happened when you called

18:57.030 --> 19:00.080
my apple pie crust "Doughy."

19:02.000 --> 19:03.030
The truth is you were right.

19:03.030 --> 19:05.610
And I was just angry at myself.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.750
Can I ask you one thing?

19:08.750 --> 19:10.470
Of course. What?

19:10.850 --> 19:13.860
Did you look in my closet?

19:13.860 --> 19:15.100
No. Just the drawer.

19:15.100 --> 19:16.970
You promise you didn't look in the closet?

19:16.970 --> 19:18.460
I promise.

19:18.460 --> 19:19.480
Why, what's in there?

19:19.480 --> 19:20.880
Don't worry about it.

19:22.020 --> 19:23.340
Good night.
