00:03.650 --> 00:05.400
Leonard, what time does your mom's plane get in?

00:05.400 --> 00:07.360
I don't know-- some time tomorrow morning.

00:07.360 --> 00:08.710
Don't you want to know for sure?

00:08.710 --> 00:09.610
No need to.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.710
As soon as she flies into California airspace,

00:11.710 --> 00:14.440
I'll feel a disturbance in the Force.

00:14.930 --> 00:17.250
It's so nice both of your moms are coming in

00:17.250 --> 00:19.260
to see you guys get an award.

00:19.610 --> 00:22.280
Well, my mother's been there for every honor I've won

00:22.280 --> 00:23.770
since I beat out my twin sister

00:23.770 --> 00:26.880
for the "Did it on the potty" trophy.

00:27.340 --> 00:28.460
How does this look?

00:28.460 --> 00:30.590
Aw, it's so nice. She's gonna love it.

00:30.590 --> 00:32.610
Sure, his mom gets roses.

00:32.610 --> 00:33.500
When I want them,

00:33.500 --> 00:37.340
they're a "bouquet of severed plant genitals."

00:37.910 --> 00:38.700
You act like I didn't get you

00:38.700 --> 00:41.710
that mushroom log on Valentine's Day.

00:42.140 --> 00:42.770
He's right.

00:42.770 --> 00:46.370
Roses die, but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms

00:46.370 --> 00:49.650
for two or three magical years.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.750
You know, your mom's never been too thrilled with our relationship.

00:51.750 --> 00:54.180
Maybe I should get her something so she warms up to me.

00:54.180 --> 00:55.850
If you could run out and get a PhD,

00:55.850 --> 00:57.870
that might make her like you.

00:58.280 --> 01:00.280
Really? It didn't work for you.

01:01.390 --> 01:03.330
Do you think the moms will get along?

01:03.330 --> 01:04.890
Uh, I don't know. They're pretty different.

01:04.890 --> 01:06.500
Maybe they'll be best friends.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.770
One of them is brilliant, one is sweet and simple.

01:09.770 --> 01:12.100
Sound familiar?

01:38.440 --> 01:42.060
Shelly, I'm so proud of you and Leonard for getting this award.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.180
Oh, thank you, Mother.

01:43.180 --> 01:45.290
I tried to read your paper, but it was very hard

01:45.290 --> 01:46.890
for me to understand.

01:46.890 --> 01:48.900
Oh, it's quite straightforward, actually.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.460
It describes a new model of the universe

01:51.460 --> 01:53.670
that conceptualizes it as the surface

01:53.670 --> 01:55.490
of an n-dimensional superfluid.

01:55.490 --> 01:56.450
Interesting.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.580
You can believe that,

01:57.580 --> 02:03.320
but God filling an ark with animals two-by-two is nonsense.

02:04.270 --> 02:07.680
What did they feed the lions, Mother?

02:08.380 --> 02:12.680
The floating bodies of drowned sinners, of course.

02:15.380 --> 02:19.320
Listen, Leonard's mom is a renowned psychiatrist

02:19.320 --> 02:20.690
and woman of science.

02:20.690 --> 02:23.570
Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself

02:23.570 --> 02:25.220
while she's here?

02:25.220 --> 02:27.150
Are you ashamed of me?

02:27.150 --> 02:29.770
Of course not. I love you.

02:29.770 --> 02:35.810
I'm just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say.

02:37.640 --> 02:40.510
Well, I love you, too.

02:40.820 --> 02:44.230
My little bowl of lion chow.

02:46.680 --> 02:48.890
So, have you and Penny set a wedding date?

02:48.890 --> 02:51.160
No, we're kind of taking it slow.

02:51.560 --> 02:53.010
I see.

02:56.420 --> 02:57.810
What does that mean?

02:57.810 --> 03:00.640
You've been on and off with this woman for seven years

03:00.640 --> 03:02.410
and engaged for one year.

03:02.410 --> 03:04.760
One has to wonder if there's a problem.

03:05.050 --> 03:08.170
Are you having satisfactory intercourse?

03:10.290 --> 03:12.310
Yes, Mother.

03:13.820 --> 03:17.020
Only satisfactory. I see.

03:18.920 --> 03:20.420
I change my answer.

03:20.420 --> 03:22.680
It-it's amazing. It's hot.

03:22.680 --> 03:25.490
We can barely keep our hands off each other.

03:26.220 --> 03:28.390
Seems odd to try and impress your mother

03:28.390 --> 03:31.100
with your sexual prowess.

03:31.690 --> 03:35.530
But then, you always did have that unresolved Oedipal complex.

03:36.280 --> 03:38.550
See, this right here, what you're doing,

03:38.550 --> 03:41.000
can you please not do that around Sheldon's mom?

03:41.000 --> 03:43.740
Why? Are you attracted to her, too?

03:44.420 --> 03:45.750
Of course not.

03:45.750 --> 03:49.010
She's-she's just a very sweet and God-fearing lady,

03:49.010 --> 03:51.020
and you have to be respectful of her beliefs.

03:51.020 --> 03:52.370
Leonard, I'm an adult.

03:52.370 --> 03:54.680
I know how to conduct myself around people

03:54.680 --> 03:56.620
from different walks of life.

03:56.620 --> 03:57.540
Thank you.

03:57.540 --> 03:58.520
Where is she from again?

03:58.520 --> 03:59.410
East Texas.

04:04.290 --> 04:06.720
Hey, look who's here.

04:06.720 --> 04:09.960
Oh, Dr. Hofstadter, it's so good to see you again.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.120
Likewise.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.580
I read your paper; it was very impressive.

04:13.580 --> 04:14.890
Oh, thank you.

04:14.890 --> 04:16.840
We just spent two hours in traffic.

04:16.840 --> 04:19.920
Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper?

04:19.920 --> 04:22.240
Of course I did, but it's a mother's job

04:22.240 --> 04:24.210
to make sure her child's self-esteem

04:24.210 --> 04:27.770
is not dependent on anyone's approval.

04:28.420 --> 04:31.550
That's so sweet, you think I have self-esteem.

04:32.540 --> 04:35.220
Dr. Hofstadter, I want you to meet my mother, Mary.

04:35.220 --> 04:36.070
So nice to meet you.

04:36.070 --> 04:38.220
Nice to meet you, too. How was your flight?

04:38.220 --> 04:39.560
Very pleasant. And yours?

04:39.560 --> 04:41.590
Lovely. Almost as if someone--

04:41.590 --> 04:45.700
not saying who-- was watching over the plane.

04:47.070 --> 04:48.940
You're kidding, right?

04:50.310 --> 04:52.930
Subtle, Mom, real subtle.

04:59.550 --> 05:00.730
Stuart.

05:01.300 --> 05:02.610
Morning.

05:04.080 --> 05:05.570
We talked about this.

05:05.570 --> 05:06.790
I don't mind you still living here,

05:06.790 --> 05:08.360
but we got to have some rules.

05:08.360 --> 05:11.390
And rule number one is pants.

05:19.240 --> 05:21.180
You must be very proud of your son.

05:21.180 --> 05:22.570
Oh, yes.

05:22.570 --> 05:26.350
He recently argued a case before the Supreme Court.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.960
He did?

05:30.670 --> 05:33.130
Oh, you mean this son.

05:34.510 --> 05:36.980
Uh, sure, he's terrific.

05:37.450 --> 05:40.590
Uh, Beverly, would you like to see the math I worked out

05:40.590 --> 05:41.920
to support our hypothesis?

05:41.920 --> 05:43.350
Uh, you mean, my hypothesis.

05:43.350 --> 05:45.170
I hypothesized it all by myself.

05:45.170 --> 05:47.120
Calm down, dear.

05:47.540 --> 05:48.480
Mary, I'm curious.

05:48.480 --> 05:49.920
When did you first realize

05:49.920 --> 05:52.270
that your son had such a remarkable mind?

05:52.270 --> 05:54.250
Ooh, good question.

05:54.250 --> 05:58.370
Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.

05:58.790 --> 06:00.740
Well, I would have to say when he was 13

06:00.740 --> 06:03.780
and tried to build a nuclear reactor in the tool shed.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.500
Ooh, this is a good one.

06:07.130 --> 06:08.980
Now, the first thing you have to know about Shelly is

06:08.980 --> 06:10.310
ever since he was a little boy,

06:10.310 --> 06:14.690
he was always concerned with the well-being of others.

06:17.030 --> 06:19.050
And he didn't think that it was fair

06:19.050 --> 06:20.840
for people to pay for electricity,

06:20.840 --> 06:24.240
so he was gonna power the entire town for free.

06:24.240 --> 06:25.660
Tell her about the uranium!

06:25.660 --> 06:26.890
Tell her about the uranium.

06:26.890 --> 06:27.810
Oh, well!

06:27.810 --> 06:29.740
Oh, this is adorable.

06:29.740 --> 06:33.510
When he arranged to get some yellowcake from Chad,

06:33.510 --> 06:35.500
I thought he was talking about Twinkies

06:35.500 --> 06:37.860
from one of his friends.

06:38.530 --> 06:39.790
But I wasn't.

06:39.790 --> 06:42.330
'Cause I didn't have any friends.

06:43.390 --> 06:44.690
No.

06:45.110 --> 06:47.390
It turns out that this little scallywag was trying

06:47.390 --> 06:50.030
to use my Visa card to buy uranium

06:50.030 --> 06:55.400
from an African warlord in the country of Chad!

06:56.430 --> 06:58.320
Sounds like Sheldon was a handful.

06:58.320 --> 07:00.130
Oh, he was a handful.

07:00.130 --> 07:02.250
I was a handful.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.030
You still are.

07:09.100 --> 07:11.440
Uh, Mom, hey, tell Mary the story

07:11.440 --> 07:14.190
about how I made a Van de Graaff generator

07:14.190 --> 07:16.230
out of our vacuum cleaner.

07:16.230 --> 07:17.600
All right.

07:17.940 --> 07:20.380
He broke the vacuum cleaner.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.950
I mean, for a while, everything was vampires.

07:28.950 --> 07:30.510
Now it's all zombies.

07:30.510 --> 07:32.960
I wonder what the next monster fad will be.

07:32.960 --> 07:35.630
We haven't had a good invisible man in a while.

07:35.630 --> 07:39.370
Clearly, you've never seen me try to talk to a woman.

07:40.860 --> 07:41.940
Guys.

07:41.940 --> 07:43.990
In the time you've been sitting here playing video games,

07:43.990 --> 07:46.180
I got the car washed, picked up cleaning supplies

07:46.180 --> 07:47.730
and went to the bank.

07:47.730 --> 07:49.680
I put on pants.

07:51.570 --> 07:53.670
Kiss-ass.

07:55.690 --> 07:56.970
Okay, I don't know when I became

07:56.970 --> 07:58.610
the mother to three lazy teenagers,

07:58.610 --> 07:59.700
but it stops today.

07:59.700 --> 08:02.320
You guys are cleaning the kitchen, top to bottom.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.910
Hey, I don't even live here.

08:05.900 --> 08:09.030
Yes or no, do you have clothes in my laundry right now?

08:09.030 --> 08:11.410
I do.

08:11.410 --> 08:12.890
And some of it's wool,

08:12.890 --> 08:15.310
so dry flat if possible.

08:17.790 --> 08:22.200
Oh, and here's a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.930
You don't look very happy.

08:23.930 --> 08:27.040
Well, I had just begun puberty.

08:28.310 --> 08:30.350
It was figuratively and literally

08:30.350 --> 08:34.020
one of the hairiest moments of my life.

08:34.020 --> 08:36.360
Shelly does not like change.

08:36.360 --> 08:37.300
Oh, true.

08:37.300 --> 08:39.530
But all the clenching in the world will not keep

08:39.530 --> 08:42.290
testicles in your abdomen.

08:43.890 --> 08:45.960
Hey, sorry, got caught up at work.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.730
- Hi, Beverly! - Hello.

08:47.950 --> 08:49.880
Oh, okay.

08:50.770 --> 08:52.150
Sorry, I forgot.

08:52.150 --> 08:53.370
You remember my mother.

08:53.370 --> 08:54.710
Oh, yes. Hi, Mary!

08:54.710 --> 08:56.720
Good to see you again, dear.

08:56.720 --> 08:59.380
Ah, yeah, now that's what I'm talking about.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.770
So, Mom, you haven't seen Penny since we got engaged.

09:02.770 --> 09:04.630
Oh, yeah, let me show you the ring.

09:04.630 --> 09:06.010
Oh, lovely.

09:06.010 --> 09:07.790
Must have been very expensive.

09:07.790 --> 09:08.950
Oh, no, not at all.

09:08.950 --> 09:11.240
No, we, uh, found a place online

09:11.240 --> 09:15.160
that, uh, repurposes diamond drill bits.

09:16.540 --> 09:18.710
We did not. That's not true.

09:19.340 --> 09:21.660
Can I speak to you alone for a second?

09:21.660 --> 09:22.850
Oh, sure.

09:23.240 --> 09:24.760
It came from Tiffany's.

09:25.460 --> 09:26.580
You mean the box, right?

09:26.580 --> 09:28.190
Keep walking!

09:30.960 --> 09:34.370
Really doesn't matter to me how much he spent on the ring.

09:34.760 --> 09:36.620
I think.

09:37.530 --> 09:39.380
Did I misspeak about the ring?

09:39.380 --> 09:41.830
Yes, and we'll get back to that.

09:41.830 --> 09:43.660
But, uh, even with your mother here,

09:43.660 --> 09:46.540
you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom.

09:46.540 --> 09:48.580
You're like one of those elephant seal pups

09:48.580 --> 09:51.360
that steals the milk from two mothers!

09:52.260 --> 09:54.200
Do you mean what marine biologists

09:54.200 --> 09:56.220
refer to as "super weaning"?

09:56.220 --> 09:59.310
Yes, you are a super weaner!

10:02.350 --> 10:04.530
Well, now I have to correct you.

10:04.530 --> 10:07.640
A-As a bit of an elephant seal buff,

10:07.640 --> 10:09.430
the more accurate comparison

10:09.430 --> 10:11.220
would be when two mother seals

10:11.220 --> 10:13.360
actively seek to nourish the same pup.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.750
So I believe the term you're looking for

10:15.750 --> 10:18.440
is a double mother suckler.

10:20.550 --> 10:21.370
Yeah, you're right.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.050
That is the term I'm looking for.

10:23.050 --> 10:26.520
You are a dirty double mother suckler!

10:28.760 --> 10:31.720
Okay, well, now that we have the terminology straightened out.

10:31.720 --> 10:34.210
How dare you!

10:35.390 --> 10:36.600
We're not in a rush.

10:36.600 --> 10:38.150
We'll set a date when the time is right.

10:38.150 --> 10:39.610
It doesn't matter, sweetie.

10:39.610 --> 10:41.230
The moment a man lays with a woman,

10:41.230 --> 10:43.770
they are married in the eyes of the Lord.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.430
The bible is "uch" to you?

10:54.430 --> 10:56.310
No, I'm sorry. That was inappropriate.

10:56.310 --> 10:57.700
As a psychiatrist,

10:57.700 --> 11:02.370
I know how important people's superstitions can be to them.

11:03.870 --> 11:05.900
You want to talk about superstitions?

11:05.900 --> 11:07.820
Sheldon sent me the books you wrote--

11:07.820 --> 11:10.430
all that nonsense about superegos and ids.

11:10.430 --> 11:14.170
What bull dropped that on the barn floor?

11:14.270 --> 11:16.550
His name is Sigmund Freud.

11:16.550 --> 11:17.730
Hey, look at that!

11:17.730 --> 11:20.970
You both believe in Jewish bearded guys.

11:22.330 --> 11:24.100
Stay out of this.

11:25.370 --> 11:27.570
At least the bearded man that I believe in

11:27.570 --> 11:29.380
preaches love and compassion.

11:29.380 --> 11:30.950
All yours talks about is

11:30.950 --> 11:32.430
why you hold in your poop

11:32.430 --> 11:35.700
and want to crawl back inside your mama.

11:38.130 --> 11:39.710
It's fascinating.

11:39.710 --> 11:41.940
How can someone as enlightened as Sheldon

11:41.940 --> 11:44.670
come from someone like you?

11:45.710 --> 11:46.850
I know the answer.

11:46.850 --> 11:48.850
You're not gonna like it.

11:49.470 --> 11:50.340
Try me.

11:50.340 --> 11:53.400
When I was pregnant with Shelly, I was driving to church,

11:53.400 --> 11:54.910
and I was praying to the Lord

11:54.910 --> 11:58.760
to give me a son smarter than his dumb-ass daddy.

11:59.140 --> 12:02.780
And I looked over and I saw a Jesus bobblehead

12:02.780 --> 12:07.160
in the Subaru next to me nodding yes.

12:13.010 --> 12:14.430
What is that supposed to mean?

12:14.430 --> 12:15.430
It means...

12:15.430 --> 12:18.500
I can't believe we're having this conversation.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.000
Well, do it some more.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.440
Maybe you can knock some sense into yourself.

12:23.440 --> 12:25.660
I hope we all stops hitting ourselves

12:25.660 --> 12:27.200
and talk about something safe, you know,

12:27.200 --> 12:30.900
like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are.

12:30.900 --> 12:33.360
Maybe it is not my fault that your mother likes me

12:33.360 --> 12:34.580
better than she likes you!

12:34.580 --> 12:35.360
Oh, don't flatter yourself!

12:35.360 --> 12:38.230
She likes everybody better than she likes me!

12:44.890 --> 12:46.580
How old is this Jell-O?

12:46.580 --> 12:50.630
Well, it's carrots, so gonna say very.

12:52.240 --> 12:54.580
Sorry we have to do this.

12:54.580 --> 12:55.860
Bernadette's not wrong.

12:55.860 --> 12:57.580
She does work hard around here.

12:57.580 --> 12:58.620
Yeah, maybe it's a good thing

12:58.620 --> 13:00.560
if she stops babying you so much.

13:00.560 --> 13:02.470
She doesn't baby me.

13:02.470 --> 13:05.550
I saw her pull you home in a wagon.

13:06.620 --> 13:07.420
For your information,

13:07.420 --> 13:10.550
I twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck.

13:11.280 --> 13:12.590
Face it, dude,

13:12.590 --> 13:14.980
Bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to,

13:14.980 --> 13:18.180
and that was not a healthy relationship.

13:19.770 --> 13:20.940
You're right.

13:21.510 --> 13:23.050
It's time for me

13:23.050 --> 13:26.570
to act like an adult in this marriage.

13:26.570 --> 13:31.800
Starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash.

13:37.090 --> 13:39.340
Bernie, I made a mess!

13:42.810 --> 13:45.750
I'm terribly sorry that I upset your mother.

13:45.750 --> 13:48.290
Oh, it's all right. She'll forgive you.

13:48.290 --> 13:51.460
She has to or she goes to hell.

13:53.980 --> 13:55.530
I can't help but notice

13:55.530 --> 13:58.230
how her unconditional love for you

13:58.230 --> 14:02.180
is diametrically opposed to my own parenting strategies.

14:02.180 --> 14:05.000
Well, you doled out affection

14:05.000 --> 14:07.600
as a reward for achievement--

14:07.600 --> 14:09.570
a proven way to raise a child.

14:09.570 --> 14:12.460
Or train a rat.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.770
But look how well you turned out.

14:14.770 --> 14:18.510
I'd feign modesty at this point, but who would believe me?

14:18.510 --> 14:20.610
Still, you need to consider

14:20.610 --> 14:23.490
how successful Leonard's brother and sister are.

14:23.490 --> 14:24.500
I suppose.

14:24.500 --> 14:28.370
While my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots.

14:29.450 --> 14:31.830
Do you suppose you would've flourished more

14:31.830 --> 14:34.390
in a reward-based environment?

14:34.690 --> 14:36.010
Perhaps.

14:36.010 --> 14:37.390
But my mom made me spaghetti

14:37.390 --> 14:39.820
with chopped-up hot dogs whenever I wanted,

14:39.820 --> 14:42.160
so who cares?

14:44.080 --> 14:46.500
Not once did my mother ever give me any love

14:46.500 --> 14:48.830
or affection for just being myself;

14:48.830 --> 14:50.060
I always had to earn it.

14:50.060 --> 14:53.260
Oh, Leonard, I'm sure she loves you very much.

14:53.260 --> 14:57.090
In her own cold godless way.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.930
Yeah, and you certainly don't have to earn my love.

15:00.930 --> 15:01.800
Thank you.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.020
Of course, you already knew that

15:03.020 --> 15:06.610
when you bought me this princess-cut drill bit.

15:07.390 --> 15:08.610
That's not what it is.

15:08.610 --> 15:10.970
I know, I know.

15:14.190 --> 15:15.830
When your mom gets back, I'm gonna need

15:15.830 --> 15:17.960
to apologize for the way I spoke to her.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.960
Well, come on now, she did kind of start it.

15:19.960 --> 15:23.290
Doesn't matter; a good Christian would've turned the other cheek.

15:23.290 --> 15:23.990
On the other hand,

15:23.990 --> 15:26.490
a good Texan would've shot her, so...

15:28.950 --> 15:31.580
I just kind of split the difference.

15:32.730 --> 15:35.430
Hey, who's in the mood for spaghetti and hot dogs?

15:35.430 --> 15:36.310
Oh, me!

15:36.310 --> 15:37.110
Yeah, me, too!

15:37.110 --> 15:38.280
Coming up.

15:39.510 --> 15:42.160
I don't really feel I deserve it.

15:45.030 --> 15:46.340
That was a big sticky mess,

15:46.340 --> 15:48.120
but... I think I got it.

15:48.120 --> 15:49.210
Looks good.

15:50.570 --> 15:51.200
Look at that.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.260
You cleaned it up all by yourself.

15:53.590 --> 15:56.440
Yes, I cleaned it up all by myself.

15:56.440 --> 15:58.390
Honestly, I don't know why you complain so...

16:00.380 --> 16:02.280
Okay, maybe I missed one spot.

16:09.180 --> 16:11.180
Just leave.

16:13.060 --> 16:15.820
I'm so glad that you and I were able to bury the hatchet.

16:15.820 --> 16:16.650
Me, too.

16:16.650 --> 16:19.110
And I respect your right to your beliefs.

16:19.110 --> 16:21.310
And I will pray for you.

16:23.830 --> 16:25.610
Okay, Mom, let's get you back to your hotel

16:25.610 --> 16:27.490
before anyone says anything else.

16:27.490 --> 16:28.890
One moment.

16:28.890 --> 16:31.040
There's something I need to say to you.

16:31.040 --> 16:33.180
Oh, really? That's too bad.

16:33.990 --> 16:37.620
Leonard, I always made you earn my affection,

16:37.620 --> 16:39.570
but today I realize that

16:39.570 --> 16:42.160
there's more than one way to raise a child.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.280
I taught her that!

16:45.290 --> 16:46.360
Therefore, I would like

16:46.360 --> 16:50.040
to initiate a new protocol wherein I...

16:50.040 --> 16:53.580
shower you with unconditional love.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.950
When does that start?

16:58.590 --> 17:00.190
So needy.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.590
Come to Mommy.

17:08.650 --> 17:10.660
It's okay, go ahead.

17:18.070 --> 17:20.070
Oh, my son.

17:22.470 --> 17:24.480
Oh, my mother.

17:25.450 --> 17:27.430
Oh, my God.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.640
It's a hard-knock life

17:55.990 --> 17:59.240
It's the hard-knock life for us

17:59.240 --> 18:02.580
It's the hard-knock life for us

18:02.580 --> 18:05.670
'Stead of treated, we get tricked

18:05.670 --> 18:09.070
'Stead of kisses, we get kicked

18:09.070 --> 18:11.390
It's the hard-knock life

18:11.390 --> 18:14.900
Got no folks to speak of so

18:14.900 --> 18:18.100
It's the hard-knock row we hoe

18:18.100 --> 18:21.440
Cotton blankets... 'stead of wool

18:21.440 --> 18:24.330
Empty bellies... 'stead of full

18:24.330 --> 18:26.290
It's a hard-knock life.
