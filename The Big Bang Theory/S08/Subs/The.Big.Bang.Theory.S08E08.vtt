WEBVTT

00:04.640 --> 00:06.670
Oh, hey, we ran into your mom at Benihana last night.

00:06.670 --> 00:08.480
Uh, yeah, she loves that place.

00:08.480 --> 00:10.040
Every time they flip a shrimp in the air,

00:10.040 --> 00:12.900
she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it.

00:13.550 --> 00:15.670
That's why I don't take her to the Seaworld.

00:17.370 --> 00:18.700
I know you don't want to hear it,

00:18.700 --> 00:20.540
but she was there with Stuart.

00:20.730 --> 00:22.780
That's fine. I don't care.

00:22.780 --> 00:24.670
It doesn't bug you when they go out on dates?

00:24.670 --> 00:25.750
They're not dating.

00:25.750 --> 00:28.650
They're just two friends who went out to dinner.

00:28.650 --> 00:30.610
And then went back to the home they share

00:30.610 --> 00:31.720
where they probably fell asleep

00:31.720 --> 00:33.230
in the matching pajamas she got them

00:33.230 --> 00:36.190
because they both just love penguins.

00:37.450 --> 00:41.040
Hey, lots of people wear matching pajamas who aren't dating.

00:41.040 --> 00:42.150
Like who?

00:42.150 --> 00:44.170
Like you and your dog.

00:45.610 --> 00:48.830
Don't rule out the dating.

00:48.830 --> 00:51.440
Fine, it bothers me.

00:51.440 --> 00:52.460
You happy?

00:52.460 --> 00:54.520
You think you've got problems.

00:54.520 --> 00:57.420
The gibbon is the only member of the ape family

00:57.420 --> 01:00.330
not classified as a great ape.

01:02.230 --> 01:03.540
How is this helpful?

01:03.540 --> 01:05.590
All the non-human apes are classified

01:05.590 --> 01:07.560
as great apes except one.

01:07.560 --> 01:08.430
That means

01:08.430 --> 01:11.720
taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape

01:11.720 --> 01:13.570
just to single out the poor gibbon

01:13.570 --> 01:15.990
as the weird kid on the playground.

01:16.660 --> 01:19.940
Now there's a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.

01:20.680 --> 01:23.110
But the gibbon doesn't know what it's categorized as.

01:23.110 --> 01:25.260
It doesn't even know it's called a gibbon.

01:25.260 --> 01:26.520
True.

01:27.090 --> 01:29.920
Sorry, kid, you've got it worse than a gibbon.

01:59.060 --> 02:00.300
We brought snacks for movie night.

02:00.300 --> 02:01.100
Oh, great.

02:01.100 --> 02:03.670
I don't suppose you also brought napkins, clean bowls,

02:03.670 --> 02:05.690
utensils and a roll of toilet paper.

02:05.690 --> 02:06.430
Right here.

02:08.540 --> 02:10.090
You guys are the best.

02:10.090 --> 02:11.360
What's with the clothes?

02:11.360 --> 02:12.890
Well, with all the new stuff I bought for work,

02:12.890 --> 02:14.860
I needed to make room in my closet.

02:14.860 --> 02:16.260
I meant why are they folded?

02:16.260 --> 02:17.650
But whatever.

02:18.810 --> 02:21.310
Ooh, what's this?

02:21.310 --> 02:24.250
That, believe it or not, is my prom dress.

02:24.250 --> 02:26.260
Wow, you still have it?

02:26.260 --> 02:27.760
I just assumed it was balled up

02:27.760 --> 02:30.510
in the corner of a barn somewhere.

02:33.970 --> 02:36.200
What kind of teenager did you think I was?

02:36.200 --> 02:37.810
- Slutty. - Easy.

02:39.500 --> 02:42.030
The word is "popular."

02:43.500 --> 02:45.080
How was your prom? Did you go?

02:45.080 --> 02:46.910
No, but I was on clean-up crew.

02:46.910 --> 02:48.650
Aw, that's sad.

02:48.650 --> 02:49.980
No, it was okay.

02:49.980 --> 02:52.630
The DJ let me dance one slow song with my mop

02:52.630 --> 02:54.500
before he shut down.

02:55.700 --> 02:57.280
Whenever I see a bucket of dirty water,

02:57.280 --> 03:00.280
I still hear "Lady in Red."

03:03.190 --> 03:05.150
My prom was pretty terrible, too.

03:05.150 --> 03:06.580
I was so excited about my date,

03:06.580 --> 03:07.790
but it turned out he only asked me

03:07.790 --> 03:09.260
'cause he liked my friend.

03:09.260 --> 03:11.290
He spent the whole night talking about her.

03:11.290 --> 03:13.390
Okay, we get it, you had a friend and a date.

03:13.390 --> 03:15.040
Stop bragging.

03:16.200 --> 03:16.910
Doesn't matter.

03:16.910 --> 03:18.150
Prom is silly anyways.

03:18.150 --> 03:19.090
Easy for you to say;

03:19.090 --> 03:21.400
you probably went with the captain of the football team.

03:21.400 --> 03:23.000
No.

03:23.170 --> 03:24.400
I just made out with him a little

03:24.400 --> 03:26.320
while his date was puking.

03:27.370 --> 03:30.300
My date would've had to clean that up.

03:31.820 --> 03:33.190
Ooh, I have an idea.

03:33.190 --> 03:35.910
Maybe we can have, like, a prom do-over.

03:35.910 --> 03:37.900
Oh, that would be so much fun.

03:37.900 --> 03:40.850
We could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos.

03:40.850 --> 03:42.980
Ooh, and get our hair done, and slow-dance.

03:42.980 --> 03:43.920
Okay, guys, trust me,

03:43.920 --> 03:45.760
as someone who's been to, like, seven proms,

03:45.760 --> 03:48.070
it is never as good as you want it to be.

03:48.690 --> 03:50.440
You went to seven proms?

03:50.440 --> 03:51.530
Yeah, let's see.

03:51.530 --> 03:54.670
Uh, four "Under the Seas," Two "Enchanted Evenings,"

03:54.670 --> 03:56.330
and one "Night to Remember"

03:56.330 --> 03:59.190
that... I cannot remember for the life of me.

04:03.970 --> 04:05.070
Hey, where's Bernadette?

04:05.070 --> 04:07.710
She and Amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing.

04:07.710 --> 04:09.580
Oh, yeah, I got that Evite.

04:09.580 --> 04:10.950
Ever since I saw Pretty in Pink,

04:10.950 --> 04:13.260
I've wanted to go to an American prom.

04:14.160 --> 04:15.180
But then I saw Carrie,

04:15.180 --> 04:18.110
and I did not want to go to an American prom.

04:18.910 --> 04:19.930
But then I saw Never Been Kissed,

04:19.930 --> 04:22.070
and I'm back on the prom bandwagon.

04:23.030 --> 04:26.090
This prom thing's been a real roller coaster.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.160
Bernie's really excited.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.200
I-I could tell because her voice got so high,

04:30.200 --> 04:33.170
the beagle next door started howling.

04:35.130 --> 04:36.270
Did you go to your prom?

04:36.270 --> 04:37.360
No.

04:37.770 --> 04:41.160
I had a date with a proper education.

04:41.780 --> 04:45.760
Instead of a tuxedo, I dressed myself in good habits.

04:45.760 --> 04:47.090
Instead of spiked punch,

04:47.090 --> 04:50.380
I enjoyed the intoxicating flavor of knowledge.

04:50.380 --> 04:52.100
Instead of dancing in a gym,

04:52.100 --> 04:54.560
I shook my booty to the seductive rhythms...

04:54.560 --> 04:56.720
Okay, okay.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.880
...of AP Calculus.

05:01.630 --> 05:03.340
How come you're not shopping with Amy and Bernadette?

05:03.340 --> 05:05.890
Let me guess, you think the whole idea is lame?

05:05.890 --> 05:07.580
Well, who cares what I think? What do you think?

05:07.580 --> 05:09.350
Hmm, to be honest,

05:09.350 --> 05:12.480
it's kind of a dream come true to go to even a fake prom

05:12.480 --> 05:14.540
with a woman as beautiful as you.

05:14.540 --> 05:17.100
Ugh, thanks a lot.

05:17.980 --> 05:18.680
What?

05:18.680 --> 05:22.260
Well, now I can't blow this thing off without being a bitch.

05:22.870 --> 05:25.430
That sounds like a "Yes"!

05:28.380 --> 05:31.130
Ooh, every single person RSVP'd "Yes."

05:31.130 --> 05:32.880
This is so exciting!

05:32.880 --> 05:35.220
Isn't this exciting?

05:38.580 --> 05:39.730
Yep.

05:40.870 --> 05:42.600
Look, even Stuart's bringing a date.

05:42.600 --> 05:43.680
I wonder who it is.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.620
You know exactly who it is.

05:45.620 --> 05:46.730
He's gonna bring my mom.

05:46.730 --> 05:48.250
Why did you even invite him?

05:48.250 --> 05:51.140
Because he's our friend, and you two need to get along.

05:51.140 --> 05:52.390
And why can't he take your mom?

05:52.390 --> 05:54.740
You took her to your prom.

05:56.110 --> 05:59.020
I didn't "Take" her; she was a chaperone.

05:59.020 --> 06:02.050
I saw a picture of you two dancing together.

06:02.050 --> 06:03.200
W-What was I gonna do?

06:03.200 --> 06:05.450
They were playing our song!

06:07.250 --> 06:08.940
I can't take this anymore.

06:12.750 --> 06:13.630
Hello.

06:13.630 --> 06:15.210
Stuart, we have to talk.

06:15.210 --> 06:18.320
This thing with you and my mom,

06:18.320 --> 06:19.770
I-I hate it.

06:19.770 --> 06:21.200
It's making me crazy.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.840
You and I were friends for years,

06:23.840 --> 06:26.090
and now you're bringing my mother to a party

06:26.090 --> 06:27.440
I'm going to?!

06:27.440 --> 06:28.790
What the hell?!

06:28.790 --> 06:32.120
I'm not bringing your mother, I have a date.

06:32.120 --> 06:35.140
Oh, so now you're cheating on my mother?

06:38.790 --> 06:40.150
Wha-What are you talking about?

06:40.150 --> 06:43.330
There's nothing weird going on with me and your mother.

06:43.330 --> 06:47.080
Stewie, your bath is getting cold!

06:48.550 --> 06:50.260
I got to go, bye.

06:53.360 --> 06:54.020
Penny?

06:54.500 --> 06:55.300
Penny.

06:55.870 --> 06:56.610
Penny.

06:57.090 --> 06:57.910
Penny.

06:58.440 --> 06:59.530
Penny.

07:00.280 --> 07:01.520
You knocked more than usual.

07:01.520 --> 07:02.980
Next time I might be in a rush,

07:02.980 --> 07:05.060
it's good to have a few in the bank.

07:05.630 --> 07:06.620
Okay, what's up?

07:06.620 --> 07:08.730
I'd like to discuss this party

07:08.730 --> 07:10.910
that Amy and Bernadette are throwing.

07:10.910 --> 07:13.380
Since you and I are both reluctant to go,

07:13.380 --> 07:17.050
I think I've come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it.

07:17.050 --> 07:18.500
Great, how?

07:18.500 --> 07:20.870
We pretend we're aliens.

07:23.760 --> 07:25.720
I'm not the best at reading facial cues,

07:25.720 --> 07:29.780
but I'm gonna say that you love it and want to hear more.

07:30.040 --> 07:31.970
Now, in the beloved novel

07:31.970 --> 07:33.720
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,

07:33.720 --> 07:37.350
an alien named Ford Prefect pretended to be human

07:37.350 --> 07:38.600
in order to blend in

07:38.600 --> 07:40.690
so that he could write an entry about Earth

07:40.690 --> 07:42.630
for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,

07:42.630 --> 07:45.390
which is a travel book within the actual book,

07:45.390 --> 07:46.510
which is also called

07:46.510 --> 07:48.870
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

07:49.900 --> 07:52.050
Okay, just one question.

07:52.410 --> 07:53.610
What?

07:54.840 --> 07:57.570
My point is, pretending to be an alien is

07:57.570 --> 08:00.550
a valuable coping mechanism I've used many times.

08:00.550 --> 08:03.600
I did it the first time I went to see you in a play.

08:04.840 --> 08:07.290
You had no idea Commander Umfrumf

08:07.290 --> 08:09.880
of Ceti Alpha Three was in the audience.

08:10.650 --> 08:13.580
Oh, d-don't worry, he gave you seven thumbs up.

08:14.970 --> 08:16.200
Here's a question--

08:16.200 --> 08:18.670
as an alien pretending to be human,

08:18.670 --> 08:20.520
are you planning to engage in any

08:20.520 --> 08:24.780
post-prom mating rituals with Amy?

08:27.350 --> 08:30.450
There are post-prom mating rituals?

08:31.410 --> 08:32.250
Not always.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.600
Unless your date drives a van with an air mattress,

08:34.600 --> 08:36.030
then always.

08:37.980 --> 08:42.060
Well, if it's part of the prom experience, then I'm open to it.

08:42.060 --> 08:43.940
You're kidding.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.830
I may be an alien, but I have urges.

08:48.520 --> 08:52.110
If Amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space,

08:52.110 --> 08:53.820
well, then, I will happily catch them

08:53.820 --> 08:57.150
with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin.

09:01.010 --> 09:03.130
I'm not the best at reading facial cues,

09:03.130 --> 09:06.600
but I can see that you're a little turned on.

09:10.420 --> 09:12.100
You know, if you're not gonna learn how to do this,

09:12.100 --> 09:13.990
they make some pretty good clip-ons.

09:13.990 --> 09:17.190
Bruce Wayne doesn't wear a clip-on.

09:17.450 --> 09:20.720
Bruce Wayne doesn't make his roommate tie it for him.

09:22.180 --> 09:25.080
His name is Alfred, and, yes, he does.

09:27.270 --> 09:29.120
There, perfect.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.140
What, are you sure?

09:30.140 --> 09:32.870
It's my first prom, I want to do it correctly.

09:32.870 --> 09:34.760
I thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien.

09:34.760 --> 09:37.220
I was, but Penny didn't want to.

09:37.570 --> 09:39.030
You didn't want to.

09:39.030 --> 09:39.990
Bernadette, Amy,

09:39.990 --> 09:42.500
Koothrappali and Wolowitz didn't want to.

09:43.120 --> 09:46.070
And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody.

09:51.490 --> 09:53.120
Was that a flask?

09:53.340 --> 09:54.210
Yes.

09:54.230 --> 09:56.270
I've decided to embrace all of the traditions

09:56.270 --> 09:59.680
associated with prom, including spiking the punch.

10:01.750 --> 10:03.640
You're gonna put alcohol in the punch?

10:03.640 --> 10:05.810
Oh, no, this is pomegranate juice.

10:06.650 --> 10:08.730
It's all the fun of high school high jinks

10:08.730 --> 10:11.630
with the cell-protecting zip of antioxidants.

10:13.990 --> 10:15.640
If you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket,

10:15.640 --> 10:18.680
you'd be like the toughest kid on the Disney Channel.

10:20.980 --> 10:23.360
So, anything else planned for tonight?

10:23.360 --> 10:24.780
Oh, everything.

10:24.780 --> 10:27.630
Getting our picture taken, slow-dancing,

10:27.630 --> 10:29.740
being elected prom king.

10:31.790 --> 10:34.340
Pointing out that kings aren't elected.

10:36.630 --> 10:38.670
It's gonna be off the hook.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.570
And while you're at it,

10:41.570 --> 10:44.190
I know that at this age your hormones are raging,

10:44.190 --> 10:45.790
but just because all your friends are having sex

10:45.790 --> 10:47.700
doesn't mean you have to.

10:49.620 --> 10:51.470
Why would you say that?

10:52.220 --> 10:53.390
You know, 'cause...

10:53.390 --> 10:56.020
'cause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night.

10:56.020 --> 10:57.750
Penny implied the same thing.

10:57.750 --> 10:58.820
Is this true?

10:58.820 --> 11:01.370
Just relax, it's a joke.

11:01.370 --> 11:03.630
You don't have hormones.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.550
Wow, you look amazing.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.720
Thank you, so do you.

11:17.720 --> 11:20.370
Sheldon, you look so handsome.

11:20.960 --> 11:22.370
Thank you.

11:23.300 --> 11:25.450
Sheldon, doesn't Amy look hot?

11:25.450 --> 11:28.580
That's got to put some starch in the upper flermin.

11:30.730 --> 11:31.840
What's that?

11:31.840 --> 11:33.580
Oh, it's a scaly genital organ

11:33.580 --> 11:35.280
that grows between his shoulder blades.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.400
Try not to touch it when you're dancing.

11:39.620 --> 11:40.810
Excuse me.

11:40.810 --> 11:41.780
Where are you going?

11:41.780 --> 11:43.240
I can't do this.

11:43.240 --> 11:44.450
And for your information, Leonard,

11:44.450 --> 11:46.540
the upper flermin doesn't grow between my shoulder blades,

11:46.540 --> 11:49.000
it grows out of the belly button on my neck.

11:53.500 --> 11:56.060
He's right, I was thinking of the lower flermin.

11:58.540 --> 12:01.420
Ooh, I'll, uh, text Stuart, let him know we're close.

12:01.930 --> 12:03.150
That's a neat tattoo.

12:03.150 --> 12:06.280
Oh, thanks, it's Sally from Nightmare before Christmas.

12:06.280 --> 12:07.980
Aw, that movie's so cute.

12:07.980 --> 12:10.010
Do you like her because you both have red hair?

12:10.010 --> 12:12.610
Uh, a little, but more that she's covered in scars

12:12.610 --> 12:15.600
and can pull her own limbs off and sew them back on.

12:17.520 --> 12:19.500
I like Cinderella.

12:21.760 --> 12:23.430
Did you know, in the original book,

12:23.430 --> 12:25.410
the sisters cut off their toes with knives

12:25.410 --> 12:27.670
in order to fit in the glass slipper?

12:28.620 --> 12:31.440
I like "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo."

12:32.880 --> 12:34.870
Hey, here comes Stuart and his date.

12:34.870 --> 12:36.120
Oh, she's cute.

12:37.180 --> 12:38.870
Oh, my God.

12:38.870 --> 12:39.540
What?

12:39.540 --> 12:40.800
That's Jeanie.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.090
That's Jeanie?!

12:42.090 --> 12:43.280
- Who's Jeanie? - Don't say it.

12:43.280 --> 12:46.000
That's Howard's cousin that he had sex with.

12:49.060 --> 12:50.520
She is my second cousin.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.660
We were 15... I just said, "don't say it."

12:54.760 --> 12:55.800
No, it's okay.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.470
He told me that story a long time ago.

12:57.470 --> 12:58.390
Raj!

12:58.390 --> 12:59.390
It was our first date,

12:59.390 --> 13:00.540
there was an awkward silence.

13:00.540 --> 13:02.590
What was I supposed to say?

13:09.320 --> 13:11.030
Oh, it's beautiful.

13:11.860 --> 13:13.550
Oh, the girls really did a nice job.

13:14.490 --> 13:15.940
I know I wasn't into this before,

13:15.940 --> 13:18.920
but I'm so glad I get to take you to your first prom.

13:19.100 --> 13:20.910
What makes you think I didn't go to my prom?

13:20.910 --> 13:22.830
- I went. - Well, who'd you go with?

13:22.830 --> 13:26.980
I took a little lady I like to call loneliness.

13:28.520 --> 13:29.250
Aw, it's all right.

13:29.250 --> 13:30.730
We ended up having a threesome

13:30.730 --> 13:32.560
with her friend humiliation, so...

13:35.220 --> 13:37.110
Well, if I would have been there and saw you alone,

13:37.110 --> 13:38.260
I would've asked you to dance.

13:38.260 --> 13:39.280
No, you wouldn't have.

13:39.280 --> 13:40.340
Well, you don't know that.

13:40.340 --> 13:42.020
It was before my growth spurt.

13:42.020 --> 13:43.570
What, that already happened?

13:46.260 --> 13:47.200
Very funny.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.660
Well, you wouldn't have asked me either.

13:48.660 --> 13:50.160
I would have asked you.

13:51.140 --> 13:52.560
In my head.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.540
On the way home.

13:56.290 --> 13:58.510
While I was having a good cry.

14:04.940 --> 14:06.630
Sheldon, can I come in?

14:06.630 --> 14:08.740
I don't think that's a good idea.

14:08.740 --> 14:10.050
Why not?

14:10.050 --> 14:11.770
According to an online message board,

14:11.770 --> 14:13.850
I may be having a panic attack.

14:13.850 --> 14:17.360
SoccerMom09 had similar symptoms.

14:18.180 --> 14:21.980
But to be fair, the twins were a real handful that day.

14:22.850 --> 14:23.930
You're making me worry.

14:23.930 --> 14:25.400
What's going on?

14:25.840 --> 14:29.040
What's going on is we're about to go to a prom.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.550
And there's a great deal of pressure

14:30.550 --> 14:32.650
on young couples like us to engage in

14:32.650 --> 14:36.030
what Mr. Bob Eubanks called making whoopee.

14:37.080 --> 14:38.070
What pressure?

14:38.070 --> 14:39.800
All I said was you look handsome.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.770
Can you please open the door?

14:42.250 --> 14:44.240
It's not just that.

14:44.240 --> 14:47.090
Leonard and Penny also made comments about it.

14:47.090 --> 14:48.680
And I'm not blind.

14:48.680 --> 14:51.040
Even I looked twice when I saw my posterior

14:51.040 --> 14:53.330
in these tuxedo pants.

14:55.810 --> 14:57.890
So, I met Jeanie at your Aunt Gladys'.

14:57.890 --> 14:59.360
She passed me the Manischewitz,

14:59.360 --> 15:01.010
I took one look at this punim,

15:01.010 --> 15:03.640
and I almost plotzed on the kugel.

15:06.570 --> 15:09.160
Is this what I sound like when I talk about India?

15:11.340 --> 15:13.470
So, my mother's okay with this?

15:13.470 --> 15:16.050
Why would your mother have a problem with me and Stuart?

15:16.050 --> 15:19.260
'Cause they have a weird, inappropriate relationship.

15:19.260 --> 15:22.800
Weirder than what you and I did in my dad's Corolla?

15:25.570 --> 15:27.130
This is so messed up.

15:27.130 --> 15:29.570
I know, I'm having the best time.

15:31.020 --> 15:32.770
Why would you even come to this?

15:32.770 --> 15:34.460
Didn't you know I'd be here?

15:34.460 --> 15:36.400
It was a long time ago, Howard.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.760
And you're only second cousins, who cares?

15:38.760 --> 15:41.230
So, you knew and you brought her anyway?

15:41.230 --> 15:44.050
Oh, so she's good enough for Howard, but not for me?!

15:44.050 --> 15:44.640
Yeah.

15:44.640 --> 15:46.100
Yeah, go have weird relationships

15:46.100 --> 15:47.430
with your own mother and cousin.

15:47.430 --> 15:48.310
This is his turf.

15:48.310 --> 15:49.800
Yeah.

15:53.170 --> 15:55.470
Well, I might not have asked you to dance then,

15:55.470 --> 15:58.330
- but I will ask you now. - There's no music.

15:58.330 --> 15:59.300
I don't care.

15:59.300 --> 16:00.930
We'll make our own music.

16:00.930 --> 16:03.010
My God, who's the dork now?

16:10.900 --> 16:13.070
Thank you for wearing your flats.

16:13.070 --> 16:15.760
Thank you for wearing your heels.

16:19.220 --> 16:20.680
Look at me.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.900
Dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom.

16:24.420 --> 16:25.760
Want to take a picture of us and send it

16:25.760 --> 16:28.020
to your old friends in the chess club?

16:28.740 --> 16:31.780
I sent them a bikini shot of you years ago.

16:35.420 --> 16:36.990
This is nice.

16:37.680 --> 16:39.710
I kind of wish no one else was coming.

16:39.940 --> 16:41.980
I know, me, too.

16:42.890 --> 16:46.170
But it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama.

16:49.080 --> 16:50.630
Howie, get off of him!

16:50.630 --> 16:54.390
Not until he stops humping his way up my family tree!

16:56.460 --> 16:58.380
Sheldon, this is silly.

16:58.380 --> 16:59.920
I'm not missing another prom.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.120
I'm going upstairs now.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.540
Good-bye.

17:03.550 --> 17:06.120
I really did think you looked pretty.

17:06.580 --> 17:07.790
You did?

17:08.240 --> 17:09.160
Yes.

17:09.950 --> 17:12.670
So much so that I started to panic.

17:12.670 --> 17:14.500
Well, you can relax.

17:15.190 --> 17:17.150
Just because you think I look pretty

17:17.610 --> 17:20.910
doesn't mean we have to spend the night together.

17:21.620 --> 17:24.100
Were you hoping we would because it's prom?

17:24.100 --> 17:26.410
I'm always hoping.

17:27.440 --> 17:31.480
But tonight I just wanted to have a nice time with you.

17:31.900 --> 17:35.570
And maybe dance with someone who has arms.

17:36.900 --> 17:38.820
Thank you for understanding.

17:38.820 --> 17:41.090
Of course I understand.

17:43.220 --> 17:44.600
Sheldon,

17:45.910 --> 17:47.730
there's something else I've been wanting to say,

17:47.730 --> 17:49.450
but before I do, I just...

17:50.610 --> 17:53.190
I want you to know that you don't have to say it back.

17:53.190 --> 17:54.450
I know you're not ready,

17:54.450 --> 17:56.370
and I don't want you to say it

17:56.370 --> 17:58.230
just because social convention dictates...

17:58.230 --> 17:59.980
I love you, too.

18:04.540 --> 18:06.170
You said it.

18:06.660 --> 18:08.500
There's no denying I have feelings for you

18:08.500 --> 18:11.090
that can't be explained in any other way.

18:12.130 --> 18:15.910
I briefly considered that I had a brain parasite.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.560
But that seems even more farfetched.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.390
The only conclusion was love.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.290
I know what's happening.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.500
This is a panic attack.

18:35.500 --> 18:38.170
SoccerMom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated.

18:38.170 --> 18:39.550
Okay.

18:41.110 --> 18:42.510
Just because I love you doesn't mean

18:42.510 --> 18:44.820
girls are allowed in my room.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.230
Okay.

18:58.230 --> 19:00.410
Here we go...

19:00.410 --> 19:02.410
Say "Cheese"!

19:05.300 --> 19:07.150
Say "Cheese"!

19:10.610 --> 19:13.190
Say "Cousin"!

19:16.490 --> 19:17.320
Say...

19:17.970 --> 19:19.220
Oh, sorry.

19:19.220 --> 19:21.160
Hang on, sorry.

19:23.220 --> 19:24.670
Hey, Debbie.

19:25.180 --> 19:27.590
I... Yeah, yeah, I'm here with Jeanie.

19:28.160 --> 19:30.400
Okay, but we're just friends.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.510
It's... Yeah.

19:32.670 --> 19:33.790
I got to go.
