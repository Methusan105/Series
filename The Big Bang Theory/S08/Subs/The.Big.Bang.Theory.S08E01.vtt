WEBVTT

00:02.040 --> 00:04.020
Previously on The Big Bang Theory.

00:04.020 --> 00:05.770
We were worried about you.

00:06.250 --> 00:08.050
Don't be melodramatic.

00:08.050 --> 00:10.860
I'm just getting on a train and leaving forever.

00:12.920 --> 00:14.990
So a few things don't go your way

00:14.990 --> 00:16.040
and your best decision

00:16.040 --> 00:18.530
is to ride the rails like a hobo?

00:19.320 --> 00:21.450
Leonard, I am overwhelmed.

00:21.500 --> 00:22.600
Everything is changing,

00:22.600 --> 00:24.590
and it's simply too much.

00:24.590 --> 00:26.540
I need to get away and think.

00:27.300 --> 00:28.470
Sheldon...

00:28.840 --> 00:30.210
Yes?

00:30.210 --> 00:32.080
I'm gonna miss you.

00:32.080 --> 00:34.060
Of course you are.

00:35.810 --> 00:37.760
You just made that easier.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.320
Excuse me.

00:47.800 --> 00:49.170
Is it at all possible

00:49.170 --> 00:52.240
that you're knitting a pair of pants?

00:53.320 --> 00:55.580
Oh, well, no, you're understandably terrified.

00:55.580 --> 00:57.650
But, you know, allow me to explain.

00:58.160 --> 01:00.970
45 days ago, um, I embarked on

01:00.970 --> 01:02.860
a railroad journey of healing

01:02.860 --> 01:04.460
because my university

01:04.460 --> 01:05.970
was making me do string theory,

01:05.970 --> 01:08.190
and my favorite comic book store burned down,

01:08.190 --> 01:10.240
and when my roommate got engaged,

01:10.240 --> 01:12.210
my girlfriend wanted to move in with me,

01:12.210 --> 01:15.270
which was no doubt a ploy just to see my--

01:15.270 --> 01:19.430
well, excuse my language, but my bathing suit parts.

01:21.520 --> 01:23.590
Uh, sir, may I use your phone?

01:23.590 --> 01:25.580
- I don't think so. - Yeah, well,

01:25.580 --> 01:27.260
I understand that I'm half naked,

01:27.260 --> 01:29.240
but there is a reasonable explanation.

01:29.240 --> 01:31.870
While I slept in my sleeper car,

01:31.870 --> 01:33.820
all my possessions were stolen.

01:33.820 --> 01:36.260
Now, typically, I wear pajamas,

01:36.260 --> 01:40.210
but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle

01:40.210 --> 01:43.660
and pajamas are the sleep-pants of the man.

01:46.180 --> 01:48.850
I'll have you know, Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants

01:48.850 --> 01:51.150
and a nation rallied behind him!

01:51.810 --> 01:52.740
My good man...

01:52.740 --> 01:53.910
Now, before you walk away...

01:54.000 --> 01:55.760
I know that I may appear deranged,

01:55.760 --> 01:58.460
but I am, in fact, a world-renowned physicist.

01:58.460 --> 02:01.530
Ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion.

02:01.530 --> 02:03.090
Go ahead, ask!

02:05.510 --> 02:07.630
Bosons have integer spin,

02:07.630 --> 02:09.800
fermions have half-integer spin!

02:09.800 --> 02:11.290
My legs are getting cold!

02:11.290 --> 02:13.480
Why won't anybody help me?

02:40.940 --> 02:41.660
Morning.

02:41.660 --> 02:43.480
Hi. Want to do yoga with me?

02:43.480 --> 02:45.520
Um, let me just have some coffee first,

02:45.520 --> 02:46.980
and then I'll have the strength to tell you

02:46.980 --> 02:49.050
how much I won't be doing that.

02:52.880 --> 02:53.770
Hello?

02:53.770 --> 02:55.220
Hello, Leonard.

02:55.650 --> 02:57.740
Hey, buddy. Good to hear your voice.

02:58.090 --> 03:00.200
Uh, I'm in Kingman, Arizona,

03:00.200 --> 03:03.260
and, uh, I need you to come pick me up.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.350
I'd love to.

03:05.350 --> 03:07.960
I'm just about to do yoga with Penny.

03:10.120 --> 03:11.830
Leonard, I'm at the police station.

03:11.830 --> 03:12.920
I was robbed.

03:12.920 --> 03:14.230
Th...They took my phone,

03:14.230 --> 03:16.610
my wallet, my iPad, everything.

03:16.610 --> 03:18.210
Oh, my God, are you okay?

03:18.210 --> 03:19.580
No, I'm not okay.

03:19.580 --> 03:21.820
I-I'm wearing borrowed pants,

03:22.500 --> 03:23.690
I-I don't have I.D.,

03:23.690 --> 03:25.200
and one of the officers here

03:25.200 --> 03:27.570
won't stop calling me Chicken Legs.

03:28.460 --> 03:29.150
Okay.

03:29.150 --> 03:30.260
Uh, I'll...I'll come get you.

03:30.260 --> 03:30.960
What's the address?

03:30.960 --> 03:32.090
Hey, what's going on?

03:32.090 --> 03:33.620
He got all of his stuff stolen.

03:35.550 --> 03:36.240
Okay...

03:36.240 --> 03:37.290
Hurry.

03:37.290 --> 03:38.600
Sheldon, hang tight.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.020
Hey, do you want me to bring anything?

03:40.020 --> 03:41.230
Oh, yes, please.

03:41.240 --> 03:42.410
A pair of pants.

03:42.410 --> 03:43.670
And my toothbrush.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.410
Yeah, and my mail.

03:45.410 --> 03:47.340
And a really good comeback for chicken legs,

03:47.350 --> 03:49.540
because "I know you are, but what am I?"

03:49.540 --> 03:52.100
was met with stony silence.

03:52.740 --> 03:54.270
I'll be there as soon as I can.

03:54.270 --> 03:55.110
Is he okay?

03:55.110 --> 03:57.110
Yeah, he's fine, he's just a little rattled.

03:57.110 --> 03:58.920
Oh... Feel like driving to Arizona with me?

03:58.920 --> 04:00.260
I can't, I have that job interview.

04:00.260 --> 04:01.660
Oh, right. Besides,

04:01.660 --> 04:03.190
I don't need six hours of "Your hair is different.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.560
Why did you change your hair?

04:04.560 --> 04:06.880
I'm holding my breath until your hair grows back."

04:08.680 --> 04:10.200
All right, fine.

04:10.650 --> 04:11.680
Hey, can you think of a reason

04:11.680 --> 04:14.190
- I shouldn't invite Amy to come with me? - Nope.

04:14.190 --> 04:16.330
Come on, you didn't even try.

04:18.960 --> 04:20.220
Thanks for the lift.

04:20.220 --> 04:21.570
What's wrong with your car?

04:21.570 --> 04:24.650
I'm having my windows untinted.

04:25.520 --> 04:26.710
Why?

04:26.710 --> 04:27.680
Got a hot girlfriend now.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.910
I want the haters to know.

04:30.300 --> 04:31.200
What are you talking about?

04:31.200 --> 04:33.110
No one's paying attention to you.

04:34.410 --> 04:36.890
How's that Hater-ade taste, bro?

04:38.280 --> 04:39.660
Hey, this isn't the way to work.

04:39.660 --> 04:42.800
I just want to pop in and make sure Ma's okay.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.500
I thought Stuart was looking after her.

04:44.500 --> 04:48.020
He was, but now that her cast is off, he moved out.

04:48.020 --> 04:49.340
And honestly, I'm kind of glad.

04:49.340 --> 04:50.990
It was getting a little weird.

04:50.990 --> 04:52.200
How so?

04:52.240 --> 04:53.340
I don't know, they're...

04:54.150 --> 04:55.900
chummy.

04:56.300 --> 04:57.840
Like us?

04:57.840 --> 04:59.210
No, not like us.

04:59.210 --> 05:00.490
Creepy chummy,

05:00.490 --> 05:02.230
like you and your dog.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.930
She feeds him out of her own mouth?

05:07.290 --> 05:09.580
I mean, he calls her Debbie,

05:09.580 --> 05:11.300
she calls him Stewie

05:11.300 --> 05:13.590
and they're all giggly around each other.

05:13.590 --> 05:15.020
And believe me, when food goes in that mouth,

05:15.020 --> 05:17.250
it does not come out.

05:18.140 --> 05:19.160
So are you worried

05:19.160 --> 05:21.880
because he's replacing you as a son

05:21.880 --> 05:24.750
or are you worried because he's becoming her lover?

05:24.750 --> 05:27.290
First of all, no one can replace me as a son.

05:27.290 --> 05:29.310
I'm her little matzo ball.

05:30.300 --> 05:32.150
And secondly, my mother is well past

05:32.150 --> 05:34.560
having any kind of sex life.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.290
Okay, okay.

05:38.250 --> 05:40.080
Although many older women lead vibrant, active...

05:40.080 --> 05:42.210
I said well past it!

05:45.710 --> 05:47.320
Excuse me, Officer Hernandez?

05:47.320 --> 05:50.470
Any leads on the person who stole my belongings?

05:50.470 --> 05:51.140
Not yet.

05:51.140 --> 05:52.820
Well, perhaps I can help.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.930
Sherlock Holmes always says

05:55.630 --> 05:57.730
when you eliminate the impossible,

05:57.730 --> 06:00.020
whatever remains, however improbable,

06:00.020 --> 06:01.320
must be the truth.

06:01.320 --> 06:04.300
Now, have-have you tried doing that?

06:05.270 --> 06:06.690
Nope.

06:07.350 --> 06:09.500
Well, maybe you should.

06:10.140 --> 06:12.820
Th-Th-There's lots of books called "Sherlock Holmes"

06:12.820 --> 06:15.830
and there's no books called "Officer Hernandez."

06:22.540 --> 06:23.980
Thanks again for coming.

06:23.980 --> 06:26.740
Six hours was gonna be a long drive by myself.

06:26.740 --> 06:28.050
My pleasure.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.110
And I'm not angry at all

06:30.110 --> 06:32.460
that my boyfriend was in trouble and called you instead of me.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.090
I love that!

06:36.500 --> 06:39.400
Yeah, time's gonna fly by.

06:42.140 --> 06:44.040
I haven't been on a job interview in years.

06:44.040 --> 06:45.170
I'm really nervous.

06:45.170 --> 06:46.210
Don't be.

06:46.210 --> 06:48.090
You are built for pharmaceutical sales.

06:48.090 --> 06:50.960
You're cute, you're flirty and...

06:50.960 --> 06:53.600
Started that like there were gonna be three things.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.060
I don't have any experience in sales.

06:58.060 --> 07:00.210
Unless you count the bikini car wash I did in high school.

07:00.210 --> 07:03.010
But you already made me take that off my resume?

07:04.190 --> 07:06.330
This job is a lot like being a waitress,

07:06.330 --> 07:08.330
except instead of pushing the fish tacos

07:08.330 --> 07:09.580
'cause they're about to go bad,

07:09.580 --> 07:11.180
you're just pushing our antidepressants

07:11.180 --> 07:15.330
before the FDA finds out they may cause rectal bleeding.

07:16.620 --> 07:17.700
They do?

07:18.540 --> 07:19.750
Maybe.

07:21.060 --> 07:22.870
But like our lawyers say, the world is full of things

07:22.870 --> 07:25.090
that can cause a rectum to bleed.

07:27.300 --> 07:28.500
Anyway, I talked you up to Dan.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.030
He's the guy who'll be interviewing you.

07:30.040 --> 07:31.430
Oh, I really appreciate this.

07:31.440 --> 07:33.140
I just hope I'm not in over my head.

07:33.140 --> 07:35.070
You'll be fine. Just be yourself.

07:35.070 --> 07:36.710
- I wish I felt more confident. - Penny,

07:36.710 --> 07:38.270
I wouldn't have put you up for this job

07:38.280 --> 07:39.510
if I didn't think you could handle it.

07:39.510 --> 07:41.810
Oh, thank you, but maybe I should cancel.

07:41.810 --> 07:43.710
It's too late to cancel. You're going.

07:43.720 --> 07:45.550
But I don't know anything about pharmaceuticals.

07:45.550 --> 07:46.980
Oh, I understand.

07:46.990 --> 07:49.620
You want to do something you're already good at.

07:49.620 --> 07:50.400
I know.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.310
Why don't I get you a job at

07:51.310 --> 07:54.980
the Sitting Around All Day Wearing Yoga Pants Factory?

07:58.870 --> 08:01.060
They're comfortable.

08:03.560 --> 08:06.550
Ma, I hope you're decent. Raj is here!

08:06.550 --> 08:07.900
You just started seeing naked women again,

08:07.910 --> 08:09.240
and I don't want you to be confused

08:09.240 --> 08:11.020
about where the boobs should be.

08:12.930 --> 08:14.370
Oh, hey, guys.

08:14.370 --> 08:15.570
What are you doing here?

08:15.570 --> 08:18.030
Uh... w-what are you doing here?

08:18.030 --> 08:19.150
I thought you moved out.

08:19.150 --> 08:21.080
Oh, yeah, I was going to,

08:21.080 --> 08:22.860
and then Debbie and I got to talking

08:22.860 --> 08:24.180
over dinner the other night.

08:24.180 --> 08:25.710
I didn't have anyplace to go,

08:25.710 --> 08:27.150
she likes having me around,

08:27.150 --> 08:30.370
so we both said, "Why leave?" at the same time.

08:31.460 --> 08:33.380
It was precious.

08:34.570 --> 08:36.560
It's not that precious.

08:37.130 --> 08:38.100
I'd like to back you up,

08:38.100 --> 08:40.820
but it sounds like it was pretty precious.

08:44.620 --> 08:47.780
Stewie, I can't find my glasses!

08:47.780 --> 08:50.300
Be right there, Deb Deb!

08:51.240 --> 08:52.810
They're probably on her head.

08:53.990 --> 08:56.290
Or in her neck. Listen.

08:57.850 --> 09:00.090
You staying here seems like something

09:00.090 --> 09:02.150
she would've talked to me about.

09:02.150 --> 09:06.080
Well, maybe if you called your mother more often, you'd know.

09:08.930 --> 09:10.890
It wouldn't kill you to pick up the phone.

09:26.460 --> 09:28.340
Any word on my stolen items?

09:28.340 --> 09:30.210
We're doing everything we can.

09:31.270 --> 09:32.690
You know, Sherlock Holmes

09:32.690 --> 09:35.660
liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus.

09:37.960 --> 09:41.450
But I'm sure those Cool Ranch Doritos are doing the trick.

09:43.480 --> 09:44.230
Sheldon.

09:44.820 --> 09:45.770
Leonard!

09:45.770 --> 09:48.190
Oh, I'm so happy to see you.

09:48.640 --> 09:50.550
- Are you okay? - Oh, I'm fine.

09:50.550 --> 09:52.890
Why did you come?

09:53.760 --> 09:55.540
What do you mean, why did I come?

09:55.540 --> 09:56.320
You're my boyfriend.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.200
I haven't seen you in over a month.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.240
I just drove six hours to help you out.

10:00.240 --> 10:01.460
Don't you have anything to say besides,

10:01.460 --> 10:03.470
"Why did you come?"

10:04.130 --> 10:05.560
I do, but...

10:05.560 --> 10:07.380
I feel uncomfortable saying it out loud

10:07.380 --> 10:09.800
in front of these police officers.

10:10.840 --> 10:11.800
Fine.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.130
Whisper it.

10:17.840 --> 10:19.260
Shotgun.

10:28.330 --> 10:30.080
So, Sheldon, tell us about your trip.

10:30.080 --> 10:31.220
Where'd you go?

10:31.220 --> 10:32.660
Where didn't I go?

10:32.660 --> 10:35.010
I went to New York, Chicago,

10:35.010 --> 10:38.290
Atlanta, Denver, Seattle.

10:38.290 --> 10:39.530
How were they?

10:39.530 --> 10:41.020
Oh, I have no idea.

10:41.020 --> 10:43.530
I never left the train station.

10:44.510 --> 10:46.620
Hang on. You traveled across the entire country

10:46.620 --> 10:48.520
and never left a train station?

10:48.520 --> 10:49.910
Why would I?

10:49.910 --> 10:52.180
That's where all the cool trains are.

10:53.300 --> 10:55.740
I'm sorry, so you never went outside?

10:55.740 --> 10:58.440
Or had a single piece of fruit.

11:01.890 --> 11:02.740
So...

11:03.190 --> 11:03.840
why do you think you'd make

11:03.840 --> 11:07.420
a good pharmaceutical sales rep?

11:07.420 --> 11:09.370
Well, I'm a people person.

11:09.370 --> 11:10.290
People like me.

11:10.290 --> 11:12.330
Some of my favorite people are people.

11:13.820 --> 11:15.330
I feel like I'm saying "people" a lot.

11:15.330 --> 11:17.790
People, people, people, pe... Okay, I'm done.

11:18.780 --> 11:19.930
You sure?

11:20.390 --> 11:21.930
People. Yes.

11:23.150 --> 11:24.030
Good!

11:24.030 --> 11:26.790
So, how do you feel your previous job experience

11:26.790 --> 11:29.800
has prepared you for a career like this?

11:29.800 --> 11:32.920
Uh, well, as a waitress, sales was a big part of my job.

11:32.920 --> 11:35.510
I mean, believe me, I convinced a lot of very large customers,

11:35.510 --> 11:36.980
who should not be eating cheesecake,

11:36.980 --> 11:38.820
to have more cheesecake.

11:39.670 --> 11:40.450
I mean,

11:40.450 --> 11:43.060
one of those chubsters even had an insulin pump!

11:45.950 --> 11:48.620
I have an insulin pump.

11:52.030 --> 11:53.430
People.

11:56.150 --> 11:57.580
It's weird, right?

11:57.580 --> 12:00.950
A grown man in his 30s living with my mother.

12:00.950 --> 12:02.280
That is weird.

12:02.280 --> 12:04.750
I thought he was, like, 45.

12:05.450 --> 12:07.090
Come on, you don't think it's a little odd?

12:07.090 --> 12:09.580
I don't know! I mean, she's lonely.

12:09.580 --> 12:11.040
He needs a place to stay.

12:11.040 --> 12:13.030
I doubt there's any funny business going on.

12:13.030 --> 12:14.630
And even if there was, who cares?

12:14.630 --> 12:15.670
They're both adults.

12:15.670 --> 12:17.110
"Who cares"?! You wouldn't care

12:17.110 --> 12:19.200
if I slept with your mom?

12:19.200 --> 12:21.000
You know what? You're my best friend,

12:21.000 --> 12:22.070
and she's in a bad marriage.

12:22.070 --> 12:24.320
I give you my blessing.

12:25.700 --> 12:26.470
This is stupid.

12:26.470 --> 12:30.000
I'm just gonna call my mother and be honest with her.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.620
'Cause that's what little matzo balls do.

12:37.000 --> 12:37.850
This is Debbie!

12:37.850 --> 12:39.270
And this is Stuart!

12:40.810 --> 12:43.240
Just kidding!

12:44.210 --> 12:46.130
Leave a message!

12:49.840 --> 12:52.280
This is the part where you talk.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.020
All right, let's say a physician was prescribing

12:57.020 --> 12:58.870
one of our competitor's drugs.

12:58.870 --> 13:01.530
How would you convince them to switch to ours?

13:08.380 --> 13:12.090
Any chance his car needs to be washed by a girl in a bikini?

13:14.630 --> 13:15.690
No...

13:16.330 --> 13:18.280
Okay, I'm really sorry for wasting your time.

13:18.280 --> 13:21.100
Don't worry about it. Thanks for stopping by.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.140
Okay, thanks.

13:24.520 --> 13:27.500
Um, I'm sor... listen, could you do me a favor

13:27.500 --> 13:30.370
and not tell Bernadette how badly I blew this interview?

13:30.830 --> 13:31.600
She'll get upset.

13:31.600 --> 13:35.050
And honestly I'm a... a little terrified of her.

13:37.660 --> 13:39.070
Wait, wait. You're scared of Bernadette?

13:39.070 --> 13:40.940
Yeah, kind of.

13:40.940 --> 13:43.730
I thought it was just me!

13:45.700 --> 13:47.540
E-Everyone thinks she's so nice

13:47.540 --> 13:50.220
with that squeaky little voice.

13:50.870 --> 13:52.910
I know, but she's kind of a bully!

13:53.440 --> 13:54.470
She is!

13:54.470 --> 13:56.380
I-I didn't even want to meet you,

13:56.380 --> 13:59.920
but, uh, I was too scared to say no to her.

14:00.480 --> 14:01.700
Me, too!

14:01.700 --> 14:03.280
Yeah, yeah! One-one time, I had...

14:03.280 --> 14:04.880
Oh! I had to tell her

14:04.880 --> 14:06.470
we were cutting the-the research funding

14:06.470 --> 14:08.170
for one of the drugs she was developing.

14:08.180 --> 14:09.410
What happened?

14:10.330 --> 14:11.150
I couldn't do it!

14:11.150 --> 14:12.630
She's still working on it!

14:18.410 --> 14:19.450
We're not gonna tell her about this, right?

14:19.450 --> 14:21.700
- Oh, my God, no! - No, no...

14:22.940 --> 14:25.550
At the hot dog stand in the Denver train station--

14:25.550 --> 14:26.840
Heinz ketchup.

14:26.840 --> 14:29.730
At the hot dog stand in the Salt Lake City train station--

14:29.730 --> 14:31.180
Heinz ketchup.

14:31.230 --> 14:34.670
At the hot dog stand in the Indianapolis train station...

14:36.720 --> 14:38.320
I don't care.

14:40.540 --> 14:42.110
Wrong! Hunt's!

14:43.740 --> 14:45.140
Hey, Amy! What do you say?

14:45.150 --> 14:47.450
You ready to move on to the mustard round?

14:47.570 --> 14:50.010
Have you not noticed that I've been sitting back here

14:50.010 --> 14:53.290
quietly stewing for the past two hours?

14:54.150 --> 14:56.300
I just thought you were bad at the game.

14:57.520 --> 14:59.270
I'm mad at you!

14:59.900 --> 15:01.220
How could you just go away like that

15:01.220 --> 15:02.570
without even saying good-bye,

15:02.570 --> 15:05.320
and then call Leonard for help instead of me?

15:07.900 --> 15:09.160
Amy?

15:09.160 --> 15:11.150
May I please have a moment of privacy

15:11.150 --> 15:13.530
to speak with my roommate?

15:14.190 --> 15:16.270
We're in a moving car!

15:18.560 --> 15:19.710
What do you expect me to do?

15:19.710 --> 15:22.000
Stick my fingers in my ears?

15:22.000 --> 15:23.970
Well, I was thinking put your head out the window like a dog,

15:23.970 --> 15:25.440
but that'll work.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.250
Please? This'll be quick.

15:33.120 --> 15:34.220
Leonard?

15:34.220 --> 15:36.150
As soon as we get home,

15:36.150 --> 15:38.860
I want to have coitus with Amy.

15:45.940 --> 15:47.690
Okay, she can't hear.

15:50.530 --> 15:52.130
The reason I called you

15:52.130 --> 15:54.630
is because I didn't want Amy

15:54.630 --> 15:57.680
to know I couldn't make it on my own.

15:58.170 --> 15:59.530
What's the big deal?

15:59.530 --> 16:01.950
Oh, of course it's no big deal to you.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.390
You idolize me, and nothing could ever knock me

16:04.390 --> 16:06.660
off that pedestal you put me on.

16:07.620 --> 16:08.470
Well, yeah, it's true.

16:08.470 --> 16:10.530
You-you are a god to me.

16:11.970 --> 16:13.420
Can I stop now?

16:13.420 --> 16:15.190
Just tell her.

16:18.100 --> 16:20.190
I called Leonard because...

16:20.190 --> 16:21.320
I failed.

16:21.320 --> 16:25.600
And I didn't want you to think less of me.

16:25.600 --> 16:28.180
You were worried about that?

16:29.510 --> 16:30.960
Yes.

16:33.640 --> 16:35.490
Sheldon...

16:36.380 --> 16:39.770
it's okay with me that you're not perfect.

16:44.290 --> 16:47.000
Can I have one more moment with Leonard?

16:47.000 --> 16:49.080
Sure.

16:56.060 --> 16:58.860
Amy just hurt my feelings. I want to break up with her.

17:02.790 --> 17:04.830
Now, I never thought I'd say this,

17:04.830 --> 17:07.480
but I'm kind of excited to see Sheldon.

17:08.120 --> 17:11.420
I never thought I'd say this, but Penny got a job today.

17:12.430 --> 17:13.590
She did?

17:13.590 --> 17:15.200
Well, the only reason she got it

17:15.200 --> 17:17.960
is 'cause the guy who interviewed her loves me.

17:24.570 --> 17:26.400
What do you want?

17:26.400 --> 17:28.890
I, uh, kind of got the feeling

17:28.890 --> 17:32.010
you might not be okay with me staying at your mom's.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.520
You're right, I'm not.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.970
I think it's weird.

17:34.970 --> 17:35.600
Howie?

17:35.600 --> 17:36.610
It is. He's a grown man.

17:36.610 --> 17:38.720
He's just gonna live there rent-free?

17:38.720 --> 17:40.090
How is that gonna motivate him

17:40.090 --> 17:42.090
to get off his butt and get a job?

17:42.090 --> 17:44.720
I mean, do you even have a plan?

17:44.720 --> 17:47.150
Hey, you're not my father, okay?

17:47.150 --> 17:49.300
And besides, your mother and I were talking...

17:49.300 --> 17:51.940
"Your mother and I"? You're not my father!

17:51.940 --> 17:53.650
- I didn't say I was your father! - Well, I didn't say

17:53.650 --> 17:55.500
- I was your father! - Okay, calm down.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.240
You're not his father, he's not your father!

17:57.240 --> 17:59.960
Nobody's anybody's father.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.300
I-I'm sorry you don't like my life choices,

18:02.300 --> 18:03.280
but it's my life!

18:03.280 --> 18:05.710
Well, it's my house, it's my rules!

18:06.510 --> 18:08.020
Okay, Dad!

18:08.020 --> 18:10.310
If I mow the lawn, can I have my allowance?

18:10.310 --> 18:12.510
Hey, don't you take that sarcastic tone with him!

18:12.510 --> 18:13.760
I don't have to listen to you!

18:13.760 --> 18:14.980
Don't talk to her like that!

18:14.980 --> 18:16.660
That is my mother... Wife!

18:16.660 --> 18:18.880
My wife! I said my wife!

18:19.500 --> 18:20.110
You know what?

18:20.110 --> 18:21.770
This isn't getting us anywhere.

18:21.770 --> 18:24.820
When you're ready to apologize, you know where to find me.

18:24.820 --> 18:26.640
Well, yeah, in my house!

18:26.640 --> 18:29.010
That's right, sucka!

18:32.070 --> 18:34.640
I wish I'd never gone on that trip.

18:34.640 --> 18:37.210
I feel no better now than when I left.

18:37.210 --> 18:38.780
But you still accomplished something.

18:38.780 --> 18:40.480
Yeah. If you had told anyone

18:40.480 --> 18:43.530
that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country,

18:43.530 --> 18:45.250
do you know what they would have said?

18:45.250 --> 18:47.290
- That I couldn't do it? - Exactly.

18:47.290 --> 18:49.750
Right after they said, "Yay!"

18:51.190 --> 18:52.820
But you did do it.

18:52.830 --> 18:54.890
So what if it didn't all go your way?

18:54.900 --> 18:57.160
That's what makes it an adventure.

18:57.160 --> 18:59.260
That's a good point.

18:59.270 --> 19:02.350
Yeah, I'm a lot like Gandalf the Grey.

19:03.150 --> 19:05.140
He fought the Balrog and emerged

19:05.140 --> 19:07.780
stronger than ever as Gandalf the White.

19:07.780 --> 19:10.400
I was robbed of my phone and pants,

19:10.400 --> 19:12.740
and I, too, came back stronger.

19:12.740 --> 19:13.920
And whiter, too,

19:13.920 --> 19:16.550
'cause I wasn't in direct sunlight for six weeks.

19:17.540 --> 19:20.680
See? This trip was good for you.

19:20.680 --> 19:22.000
Indeed.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.460
I was the world's smartest caterpillar.

19:25.460 --> 19:29.000
And then after pupating in our nation's railway system,

19:29.000 --> 19:30.610
I've burst forth

19:30.610 --> 19:33.810
as the world's smartest butterfly.

19:34.900 --> 19:37.570
Butterfly could've gotten himself home from Arizona.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.730
Yeah, I feel renewed.

19:41.730 --> 19:45.230
I'm ready to deal with any changes that come my way.

19:47.480 --> 19:48.520
Look who's back!

19:48.520 --> 19:50.220
Your hair is different. You changed your hair.

19:50.220 --> 19:52.070
I can't take this. I'm out.

19:57.750 --> 19:59.820
Would you like to see pictures from my trip?

19:59.820 --> 20:01.250
I thought your phone got stolen.

20:01.250 --> 20:03.170
Yeah, it did, but luckily all my photos

20:03.170 --> 20:05.060
got backed up to the Cloud.

20:05.060 --> 20:07.900
And you thought they all had a silver lining.

20:08.360 --> 20:09.700
Here... day one.

20:09.700 --> 20:12.220
Uh, this was the seat I was going to sit

20:12.220 --> 20:13.140
in but didn't

20:13.140 --> 20:15.860
because there were cracker crumbs on it.

20:15.860 --> 20:19.690
As it was first class, I suspect Ritz.

20:20.650 --> 20:23.410
This is the train bathroom.

20:23.410 --> 20:25.440
This is the Imodium I took

20:25.440 --> 20:28.540
so I would never have to use the train bathroom.

20:29.200 --> 20:31.060
I cannot believe you traveled the entire country

20:31.060 --> 20:32.750
and never left the train station.

20:32.750 --> 20:33.770
I know.

20:33.770 --> 20:36.100
You know, I almost died in a fire in Des Moines,

20:36.100 --> 20:37.940
but I stayed put.

20:38.700 --> 20:39.670
FYI...

20:39.670 --> 20:42.110
that's when the Imodium gave out.
