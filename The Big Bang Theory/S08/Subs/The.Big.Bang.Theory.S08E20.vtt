WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.590
- You're wrong. - No, I'm not.

00:04.590 --> 00:06.810
- Yes, you are. - No, I'm not.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.580
Settle this. Those little animated pictures on the Internet,

00:09.580 --> 00:11.700
are they called "Gifs" or "Jifs"?

00:11.700 --> 00:13.520
Well, the G stands for "Graphics."

00:13.520 --> 00:15.380
That's a hard G, so I'd say "Gif."

00:15.380 --> 00:18.060
W... The guy who invented it says it's "Jif."

00:18.060 --> 00:21.990
I'm sorry, do you mean the guy or the juy?

00:22.720 --> 00:24.900
Well, I'll give you three guesses

00:24.900 --> 00:26.780
why I'm so irritated.

00:26.780 --> 00:30.560
Something happened different from the way you wanted it.

00:31.610 --> 00:33.900
I guess news travels fast.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.530
It's true, a select group of scientists

00:36.530 --> 00:38.480
was invited to a weekend symposium

00:38.480 --> 00:40.040
at a former home of Richard Feynman,

00:40.040 --> 00:41.610
and I wasn't included.

00:41.610 --> 00:43.750
Oh, Sheldon, I'm sure it's not because

00:43.750 --> 00:45.670
they don't think you're an elite scientist.

00:45.670 --> 00:46.870
Yeah, I bet you anything

00:46.870 --> 00:50.160
it's just 'cause you're a pain in the ass.

00:50.670 --> 00:53.360
You're just saying that to make me feel better.

00:54.140 --> 00:56.420
Look, you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this.

00:56.420 --> 00:58.500
Agreed.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.760
I was gonna say "or," but why bother?

01:28.810 --> 01:29.600
Hey, Raj.

01:29.600 --> 01:32.440
Hey, I got you a little gift.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.910
Oh, that's a lot of Girl Scout Cookies.

01:34.910 --> 01:36.370
You know me. I'm from India.

01:36.370 --> 01:38.910
I can't resist children begging.

01:40.160 --> 01:42.020
So, how's it going with the title to the house?

01:42.020 --> 01:43.150
Great, it's all done.

01:43.150 --> 01:44.750
The lawyer tracked down my father

01:44.750 --> 01:45.820
and got him to sign it over.

01:45.820 --> 01:47.560
I didn't have to meet him, I didn't have to talk to him,

01:47.560 --> 01:49.620
I don't even know where he is.

01:49.620 --> 01:52.770
Wow, so you're not curious at all?

01:52.770 --> 01:53.800
Nope.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.640
What if he's in prison?

01:55.640 --> 01:56.980
What if he's a spy?

01:56.980 --> 01:59.490
What if he's in a Beatles cover band?

02:00.330 --> 02:02.910
I'm just saying, if he's got your nose and haircut,

02:02.910 --> 02:05.640
he'd make a killer Ringo.

02:07.820 --> 02:09.140
Thanks again for agreeing to do this.

02:09.140 --> 02:11.650
Oh, it's cool; I've never been on a podcast before.

02:11.650 --> 02:13.160
Well, you picked a good one to start.

02:13.160 --> 02:14.570
Wil's had lots of great guests.

02:14.570 --> 02:16.880
Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner,

02:16.880 --> 02:19.280
Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden...

02:19.280 --> 02:20.990
Those are Star Trek people.

02:20.990 --> 02:22.030
Yes!

02:22.030 --> 02:24.390
I only figured that out because I've never heard of any of them.

02:26.230 --> 02:27.250
I deserve that.

02:27.250 --> 02:30.320
I invited you on my show and I drove here.

02:30.320 --> 02:31.630
Sorry.

02:31.630 --> 02:34.200
Okay, so, this is basically gonna be just like a little talk show.

02:34.200 --> 02:35.780
Uh, we're gonna take some calls,

02:35.780 --> 02:37.470
we'll talk about what it was like on the set

02:37.470 --> 02:39.140
of Serial Ape-ist 2.

02:39.140 --> 02:40.050
It should be really fun.

02:40.050 --> 02:41.310
- This is exciting. - Yeah.

02:41.310 --> 02:42.590
So, how many people listen?

02:42.590 --> 02:43.800
Most people download it later,

02:43.800 --> 02:46.110
but usually a few thousand people listen live.

02:46.110 --> 02:48.000
What?! A few thousand people

02:48.000 --> 02:51.150
listen to you talk about nerd stuff?

02:52.160 --> 02:54.390
Again, right in the ears,

02:54.390 --> 02:56.560
straight to the feelings.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.810
Can you please pass the salt?

03:01.720 --> 03:03.130
Sure.

03:03.130 --> 03:05.400
It's not like I was invited to Richard Feynman's house

03:05.400 --> 03:07.660
and have anything better to do.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.690
Is this how the rest of the night's going to be?

03:10.690 --> 03:12.940
I don't know the future.

03:14.750 --> 03:16.220
Do you think there's a chance

03:16.220 --> 03:18.090
that an asteroid could hit the Earth,

03:18.090 --> 03:21.400
destroying Feynman's house and everyone in it?

03:22.650 --> 03:23.850
No, Sheldon.

03:23.850 --> 03:27.010
Then buckle up; you're in for a cranky night.

03:27.550 --> 03:29.930
According to the codicil of the Relationship Agreement

03:29.930 --> 03:31.650
which you insisted upon,

03:31.650 --> 03:34.500
we're not allowed to pout or be moody on date night.

03:34.500 --> 03:39.040
You know I just put that in because of uterus stuff.

03:40.190 --> 03:42.350
Well, it applies to you, too.

03:42.820 --> 03:44.640
I was afraid you might bring this up,

03:44.640 --> 03:48.420
so I have a work-around.

03:52.780 --> 03:54.660
There you go.

03:59.280 --> 04:03.360
As far as you're concerned, I'm smiling.

04:03.360 --> 04:05.700
Although, I must admit, I'm smiling a little bit at the moment

04:05.700 --> 04:08.800
because this loophole is so brilliant.

04:10.580 --> 04:12.250
So, Bernadette, have you thought

04:12.250 --> 04:15.180
about how you're going to redecorate this place?

04:15.180 --> 04:16.680
You know, I'm thinking

04:16.680 --> 04:18.120
ripping up the carpets,

04:18.120 --> 04:19.460
maybe lose the wallpaper,

04:19.460 --> 04:21.000
all new light fixtures...

04:21.000 --> 04:22.830
You know, if you knocked out this wall,

04:22.830 --> 04:24.610
it would give you an open floor plan,

04:24.610 --> 04:28.810
and then-- it's a little scary, but could be fun--

04:28.810 --> 04:31.380
indoor fire pit.

04:33.780 --> 04:36.120
Hey, I grew up in this house, okay?

04:36.120 --> 04:38.440
No one's knocking anything down.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.090
Okay, okay.

04:40.090 --> 04:40.930
When he's at Comic-Con,

04:40.930 --> 04:43.480
I'm bringing in a wrecking ball.

04:46.650 --> 04:47.880
Can I help you?

04:47.880 --> 04:49.870
Hi. Are you Howard Wolowitz?

04:49.870 --> 04:51.340
Yes.

04:51.340 --> 04:53.000
Um, this is a little weird,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.210
but a lawyer was trying to contact my father,

04:55.210 --> 04:58.340
because his name was still on the title for this house.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.430
W... uh, who's your father?

05:00.430 --> 05:02.870
Sam Wolowitz.

05:03.760 --> 05:06.040
S-Sam Wolowitz is my father.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.510
I know.

05:08.620 --> 05:12.390
Well, wait, so if we have the same father...

05:12.390 --> 05:13.910
I mean, are you saying

05:13.910 --> 05:15.670
you're my half-brother?

05:15.670 --> 05:17.350
I think so.

05:18.350 --> 05:21.870
Bernadette, weird things are happening out here.

05:24.450 --> 05:27.630
I think I started to suspect it was a bad movie

05:27.630 --> 05:31.060
when I looked at the script and saw the title,

05:31.770 --> 05:36.090
Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill.

05:36.700 --> 05:37.500
Uh, spoiler alert:

05:37.500 --> 05:40.290
after the monkey sees, it kills.

05:42.820 --> 05:44.490
I've just been handed a note.

05:44.490 --> 05:46.090
I'm going to read it.

05:46.540 --> 05:49.730
"Wil, do you want more Diet Coke?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.890
Also, we have juice."

05:55.440 --> 05:57.310
I-I didn't want to interrupt.

05:58.950 --> 06:01.170
Uh, that voice you just heard belongs to Leonard,

06:01.170 --> 06:02.500
Penny's fiance.

06:02.500 --> 06:04.850
Uh, Leonard, why don't you grab some headphones and join us?

06:04.850 --> 06:06.120
- Really? - Yeah.

06:06.120 --> 06:07.270
Yeah, great.

06:07.270 --> 06:09.090
So, while Leonard gets set up,

06:09.090 --> 06:10.490
let's take a call.

06:10.490 --> 06:11.860
Hello, caller, you are on

06:11.860 --> 06:14.680
with Penny and Wil from Serial Ape-ist 2.

06:14.680 --> 06:15.890
I don't have a question.

06:15.890 --> 06:17.920
I just want to say I'm a big fan of the movie.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.800
I've seen it, like, ten times.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.090
Okay, well, I'll apologize for the first time,

06:22.090 --> 06:24.530
but the other nine are on you.

06:25.940 --> 06:27.180
Thanks a lot, caller.

06:27.180 --> 06:29.680
You know that the movie actually has a little bit of a cult following.

06:29.680 --> 06:30.600
- Really? - Yeah.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.050
I was at a science-fiction convention,

06:32.050 --> 06:35.630
and I saw a woman dressed as your half-ape character.

06:35.630 --> 06:38.990
Oh, if she was with an Indian guy dressed like a banana,

06:38.990 --> 06:41.970
that was just my friends, Howard and Raj.

06:43.470 --> 06:45.650
All right, it's time for a very special guest caller,

06:45.650 --> 06:47.340
a friend of mine, who you probably know

06:47.340 --> 06:49.410
as the director of such movies as Clerks,

06:49.410 --> 06:51.750
or from podcasts and books where he often reminds you that

06:51.750 --> 06:54.370
he's the guy who directed Clerks.

06:54.370 --> 06:55.630
Hello, Kevin Smith.

06:55.630 --> 06:58.030
Hey, man, yo, is everything okay, Wil?

06:58.030 --> 06:59.560
'Cause it's been, like, two minutes

06:59.560 --> 07:03.130
and you haven't even brought up Stand By Me.

07:04.090 --> 07:04.880
Hey, Kevin!

07:04.880 --> 07:06.560
It's really exciting to talk to you.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.710
It really is.

07:07.710 --> 07:09.820
Oh, you guys are very sweet. So, Penny, listen,

07:09.820 --> 07:11.290
I saw your movie.

07:11.290 --> 07:13.250
Oh, wow. I wish it was better.

07:13.250 --> 07:14.200
Oh, don't worry about it.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.630
Have you seen some of Kevin's films?

07:17.490 --> 07:20.060
You're cruisin' for a beatin', Wheaton.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.810
Anyway, man, I dug the ape movie, Penny.

07:23.810 --> 07:25.770
And I thought you were, like, really great in it.

07:26.610 --> 07:27.730
You know, I'm in the movie, too.

07:27.730 --> 07:29.740
Yeah, whatever. Penny!

07:30.730 --> 07:32.760
Penny, how come you're not in more stuff, man?

07:32.760 --> 07:34.210
I'd cast you in a minute.

07:34.210 --> 07:35.260
Seriously?

07:35.260 --> 07:35.980
Oh, yeah, man.

07:35.980 --> 07:38.410
I'm actually in pre-production on a movie right now.

07:38.410 --> 07:40.760
Way different than anything I've ever done before.

07:40.760 --> 07:43.460
It's called Clerks 3.

07:43.990 --> 07:45.940
You should come over and read for a part.

07:45.940 --> 07:48.190
Oh, my, I would love that.

07:48.190 --> 07:49.740
You have a new job.

07:50.270 --> 07:51.560
Well, maybe I can do both.

07:51.560 --> 07:53.600
I don't think you can do both.

07:54.020 --> 07:56.330
I don't think I asked you.

07:56.330 --> 07:58.320
Yeah, you tell him, Penny.

07:59.490 --> 08:01.680
Stay out of it, Kevin Smith.

08:03.950 --> 08:05.890
Do you think there comes a point in life

08:05.890 --> 08:09.380
when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?

08:09.380 --> 08:10.940
Probably not.

08:10.940 --> 08:15.190
It's an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities.

08:15.190 --> 08:16.340
You know what?

08:16.340 --> 08:18.330
I used to be a fan of evolution,

08:18.330 --> 08:19.810
but I've since evolved,

08:19.810 --> 08:22.080
and now I think it's dumb.

08:23.530 --> 08:25.400
Being left out is a terrible feeling.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.800
No one understands that better than I do.

08:28.090 --> 08:29.880
Hey, look at that.

08:29.880 --> 08:33.240
Even in your example, you're all by yourself.

08:34.470 --> 08:36.600
When there was a lice epidemic at my school,

08:36.600 --> 08:38.460
everybody got it except me.

08:38.460 --> 08:41.110
I tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair,

08:41.110 --> 08:43.880
but I just got attacked by bees.

08:45.400 --> 08:49.010
I can just picture them all right now at Feynman's house,

08:49.010 --> 08:51.440
probably discussing Schrodinger

08:51.440 --> 08:54.870
and at the same time, not discussing Schrodinger.

08:54.870 --> 08:56.200
See?

08:56.200 --> 08:59.290
They're missing out on hilarious jokes like that.

09:00.080 --> 09:02.660
And at the same time, not.

09:03.550 --> 09:05.780
It reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister

09:05.780 --> 09:07.500
would build forts in the living room

09:07.500 --> 09:08.960
and wouldn't let me in.

09:08.960 --> 09:11.280
I hated that so much.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.200
You know,

09:13.910 --> 09:16.820
there's nothing I can do about getting you invited to the symposium,

09:16.820 --> 09:18.900
but if you wanted...

09:19.510 --> 09:21.660
we could build a fort.

09:22.180 --> 09:24.450
Isn't that a little juvenile?

09:24.450 --> 09:26.690
More juvenile than this?

09:30.080 --> 09:30.910
I'll get the blankets.

09:30.910 --> 09:33.470
You Google how to have childlike fun.

09:36.050 --> 09:37.760
You know what, I'm being a bad host.

09:37.760 --> 09:39.000
Let me get some more coffee.

09:39.000 --> 09:39.730
Oh, let me do it, Howard.

09:39.730 --> 09:41.360
No, I got it.

09:43.760 --> 09:45.340
So, Josh, what do you do?

09:45.340 --> 09:47.640
I'm studying oceanography down in San Diego.

09:47.640 --> 09:49.420
Oh, how nice.

09:53.990 --> 09:56.670
I loved Finding Nemo.

09:57.060 --> 09:58.130
Enough chitchat.

09:58.130 --> 10:00.570
How do we know you are who you say you are?

10:01.350 --> 10:02.860
Why would I lie?

10:02.860 --> 10:05.370
Okay, you got me there.

10:06.430 --> 10:07.540
You here looking for money?

10:07.540 --> 10:08.350
No.

10:08.350 --> 10:11.090
A kidney, cornea, piece of his liver?

10:11.090 --> 10:12.360
No.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.270
You're in a Beatles cover band

10:14.270 --> 10:18.040
and you need Howard to replace your dad as Ringo.

10:19.330 --> 10:20.970
Why don't you help with the coffee?

10:20.970 --> 10:23.840
Okay, but something smells fishy.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.640
And not just because you work around sea animals.

10:26.640 --> 10:27.800
That actually sounds interesting,

10:27.800 --> 10:29.880
and I'd like to learn more about it.

10:33.150 --> 10:34.460
Hey, you okay?

10:34.460 --> 10:35.620
Not really.

10:35.620 --> 10:38.090
This guy shows up out of the blue,

10:38.090 --> 10:39.920
and now I have a brother?

10:39.920 --> 10:43.590
My father has another family?

10:43.590 --> 10:45.010
I get it.

10:45.370 --> 10:46.590
What do you want to do?

10:46.590 --> 10:48.020
I don't know. I...

10:48.490 --> 10:50.400
I'd just like him to go away.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.340
I can't deal with this.

10:52.340 --> 10:54.680
All right, I've got your back.

10:54.980 --> 10:56.620
Thank you. Come on.

10:58.730 --> 10:59.540
And I'd like to point out

10:59.540 --> 11:02.480
this wall just provided a lot of privacy!

11:03.890 --> 11:05.480
I can't believe my brother's an astronaut.

11:05.480 --> 11:07.150
That's amazing. What was it like?

11:07.150 --> 11:07.810
Listen, dude,

11:07.810 --> 11:08.830
it's time for you to hit the road.

11:08.830 --> 11:12.080
Hey, hey, the young man asked a good question.

11:17.700 --> 11:19.180
So, for those of you just tuning in,

11:19.180 --> 11:21.540
we are listening to a really fun fight

11:21.540 --> 11:22.830
- between my costar... - No, no, no.

11:22.830 --> 11:23.790
We're not fighting; we're just...

11:23.790 --> 11:25.970
having a conversation.

11:26.460 --> 11:27.560
All right.

11:27.560 --> 11:30.220
We're listening to a really fun conversation

11:30.220 --> 11:32.890
between my costar from Serial Ape-ist 2

11:32.890 --> 11:37.340
and her fiance, who doesn't believe women should have dreams.

11:39.730 --> 11:41.350
Give me back that juice.

11:43.700 --> 11:45.190
What is the harm if I audition?

11:45.190 --> 11:46.510
Well, what if you get it?

11:46.510 --> 11:48.720
I don't know, I make a movie,

11:48.720 --> 11:50.060
become rich and famous,

11:50.060 --> 11:51.600
win an Oscar, a Golden Globe

11:51.600 --> 11:53.920
and live an incredibly wonderful life.

11:53.920 --> 11:56.430
From a Kevin Smith movie?

11:57.020 --> 11:59.150
Oh, I'm hanging up now.

11:59.960 --> 12:01.030
Don't you listen to him, buddy.

12:01.030 --> 12:01.850
You're awesome.

12:01.850 --> 12:03.820
You're one of the greatest directors of our time.

12:03.820 --> 12:06.110
I don't have a part for you, Wheaton.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.980
And that was Kevin Smith.

12:10.740 --> 12:11.610
Thanks a lot.

12:11.610 --> 12:13.880
I'm just trying to protect you.

12:14.140 --> 12:16.020
How many times did I see you get your heart broken

12:16.020 --> 12:17.510
trying to make it as an actress?

12:17.510 --> 12:19.110
Okay, instead of protecting me, why don't you try

12:19.110 --> 12:20.980
being excited when something good happens?

12:20.980 --> 12:23.480
I'm always excited for you!

12:23.480 --> 12:25.080
I'm excited that you found this new job

12:25.080 --> 12:26.820
where you're making decent money.

12:26.820 --> 12:28.750
Decent? I make twice what you make.

12:28.750 --> 12:30.460
Wait, twice?!

12:30.460 --> 12:32.040
Yeah.

12:32.920 --> 12:36.890
Like, "times two" twice?

12:36.890 --> 12:38.630
For those of you at home, Leonard just found out

12:38.630 --> 12:42.330
his fiance makes way more money than he does.

12:42.330 --> 12:44.590
Let's listen.

12:44.590 --> 12:46.780
I went to school for half my life.

12:46.780 --> 12:47.640
I have a doctorate.

12:47.640 --> 12:50.210
I'm still paying off college loans.

12:50.210 --> 12:51.300
Well, how much do you owe?

12:51.300 --> 12:53.650
Maybe I can help you out.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.780
Wil, can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit?

12:58.780 --> 12:59.880
For those of you at home,

12:59.880 --> 13:02.510
I am shaking my head "no".

13:09.860 --> 13:11.450
How's it going, Sheldon?

13:11.450 --> 13:13.240
Wonderful!

13:14.860 --> 13:17.080
I just finished hanging the lights.

13:17.080 --> 13:17.980
Can I come in?

13:17.980 --> 13:19.840
Yes, oh, but enter through the side.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.570
Batman is a load-bearing blanket.

13:28.100 --> 13:29.560
Amazing.

13:29.560 --> 13:30.810
I know.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.290
This isn't the printout.

13:32.290 --> 13:34.560
This is my real face.

13:35.900 --> 13:37.000
What are we doing?

13:37.000 --> 13:38.080
This is a fort.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.790
Let's sit on the floor.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.950
Roughing it? Okay.

13:46.800 --> 13:49.930
Everything looks so big from down here.

13:51.380 --> 13:54.630
This must be how Leonard feels.

13:57.550 --> 13:59.070
I'm surprised you could hear me

13:59.070 --> 14:01.600
with this Thin Mint in your ear!

14:02.930 --> 14:04.190
Yeah, pretty cool, huh?

14:04.190 --> 14:05.670
Yeah.

14:06.350 --> 14:08.660
Anyway, I should probably get going.

14:09.470 --> 14:11.340
Howie, have you noticed how often people say that

14:11.340 --> 14:13.510
when you start to do magic?

14:14.630 --> 14:16.740
Sorry, I have a long drive.

14:16.780 --> 14:19.740
Well, I hope I get to see you again.

14:20.090 --> 14:21.530
I hope so, too.

14:21.530 --> 14:24.930
I've always dreamed of having a brother to play catch with.

14:25.590 --> 14:27.390
Keep dreaming.

14:28.180 --> 14:30.510
Hey, I threw out the first pitch at an Angels game.

14:31.270 --> 14:33.820
He did it with a robot.

14:34.870 --> 14:37.550
You had sex with a robot?

14:38.390 --> 14:39.710
That's not what she meant.

14:39.710 --> 14:41.780
But technically, yes.

14:44.200 --> 14:46.210
Hang on, if you're making all this money,

14:46.210 --> 14:47.200
where is it?

14:47.200 --> 14:48.430
In a safe place.

14:48.430 --> 14:50.060
What does that mean, under your bed?

14:50.060 --> 14:53.830
No, it means a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.

14:53.830 --> 14:55.000
I'm not overly conservative.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.730
I'm young, so my guy said I can afford to take some risks.

14:59.220 --> 15:01.490
Wait a minute, you have "a guy"?

15:01.490 --> 15:02.740
Don't you have a guy?

15:02.740 --> 15:05.600
Why would I have a guy? I don't have any money!

15:06.940 --> 15:07.850
Oh, sweetie,

15:07.850 --> 15:10.170
you should really get some money.

15:10.810 --> 15:12.500
For those of you listening at home,

15:12.500 --> 15:15.470
how great is this?

15:15.940 --> 15:18.410
Wil, I'm begging you, just please turn that off.

15:18.410 --> 15:19.940
Sure.

15:21.260 --> 15:23.950
And we're back.

15:24.450 --> 15:26.480
Leonard, why are you making such a big deal out of this?

15:26.480 --> 15:29.050
So our roles have changed a bit over the last couple years.

15:29.050 --> 15:30.530
This is the way life is.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.360
And I'm sure in time they'll change again.

15:33.360 --> 15:36.010
Great, you're not only more successful than me,

15:36.010 --> 15:38.210
now you're more mature.

15:38.560 --> 15:40.340
Okay, look, would it make you feel better

15:40.340 --> 15:43.730
if I did something dumb like sneak out of work one day

15:43.730 --> 15:46.220
to go audition for a Kevin Smith movie?

15:46.220 --> 15:48.550
That would be great, thank you!

15:49.620 --> 15:51.210
I'm just gonna jump in here real quick.

15:51.210 --> 15:52.790
Leonard, a moment ago,

15:52.790 --> 15:55.760
you were dead set against Penny resuming her acting career,

15:55.760 --> 15:57.250
but now you're all for it.

15:57.250 --> 16:00.730
Is it fair to say that she played you like a violin?

16:02.040 --> 16:04.070
Yes, it is, Wil.

16:07.030 --> 16:09.350
So, I have to ask,

16:09.350 --> 16:11.600
was the robot sexy?

16:12.150 --> 16:16.350
It was actually just a mechanical hand.

16:16.770 --> 16:18.980
'Cause that's all you need, right?

16:20.520 --> 16:22.390
You are my brother.

16:24.230 --> 16:26.700
Okay, so the final four forts

16:26.700 --> 16:29.640
in the first annual best fort ever contest,

16:29.640 --> 16:31.470
or "Fort off," are...

16:32.430 --> 16:33.710
...Fort Knox,

16:33.710 --> 16:35.350
Fort Ticonderoga,

16:35.350 --> 16:37.810
Fort Sumter and...

16:37.810 --> 16:40.190
Fort Cozy McBlanket.

16:41.460 --> 16:42.620
I'd say...

16:42.620 --> 16:44.530
Knox over Ticonderoga

16:44.530 --> 16:45.840
'cause it's got the gold.

16:45.840 --> 16:47.920
And McBlanket over Sumter

16:47.920 --> 16:50.060
'cause it has a higher thread count.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.330
10:00.

16:55.800 --> 16:56.890
Date night's over.

16:56.890 --> 16:58.120
Wait, no.

16:58.120 --> 17:00.030
We haven't picked a winner.

17:00.030 --> 17:02.140
We both know this one's gonna win.

17:02.140 --> 17:03.850
Well, of course we do.

17:03.850 --> 17:08.010
Fort Knox doesn't have a secret physics lending library.

17:09.540 --> 17:11.400
Come on, I'll help you take this down.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.220
Well, wait.

17:12.220 --> 17:14.340
What if, just this once,

17:14.340 --> 17:16.690
we suspend the date night parameters

17:16.690 --> 17:18.990
and you stay later?

17:20.870 --> 17:24.400
Well, as long as we're suspending the parameters,

17:25.300 --> 17:26.680
I could stay really late

17:26.680 --> 17:29.630
and we could have our first sleepover.

17:30.910 --> 17:32.880
That's a big step.

17:32.880 --> 17:35.020
It's a big fort.

17:37.900 --> 17:38.840
Very well.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.900
I will agree to a family-friendly,

17:41.900 --> 17:45.410
G-rated, boy-girl sleepover.

17:47.030 --> 17:47.770
Pg.

17:47.770 --> 17:51.360
Some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers.

17:52.220 --> 17:53.530
G-rated,

17:53.530 --> 17:57.350
with a warning for families with babies and toddlers.

17:59.110 --> 18:01.020
You got yourself a sleepover.

18:02.120 --> 18:04.930
Do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas?

18:04.930 --> 18:06.670
Would it alarm you to know

18:06.670 --> 18:09.180
that I hid those things here two years ago

18:09.180 --> 18:11.590
just in case this ever came up?

18:14.350 --> 18:14.930
It would,

18:14.930 --> 18:17.710
but you know how much I admire preparedness.

18:19.130 --> 18:21.430
How did you know we'd be in the living room?

18:21.430 --> 18:24.070
Who says this is the only one I hid?

18:34.770 --> 18:36.840
Hello? What is this?

18:36.840 --> 18:38.770
We built a fort!

18:40.300 --> 18:41.540
Are those my sheets?

18:41.540 --> 18:43.230
Yes, they are.

18:44.330 --> 18:45.210
Okay.

18:45.210 --> 18:47.280
Well, you kids have fun.

18:47.280 --> 18:48.220
I'm gonna go to sleep.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.790
Leonard, don't you want to see the inside of the fort?

18:50.790 --> 18:51.860
Yeah, I'm good.

18:51.860 --> 18:53.170
Oh, come on.

18:53.170 --> 18:55.710
I really wanted to tell someone they can't come in.

18:56.710 --> 18:57.860
Okay, fine.

18:57.860 --> 19:01.230
Sheldon, may I please visit your fort?

19:01.230 --> 19:02.120
I want to say no,

19:02.120 --> 19:04.450
but it's too glorious. Get in here!

19:06.320 --> 19:08.050
Thank you.

19:08.050 --> 19:09.890
Okay, have a seat on the floor.

19:09.890 --> 19:12.380
Not there. That's my spot.
