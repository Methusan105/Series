WEBVTT

00:04.930 --> 00:06.500
Okay, we're headed out... See you later.

00:06.500 --> 00:07.660
Before you leave,

00:07.660 --> 00:10.230
could you test these noise-cancelling headphones?

00:10.230 --> 00:11.490
Yeah, sure. Okay.

00:14.110 --> 00:15.380
Go ahead.

00:15.380 --> 00:17.510
Hello, can you hear me?

00:21.250 --> 00:22.800
Sheldon, I haven't changed the filter

00:22.800 --> 00:25.450
in the water pitcher in two years.

00:27.190 --> 00:31.280
Uh, Bernadette's nickname for you is the virgin pina colada.

00:35.480 --> 00:39.360
Your George Lucas autograph is really a "me" autograph.

00:41.070 --> 00:43.770
Yeah, well, once I was too lazy to walk across the hall,

00:43.770 --> 00:46.060
so I used your toothbrush.

00:48.490 --> 00:50.160
Ooh, and one time when you were asleep,

00:50.160 --> 00:51.590
Amy totally took off her...

00:51.590 --> 00:54.020
And that's why you're the best roommate ever.

00:57.170 --> 00:59.340
Now I'm sad I didn't hear it.

01:00.120 --> 01:01.820
So what do you need the headphones for?

01:01.820 --> 01:03.400
Well, I've been struggling for months

01:03.400 --> 01:05.170
to come up with a theory of dark matter

01:05.170 --> 01:06.900
that doesn't make protons decay.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.450
I'm hoping to finally tackle it

01:08.450 --> 01:10.560
by optimizing my work environment.

01:10.560 --> 01:15.290
See, I've got, uh, my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature.

01:15.300 --> 01:17.750
Uh, I have fleece-lined boxer shorts

01:17.750 --> 01:19.320
to keep my tushie toasty.

01:19.410 --> 01:21.410
And then, oh, last but not least,

01:21.410 --> 01:23.570
this inspirational cat poster,

01:23.570 --> 01:25.800
improved with the reassuring face

01:25.800 --> 01:28.140
of physics renegade Richard Feynman.

01:31.160 --> 01:34.010
Is that why you had to take him to Office Depot last night?

01:34.010 --> 01:36.110
I don't want to talk about it.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.080
There, the place is all yours.

01:38.080 --> 01:38.930
Yeah, have fun.

01:38.930 --> 01:40.860
Oh, I will-- nothing more fun

01:40.860 --> 01:43.220
than a paradigm-shifting evening of science.

01:43.650 --> 01:46.320
And you thought it was soaping me up in the shower.

01:47.480 --> 01:48.370
Bye.

01:48.940 --> 01:50.630
Okay.

01:51.940 --> 01:53.650
Here we go.

01:55.460 --> 01:56.890
Proton decay.

01:58.150 --> 01:59.490
Proton decay.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.080
Proton decay.

02:03.650 --> 02:04.870
Proton decay.

02:06.700 --> 02:08.010
Proton decay.

02:09.780 --> 02:11.050
Proton decay.

02:11.490 --> 02:12.500
Hey, we're home.

02:16.030 --> 02:17.020
Any progress?

02:17.020 --> 02:18.050
How could there be?!

02:18.050 --> 02:20.160
With these constant interruptions.

02:22.510 --> 02:25.690
I love him, but if he's broken, let's not get a new one.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.070
What are you doing? It's time to go.

02:57.150 --> 02:59.030
I'm not going to work today.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.110
And would you like to know why?

03:02.280 --> 03:04.030
Ah, you're upset because you spent the whole night working

03:04.030 --> 03:05.820
on dark matter and didn't make a breakthrough,

03:05.820 --> 03:08.000
and now you're worried you made a huge mistake switching fields,

03:08.000 --> 03:09.890
and you're gonna sit around and sulk all day?

03:10.440 --> 03:12.340
Like a big old baby.

03:14.220 --> 03:16.430
Call me if you need anything.

03:20.010 --> 03:22.680
I've been cooped up in here too long.

03:22.740 --> 03:24.390
Maybe I need some fresh air.

03:44.180 --> 03:45.060
Penny?

03:46.370 --> 03:47.230
Penny?

03:48.240 --> 03:49.100
Penny?

03:51.640 --> 03:52.870
Ugh, what?

03:52.940 --> 03:54.770
You sounded in distress.

03:54.780 --> 03:57.380
I was worried something unpleasant was happening to you.

03:57.380 --> 03:58.750
Like a murder.

03:58.830 --> 04:01.180
Or spontaneous coitus with Leonard.

04:03.490 --> 04:06.390
Oh, I'm just doing this awful workout. I hate it.

04:06.390 --> 04:08.910
Well, if you hate it, then why are you doing it?

04:08.910 --> 04:10.210
Although I could ask the same question

04:10.210 --> 04:11.740
about coitus with Leonard.

04:13.480 --> 04:14.970
I don't know-- I guess I like that I hate it.

04:14.970 --> 04:16.350
It makes me work harder.

04:17.400 --> 04:20.120
- And to clarify... - The exercise, Sheldon.

04:21.830 --> 04:23.610
Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?

04:23.720 --> 04:25.010
I'm not going.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.690
Would you like to know why?

04:26.920 --> 04:29.520
Uh, you're sad about not getting anything done last night,

04:29.520 --> 04:31.420
so you're gonna sit around and pout about it?

04:32.390 --> 04:35.150
Boy, I'm not nearly as mysterious as I think I am.

04:37.900 --> 04:40.140
- I invented a game. You want to play? - Sure.

04:40.370 --> 04:42.340
It's called "Emily or Cinnamon""

04:42.790 --> 04:45.900
I give you actual quotes I've heard Raj say,

04:45.900 --> 04:50.320
and you guess if he was talking to his girlfriend or his dog.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.800
Go ahead, make fun.

04:55.800 --> 04:56.980
You can't embarrass me.

04:56.980 --> 04:58.480
I've got a beautiful girlfriend

04:58.480 --> 05:01.160
and a dog who loves me so much she drinks my bathwater.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.570
Okay, who was he talking to, Emily or Cinnamon:

05:06.890 --> 05:09.810
"I want you to know, the bed feels so lonely

05:09.820 --> 05:11.210
when you're not in it."

05:17.580 --> 05:19.670
I may not be liking this game so much.

05:21.220 --> 05:22.990
Cinnamon. Give me another one.

05:23.450 --> 05:25.190
Okay, Emily or Cinnamon:

05:25.190 --> 05:27.660
"Check it out, I got us matching sweaters!"

05:27.660 --> 05:29.670
We all got the Christmas card-- Cinnamon.

05:31.150 --> 05:34.740
You know, a man can care deeply about a woman and a pet.

05:34.740 --> 05:35.920
It's not strange.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.820
Ooh, Emily. I heard him say that to Emily.

05:39.950 --> 05:41.340
Hey, I thought you were staying home.

05:41.340 --> 05:44.180
Yeah, I was, but after talking to Penny,

05:44.180 --> 05:45.620
I realized something.

05:45.620 --> 05:49.450
I... first, she's trying much harder to stay attractive

05:49.450 --> 05:51.250
in this relationship than you are.

05:55.650 --> 05:56.890
And second...

05:57.210 --> 06:00.030
the reason I may not be progressing in my research is

06:00.070 --> 06:03.380
I've created too pleasant of an environment for myself.

06:03.830 --> 06:04.870
What do you mean?

06:04.900 --> 06:07.550
According to a classic psychological experiment

06:07.550 --> 06:11.030
by Yerkes and Dodson, in order to maximize performance,

06:11.030 --> 06:14.260
one must create a state of productive anxiety.

06:14.260 --> 06:17.740
So I'd like to ask you all to do something for me.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.730
Keep me on my toes.

06:19.730 --> 06:21.780
Just throw me off my game.

06:21.800 --> 06:26.180
E-Essentially, go out of your way to make my life miserable.

06:29.320 --> 06:30.130
Hold on.

06:30.260 --> 06:31.840
What's in it for us?

06:32.180 --> 06:33.990
- Well, I suppose... - Okay, we'll do it!

06:42.650 --> 06:43.870
Done.

06:43.870 --> 06:45.580
33 seconds.

06:45.580 --> 06:48.000
Okay, that'll be our baseline.

06:48.520 --> 06:50.040
You know, I don't want to tell you how to do your job,

06:50.040 --> 06:51.510
but when a mouse completes a maze,

06:51.510 --> 06:53.410
it gets a food pellet.

06:53.910 --> 06:57.190
It also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers.

06:57.920 --> 07:00.170
And his last meal was a food pellet?

07:00.660 --> 07:02.320
You're a monster.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.510
All right, next, we're gonna introduce

07:05.510 --> 07:08.540
an anxiety-inducing stimulus, measure your stress levels

07:08.540 --> 07:10.380
and see how it affects your problem-solving rate.

07:10.380 --> 07:11.190
Very well.

07:11.190 --> 07:14.570
And good luck-- I'm a pretty laid-back guy.

07:16.340 --> 07:17.520
Ready?

07:17.520 --> 07:18.550
Begin.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.390
Why'd you pop it?

07:42.390 --> 07:44.570
I'm sorry, I was aiming for your heart.

07:48.280 --> 07:49.350
Look, I know you don't like it,

07:49.350 --> 07:51.170
but that's the point of the experiment.

07:51.170 --> 07:52.460
I need to irritate you

07:52.460 --> 07:54.680
to find your optimal anxiety zone.

07:54.830 --> 07:58.780
And you said no to tickling, polka music or watching me eat a banana.

07:59.850 --> 08:01.850
Who eats them horizontally?!

08:04.050 --> 08:05.950
My mother said that's how good girls do it.

08:10.210 --> 08:12.200
Perhaps this was a waste of time.

08:12.500 --> 08:13.470
Sheldon,

08:13.720 --> 08:15.590
you're a remarkable scientist.

08:15.590 --> 08:18.280
Just be patient-- I'm sure you'll find the breakthrough

08:18.280 --> 08:19.550
you've been looking for.

08:19.560 --> 08:20.430
Thank you.

08:20.460 --> 08:22.720
And if you only do solid research

08:22.730 --> 08:25.330
instead of making a groundbreaking discovery,

08:25.810 --> 08:27.280
what does it matter?

08:27.330 --> 08:29.420
"Only do solid research"?!

08:29.420 --> 08:33.300
Uh... I come to you for help, and you insult me?!

08:33.300 --> 08:34.090
I thought the least that you would do would be...

08:34.090 --> 08:36.620
Look, your anxiety levels are right in the zone.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.060
Really?

08:38.060 --> 08:39.700
Oh, that's fantastic.

08:39.700 --> 08:41.100
N-Now, wait, they're dropping.

08:41.100 --> 08:42.020
Why are they dropping?

08:42.020 --> 08:43.760
Because you're happy they're elevated.

08:43.760 --> 08:45.740
Oh, that is infuriating!

08:45.740 --> 08:47.300
Ooh, look, they went back up again.

08:47.300 --> 08:48.080
Terrific.

08:48.080 --> 08:49.730
Oh, no, they went back down!

08:52.470 --> 08:56.170
All right, guys, what game do you want to play?

08:56.570 --> 08:57.660
Let's see.

08:57.660 --> 09:00.580
How about "Emily or Cinnamon""

09:02.530 --> 09:03.980
You know what? I think it's a little weird

09:03.980 --> 09:05.910
that you remember me saying all these things.

09:05.910 --> 09:09.000
Maybe the truth is-- you're jealous of all my relationships.

09:10.520 --> 09:12.360
Oh, maybe I am.

09:12.770 --> 09:14.030
Who wouldn't want to be the girl,

09:14.030 --> 09:16.420
or possibly dog, to hear the words:

09:17.520 --> 09:18.720
"You're so lucky.

09:18.720 --> 09:21.040
You have the shiniest hair""

09:24.910 --> 09:26.480
That is a tough one.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.750
Uh, I-I know he brushes both of them.

09:31.030 --> 09:32.330
- Gentlemen... - Yeah.

09:32.470 --> 09:36.040
I have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.760
I'd like you to be my intellectual sparring partners.

09:39.760 --> 09:42.490
From now on, when I make an assertion,

09:42.490 --> 09:44.140
I need you to challenge it.

09:44.390 --> 09:47.620
So you just want us to disagree with whatever you say?

09:47.640 --> 09:48.480
Yes.

09:48.700 --> 09:51.370
- And you think that's going to help? - Yes.

09:52.380 --> 09:54.240
Well, I don't think that's gonna help at all.

09:54.570 --> 09:55.410
Oh, no, it will.

09:55.410 --> 09:59.130
See, by keeping my mind engaged, I'll become more focused.

09:59.130 --> 10:01.010
Howard's right-- that'll never work.

10:01.710 --> 10:04.450
Stop fighting me on the premise. It's scientifically valid.

10:04.450 --> 10:06.190
I'm going to advance propositions,

10:06.190 --> 10:07.750
I just want you to challenge me.

10:07.750 --> 10:10.330
I don't think that's what you want at all.

10:12.380 --> 10:13.870
Why, of course it's what I want.

10:13.870 --> 10:15.960
Why would I say it's what I want if it's not what I want?

10:15.960 --> 10:18.170
Because it is what you want, and it's not what you said.

10:20.740 --> 10:23.550
I ask you for one simple thing, and you can't even do it.

10:23.550 --> 10:24.390
Yes, we can.

10:24.390 --> 10:26.070
- Yeah, well, then do it. - Nah.

10:27.680 --> 10:29.290
You guys are the worst.

10:32.250 --> 10:34.360
Thank you, I think that was helpful.

10:38.940 --> 10:41.400
Whichever rep has the best sales for the quarter

10:41.400 --> 10:43.450
gets a trip for two to Hawaii.

10:43.450 --> 10:45.820
That would be so romantic for you and Leonard.

10:45.820 --> 10:47.900
Yeah, clearly you haven't seen him on the beach

10:47.900 --> 10:50.600
walking around with his metal detector.

10:51.550 --> 10:52.630
If I were going to Hawaii,

10:52.630 --> 10:55.070
I'd spend all my time at the Keck Observatory.

10:55.070 --> 10:56.490
Did you know that the telescopes there

10:56.490 --> 10:58.340
have better resolution than the Hubble?

10:58.390 --> 10:59.350
Really?

10:59.850 --> 11:01.130
Want to go to Hawaii?

11:03.710 --> 11:04.730
Ladies?

11:05.090 --> 11:06.120
Ladies...

11:06.480 --> 11:07.370
Ladies?

11:07.370 --> 11:08.350
Come in.

11:09.700 --> 11:10.710
Ladies.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.080
What's up?

11:12.310 --> 11:15.040
As you may know, I've been experimenting

11:15.040 --> 11:16.790
with elevated anxiety levels,

11:16.790 --> 11:17.820
and I thought,

11:17.820 --> 11:20.110
what better way to increase my discomfort

11:20.110 --> 11:21.760
than to subject myself to an evening

11:21.760 --> 11:24.450
of tasteless uncensored crotch talk?

11:27.250 --> 11:30.020
What exactly do you think goes on here?

11:30.600 --> 11:31.310
Well...

11:31.310 --> 11:33.150
conversations that you wouldn't be comfortable having

11:33.150 --> 11:34.880
in front of the opposite sex.

11:34.880 --> 11:38.030
You know, who has the best cervix.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.470
Which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now.

11:41.450 --> 11:44.470
Men's buttocks, and how you want to pat and squeeze them.

11:46.920 --> 11:48.550
We were talking about Penny's job.

11:49.300 --> 11:50.560
And how difficult it is to do

11:50.560 --> 11:52.300
when she's bloated, cranky and crampy?

11:52.300 --> 11:53.150
Continue.

11:56.390 --> 11:58.210
Sheldon, we are just people.

11:58.210 --> 12:00.620
We talk about the same things you guys talk about.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.860
You talk about if werewolves can swim?

12:04.040 --> 12:05.590
See, Leonard says yes,

12:05.590 --> 12:07.630
but I say it depends on if the human could swim

12:07.630 --> 12:09.490
before he was bitten. What do you think?

12:11.150 --> 12:13.000
Let's just talk about our periods.

12:15.040 --> 12:16.060
No, hold on.

12:16.180 --> 12:19.050
All canines instinctively know how to swim.

12:19.050 --> 12:21.790
Why wouldn't a werewolf have the same abilities?

12:22.070 --> 12:24.410
Well, they're not a hundred percent wolf.

12:24.410 --> 12:27.190
They're a werewolf-- that's only part wolf.

12:27.190 --> 12:29.030
It's like comparing apples to oranges.

12:29.030 --> 12:30.320
Thank you.

12:30.840 --> 12:33.500
Oh, and technically, it's apples that turn into were-oranges

12:33.500 --> 12:34.670
when the moon is full.

12:36.640 --> 12:37.900
Hey, this is fun.

12:38.520 --> 12:40.600
We should do it sometime when you aren't all PMS'ing.

12:40.600 --> 12:41.300
Bye.

12:50.910 --> 12:52.610
What is going on?

12:53.560 --> 12:56.240
Uh, I need to keep my anxiety at the right level,

12:56.240 --> 13:00.130
so I'm using Darth Vader, the Joker, and Godzilla's roar

13:00.130 --> 13:01.810
to keep me in that sweet spot.

13:03.180 --> 13:06.080
Uh, I tried including Taylor Swift in the mix,

13:06.080 --> 13:08.250
but turns out I love her.

13:11.110 --> 13:13.500
Well, at least listen to it through headphones.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.420
I'm trying to sleep. Good night.

13:16.510 --> 13:17.710
Boy!

13:19.440 --> 13:22.740
Taylor was right-- haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.

13:25.900 --> 13:27.920
You've been working so much lately,

13:28.260 --> 13:30.240
I'm glad you didn't forget about date night.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.740
Of course.

13:33.920 --> 13:34.830
Sheldon.

13:35.020 --> 13:35.910
Yeah.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.830
Maybe you want to put the notebook away and talk to me.

13:39.900 --> 13:41.480
I can do both.

13:41.480 --> 13:44.330
No, my brain is working at optimal capacity.

13:44.330 --> 13:46.370
No, I can have a conversation with you

13:46.370 --> 13:49.820
and solve the dark matter proton decay problem at the same time.

13:51.460 --> 13:52.870
Fine. How was your day?

13:52.870 --> 13:54.350
Oh, you said it.

13:57.020 --> 13:57.910
Sheldon.

13:58.270 --> 14:00.040
Sheldon, I'm worried about you.

14:00.460 --> 14:01.420
You're not eating,

14:01.420 --> 14:03.490
you haven't slept in days,

14:03.490 --> 14:06.400
and, to be honest, that cap is starting to smell.

14:07.590 --> 14:08.600
I know.

14:08.770 --> 14:10.750
It's replaced Godzilla

14:10.760 --> 14:12.130
as my principle source of anxiety.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.590
Okay, so it's one vote Emily, one vote Cinnamon.

14:19.590 --> 14:21.830
Penny, you're the tiebreaker.

14:24.650 --> 14:25.980
Say the quote again.

14:27.040 --> 14:30.680
"It's just so perfect that we're both Libras."

14:35.590 --> 14:37.070
Wow, this is hard.

14:37.880 --> 14:38.740
I'm gonna say Cinnamon.

14:38.740 --> 14:39.500
- Yes! - Yes!

14:39.500 --> 14:40.760
Come on!

14:42.600 --> 14:44.270
That was the last one, I promise.

14:44.280 --> 14:45.200
We won't play anymore.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.310
Thank you.

14:46.540 --> 14:48.980
'Cause if she ever found out, it would hurt her feelings.

14:49.150 --> 14:50.950
Emily's feelings?

14:52.510 --> 14:53.730
Yes, Emily.

14:53.730 --> 14:55.480
- Nice! Yay! - Good job!

14:57.510 --> 14:59.350
Whatever. Where's Sheldon?

14:59.410 --> 15:00.320
Date night.

15:00.320 --> 15:02.140
Mmm, that can't be much fun for Amy.

15:02.140 --> 15:04.520
You know, at work today, he tried his first Red Bull.

15:04.530 --> 15:05.430
What happened?

15:05.430 --> 15:08.900
He chased a squirrel around the quad for a while and...

15:10.270 --> 15:11.710
...then threw up in my car.

15:13.960 --> 15:16.110
Don't you think you should make him stop all this?

15:16.280 --> 15:18.590
I don't know... he's not really hurting anybody.

15:18.590 --> 15:21.700
You didn't have to scoop vomit out of your glove compartment.

15:22.840 --> 15:24.340
He is getting a lot of work done.

15:24.340 --> 15:27.060
He had a pretty interesting take on proton decay.

15:27.060 --> 15:30.660
Wow, if he cracks that, it's a game changer, guys.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.700
It'll completely redefine our understanding

15:32.700 --> 15:34.410
of the physical universe.

15:36.160 --> 15:37.740
Hmm, it would.

15:38.300 --> 15:40.370
Okay, back to "Emily or Cinnamon""

15:42.940 --> 15:47.110
"How can such a little girl eat such a big steak""

15:51.410 --> 15:52.330
Sheldon,

15:52.580 --> 15:54.580
I want you to take that cap off.

15:55.090 --> 15:58.400
That nagging tone is helping my anxiety, yeah.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.770
But if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill,

16:00.770 --> 16:03.160
that'd really put the zip-a-dee in my doo-dah.

16:03.940 --> 16:05.910
I'm sorry, but you know we agreed

16:05.910 --> 16:07.940
not to bring work to date night.

16:07.940 --> 16:09.670
There you go, perfect.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.230
Sheldon, stop it, I'm not kidding.

16:12.230 --> 16:15.000
Take the cap off, and put the notebook away.

16:15.020 --> 16:18.230
But after months of struggling, I'm finally making progress.

16:18.230 --> 16:21.450
You don't need to drive yourself crazy in order to be productive.

16:21.450 --> 16:23.400
Or do I, hmm?

16:23.420 --> 16:25.600
Sir Isaac Newton wrote his Principia

16:25.600 --> 16:27.470
while convinced he was an armadillo.

16:28.710 --> 16:29.810
That's not true.

16:29.810 --> 16:31.540
Yeah, well, maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

16:31.540 --> 16:33.430
I have been hallucinating lately.

16:35.460 --> 16:37.240
Sheldon, this has to stop.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.870
You need to get some sleep and take care of yourself.

16:39.870 --> 16:42.960
Amy, I have gotten more done in the last few days

16:42.960 --> 16:45.020
than I have since I made the switch to dark matter.

16:45.030 --> 16:47.870
What if I stop doing this, and it all goes away?

16:48.150 --> 16:51.880
Your thoughts and ideas come from you, not from your anxiety.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.280
Hmm, perhaps.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.950
But I'm not taking the cap off.

16:55.790 --> 16:57.840
It's one thing to make yourself miserable,

16:57.840 --> 17:00.470
but you're making everyone around you miserable, too.

17:00.470 --> 17:04.270
Now, I'm telling you for the last time-- take the cap off.

17:05.580 --> 17:06.490
Really?

17:07.510 --> 17:08.940
What if I don't?

17:08.990 --> 17:12.360
And before you answer that, can I have my dessert?

17:13.950 --> 17:15.760
And then she threw me out.

17:18.630 --> 17:20.740
Me, her very own boyfriend.

17:20.900 --> 17:23.490
When all I've done is try to help humanity reach

17:23.490 --> 17:26.230
a more profound understanding of the world we live in.

17:30.100 --> 17:31.300
Yeah, well, women...

17:31.300 --> 17:32.470
what are you gonna do?

17:35.410 --> 17:38.310
I knew you'd understand, Armadillo Isaac Newton.

17:43.280 --> 17:45.280
Okay...

17:45.460 --> 17:47.230
Here we are.

17:49.410 --> 17:51.750
What are you trying to pull?

17:51.750 --> 17:54.460
The president of science isn't in here.

17:55.780 --> 17:57.880
You lie down, he'll be here in a minute.

17:59.080 --> 18:00.100
Okay.

18:00.850 --> 18:03.110
Hey, I thought you were trying to trick me.

18:06.070 --> 18:07.870
Now, you just get comfortable.

18:07.870 --> 18:10.150
No, no, comfort is the enemy.

18:10.150 --> 18:11.540
You know what's comfortable?

18:11.540 --> 18:15.550
Slippers and blankets and panda bears.

18:16.790 --> 18:20.770
Imagine a panda bear with Richard Feynman's face on it.

18:22.110 --> 18:24.730
Warm up the car, Leonard, it's poster time.

18:26.110 --> 18:26.900
Maybe in the morning.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.180
Yeah, you get some sleep.

18:28.180 --> 18:30.790
No, I don't want to go to sleep... you can't make me.

18:30.790 --> 18:31.930
You're right, we can't.

18:31.930 --> 18:33.430
Yeah, darn straight, you can't.

18:33.430 --> 18:35.020
Try to tell a grown man to go to sleep...

18:35.020 --> 18:37.940
Soft kitty

18:37.940 --> 18:40.150
Warm kitty

18:40.150 --> 18:42.140
Little ball of fur...

18:42.140 --> 18:43.800
That's not gonna work.

18:44.870 --> 18:48.560
Happy kitty, sleepy kitty

18:48.560 --> 18:49.330
Purr

18:49.340 --> 18:51.890
Purr, purr

18:55.000 --> 18:56.680
You know, he can be a lot of trouble,

18:56.680 --> 19:00.140
but when I see him lying here asleep like this,

19:00.600 --> 19:02.170
I just think...

19:03.220 --> 19:06.420
how easy it would be to hold a pillow over his face.

19:12.410 --> 19:14.130
Wow, you look like you got some rest.

19:14.130 --> 19:15.790
Oh, I'm feeling much better.

19:15.790 --> 19:18.090
And I've also been continuing to make progress

19:18.090 --> 19:20.710
without artificially raising my anxiety levels.

19:20.720 --> 19:23.210
I turned on the heat in my car and some vomit came out,

19:23.220 --> 19:25.390
so my levels-- right up there.

19:26.270 --> 19:27.070
Hey, guys.

19:27.070 --> 19:28.520
Mind if Emily joins us for lunch?

19:28.520 --> 19:29.920
- Yeah, sure. - Yeah, no problem. Of course not.

19:30.010 --> 19:33.120
So I hear you guys have been playing a little game.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.720
Well, um, we were just kidding around.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.510
Well, you may think it's funny that Raj is sweet and sensitive,

19:38.510 --> 19:40.300
but I think it's sexy.

19:44.140 --> 19:47.440
Ugh, why is there dog hair in your mouth?
