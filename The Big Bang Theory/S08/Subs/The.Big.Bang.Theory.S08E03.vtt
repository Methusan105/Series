WEBVTT

00:04.220 --> 00:05.130
So how does this game work?

00:05.130 --> 00:06.740
I just throw out like a real ball?

00:06.740 --> 00:08.860
Yep. Just nice and easy, right over the plate.

00:08.860 --> 00:10.200
All right.

00:10.990 --> 00:12.620
You suck, Wolowitz!

00:14.080 --> 00:15.130
What's that about?

00:15.130 --> 00:16.090
I'm heckling you.

00:16.090 --> 00:18.100
It's a beloved part of baseball.

00:18.980 --> 00:19.730
He's right.

00:19.730 --> 00:21.200
And given that you're probably still waiting

00:21.200 --> 00:23.090
to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade,

00:23.090 --> 00:24.920
I'm sure you do suck.

00:26.840 --> 00:28.070
Hi. What's going on?

00:28.070 --> 00:29.130
Baseball.

00:29.130 --> 00:32.360
Okay, this is not what I meant when I said go outside and play.

00:33.010 --> 00:34.060
He's practicing.

00:34.060 --> 00:35.140
For what?

00:35.140 --> 00:38.900
The Angels wanted an astronaut to throw out the first pitch,

00:38.900 --> 00:40.700
so guess who they called?

00:40.700 --> 00:42.480
What, you? Really?!

00:42.480 --> 00:45.240
Well, a lot of people who weren't available, but then me!

00:46.790 --> 00:49.010
That's so cool! Congratulations.

00:49.010 --> 00:51.230
I guess that makes you the athlete of the group.

00:51.230 --> 00:52.740
Well, not just him!

00:52.740 --> 00:54.980
May I remind you that you're talking to the

00:54.980 --> 00:57.730
seeker, beater, chaser and water boy

00:57.730 --> 01:00.540
of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team.

01:01.170 --> 01:01.810
I know.

01:01.810 --> 01:03.500
Watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick

01:03.500 --> 01:06.120
between his legs isn't something you forget.

01:07.440 --> 01:08.590
C'mon now, throw one.

01:08.590 --> 01:10.180
All right, here we go.

01:10.940 --> 01:12.690
You look like a jackass!

01:13.440 --> 01:15.380
Cut it out! You're hurting my feelings!

01:15.380 --> 01:17.570
Now you know why we're not outside.

01:44.390 --> 01:46.480
Did you enjoy my lecture?

01:46.480 --> 01:48.890
No, and neither did our waiter.

01:50.720 --> 01:52.900
Well, if you're going to serve Cornish game hen,

01:52.900 --> 01:55.480
you should either be familiar with the history of Cornwall

01:55.480 --> 01:57.330
or be prepared to learn it.

01:58.250 --> 01:59.630
It's hard to argue with that.

01:59.630 --> 02:00.520
And I know

02:00.520 --> 02:02.450
because I saw a sad man with a pepper mill

02:02.450 --> 02:04.770
desperately try and fail.

02:09.790 --> 02:10.830
Hey, how was dinner?

02:10.830 --> 02:13.200
Good, I had Cornish game hen.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.430
Oh, that poor waiter.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.700
Sheldon, how about tomorrow night we see a movie?

02:19.700 --> 02:21.590
You guys are going out two nights in a row?

02:21.590 --> 02:25.280
I missed a number of date nights while I was on my train trip,

02:25.280 --> 02:27.370
and I'm contractually obligated to make them up

02:27.370 --> 02:30.140
under the terms of the Relationship Agreement.

02:30.730 --> 02:32.330
That's so hot.

02:33.470 --> 02:36.240
It's better than hot, it's binding.

02:38.190 --> 02:39.750
If you're free tomorrow night,

02:39.750 --> 02:42.540
I'd love to have you join us on a double date.

02:43.950 --> 02:47.770
You are aware that a double date doesn't count as two dates.

02:51.050 --> 02:53.220
Well, then come or don't. I don't care.

02:57.360 --> 02:59.530
I can't believe you're sore.

02:59.720 --> 03:03.660
Hey, even professional pitchers need a rubdown after the game.

03:05.150 --> 03:06.680
But they throw an actual ball.

03:06.680 --> 03:09.230
You were throwing air at a TV.

03:11.230 --> 03:11.870
For your information,

03:11.870 --> 03:14.670
I also gave Leonard one hell of a high five.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.410
I'm kind of surprised you agreed to do this

03:17.410 --> 03:19.330
in front of a stadium full of people.

03:19.330 --> 03:21.900
They're doing Space Day and NASA asked me.

03:21.900 --> 03:23.680
I felt like I couldn't say no.

03:23.680 --> 03:24.840
Okay.

03:24.840 --> 03:26.620
Well, if you want, I could help you practice.

03:26.620 --> 03:28.520
I played a lot of softball growing up.

03:28.520 --> 03:30.480
Thank you, that would be great.

03:30.480 --> 03:31.510
Great. And while we're at it,

03:31.510 --> 03:32.500
maybe we could butch up your run

03:32.500 --> 03:34.600
for when you head out to the mound.

03:36.190 --> 03:37.990
What's wrong with the way I run?

03:37.990 --> 03:39.170
Oh, just kidding.

03:39.170 --> 03:40.530
Nothing.

03:48.890 --> 03:51.780
Sheldon, I'm surprised you'd choose to go to a pub.

03:51.780 --> 03:53.380
At our committee meeting,

03:53.380 --> 03:55.940
Amy made a motion for a picnic in a park,

03:55.940 --> 03:58.160
but I tacked so many amendments on that thing

03:58.160 --> 04:00.900
it sank like a lead balloon.

04:01.060 --> 04:02.670
I then suggested a pub.

04:02.670 --> 04:04.870
Yeah, which I was initially skeptical of

04:04.870 --> 04:08.280
until I saw online that they serve Yorkshire pudding.

04:08.660 --> 04:10.180
You don't even like Yorkshire pudding.

04:10.180 --> 04:11.280
No, it's yucky,

04:11.280 --> 04:14.070
but informing people about the history of Yorkshire

04:14.070 --> 04:15.930
is yummy, yum-yum.

04:17.160 --> 04:18.620
After a lively debate,

04:18.620 --> 04:21.570
that proposal passed by a two-zero margin.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.120
Nice to see a busy couple

04:24.120 --> 04:26.450
keep the spark of bureaucracy alive.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.450
Ignore them, Amy. They're just jealous

04:30.450 --> 04:33.760
because they'll never have a relationship as good as ours.

04:35.310 --> 04:38.090
Isn't this when he says "bazooka" or something?

04:39.160 --> 04:40.520
I wasn't making a joke,

04:40.520 --> 04:42.360
I was merely stating fact.

04:42.360 --> 04:46.360
Amy and I have a superior relationship to yours.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.580
You don't honestly think that, do you?

04:48.580 --> 04:50.110
Y... Leonard,

04:50.110 --> 04:52.450
I assumed you knew.

04:53.250 --> 04:55.410
The ranking of relationships in our circle

04:55.410 --> 04:57.790
by quality is: me and Amy,

04:57.790 --> 05:00.610
Howard and Bernadette, Raj and his girlfriend,

05:00.610 --> 05:03.800
Penny and Chardonnay, Penny and you.

05:06.170 --> 05:07.980
There isn't any ranking.

05:07.980 --> 05:10.850
And if there were, we wouldn't be at the bottom of it.

05:10.850 --> 05:14.000
Yeah, and actually, I drink Sauvignon Blanc.

05:15.660 --> 05:17.790
That's the part you have a problem with?

05:18.340 --> 05:19.600
Relax.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.660
There they go, fighting again.

05:22.450 --> 05:25.560
You'd never hear her talk that way to Sauvignon Blanc.

05:29.230 --> 05:30.970
So you never played baseball as a kid,

05:30.970 --> 05:32.850
not even Little League?

05:32.850 --> 05:34.880
Well, I was going to, but the day of tryouts

05:34.880 --> 05:37.360
I found my dad's Playboy collection.

05:39.390 --> 05:40.970
Threw my arm out.

05:43.420 --> 05:45.340
All right, the pitcher's mound in Major League Baseball

05:45.340 --> 05:47.720
is 60 feet, six inches away from home plate.

05:47.720 --> 05:49.830
Great. You take this

05:49.830 --> 05:52.170
and say when to stop.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.230
How much further?

05:59.230 --> 06:00.620
Keep going.

06:03.250 --> 06:04.270
How about now?

06:04.270 --> 06:06.140
I'll let you know.

06:09.160 --> 06:09.970
Are you saying "stop"

06:09.970 --> 06:12.340
and we're just too far away to hear you?

06:13.050 --> 06:14.760
Okay, stop.

06:18.770 --> 06:20.520
Are you kidding me?!

06:20.520 --> 06:22.120
That's 60 feet.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.530
There's no way this is 60 feet.

06:24.530 --> 06:26.440
I'm looking at it.

06:28.320 --> 06:29.570
You realize this isn't one of those times

06:29.570 --> 06:33.080
I want you to exaggerate how long something is.

06:38.390 --> 06:40.050
Okay, I got to... I-I just...

06:40.050 --> 06:41.460
I got to ask:

06:42.450 --> 06:44.260
what makes you think that your relationship

06:44.260 --> 06:46.890
is so wonderful and ours isn't?

06:47.390 --> 06:48.400
For starters,

06:48.400 --> 06:51.110
we enjoy spending time together.

06:54.450 --> 06:55.940
So do we.

06:55.940 --> 06:58.180
And I've seen you guys ignore each other for hours

06:58.180 --> 07:00.040
doing totally different things.

07:00.040 --> 07:03.850
It's called parallel play.

07:03.850 --> 07:05.610
Yeah, toddlers do that.

07:05.610 --> 07:07.160
Not as well as we do.

07:09.880 --> 07:12.060
You believe this guy? He has to be the best at everything.

07:12.060 --> 07:14.270
So what? Why do you even care?

07:14.270 --> 07:15.840
Oh, listen to them.

07:15.840 --> 07:18.710
Not even married and the honeymoon's over.

07:19.820 --> 07:21.450
Whatever. You can't even go on a date

07:21.450 --> 07:24.010
without checking your relationship agreement.

07:24.010 --> 07:27.530
If you've got a problem basing a relationship on a contract,

07:27.530 --> 07:30.830
I'd like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies

07:30.830 --> 07:32.840
that entered a "Relationship agreement"

07:32.840 --> 07:35.430
called the U.S. Constitution.

07:35.770 --> 07:37.690
And it may not be cool to say so,

07:37.690 --> 07:40.840
but I think that love affair is still pretty hot today.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.350
It's a good thing I'm not wearing flag underwear right now,

07:45.350 --> 07:48.360
'cause there's about to be a fire.

07:54.610 --> 07:56.050
Okay, it's not that hard.

07:56.050 --> 07:57.850
You just look to where you want to throw it,

07:57.850 --> 07:59.470
step towards where you want to throw,

07:59.470 --> 08:00.610
and throw it.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.120
That's your help?

08:05.120 --> 08:08.050
That's like saying, "Here's how you fly a plane:

08:08.050 --> 08:09.240
Get in the airplane,

08:09.240 --> 08:12.490
know where you want to go and fly it."

08:14.530 --> 08:16.780
Just throw the ball. Let's see what we're working with.

08:26.850 --> 08:29.020
Come on Howard, fire it in.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.240
Throw the damn ball!

09:01.900 --> 09:03.910
So when do you guys plan on getting married?

09:03.910 --> 09:06.040
Uh, we're not sure. But I want to wait long enough

09:06.040 --> 09:08.570
to prove to my mother I'm not pregnant.

09:10.420 --> 09:11.950
May I have one of your fries?

09:11.950 --> 09:13.080
Of course.

09:13.810 --> 09:15.500
Can I have a bite of your burger?

09:15.500 --> 09:17.180
Absolutely not.

09:18.990 --> 09:19.980
Some perfect couple.

09:19.980 --> 09:21.660
He won't even share his food with her.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.610
It has avocado on it.

09:23.610 --> 09:25.650
She's allergic to avocado.

09:26.130 --> 09:27.800
Are you so jealous of our relationship

09:27.800 --> 09:29.850
you want Amy to die?

09:31.890 --> 09:32.880
I'm not jealous.

09:32.880 --> 09:35.340
I just think it's silly for you to compare relationships

09:35.340 --> 09:37.770
like they're something that can be quantified.

09:37.770 --> 09:39.750
Everything is quantifiable.

09:39.750 --> 09:42.140
That French fry? A seven.

09:42.510 --> 09:44.410
Spider-Man? A nine.

09:44.410 --> 09:47.800
The number nine-- oddly, only a four.

09:48.900 --> 09:51.170
- How ridiculous is he? - A hundred.

09:54.370 --> 09:56.510
Sheldon, you're just assigning random numbers

09:56.510 --> 09:58.280
to things based on your opinion.

09:58.280 --> 09:59.560
No, I'm not.

09:59.560 --> 10:01.580
French fries have three variables--

10:01.580 --> 10:03.720
crispiness, saltiness and shape.

10:03.720 --> 10:06.310
Which is why a curly fry only gets a two.

10:06.550 --> 10:09.860
If I wanted curls for dinner, I'd order a clown wig.

10:12.100 --> 10:14.690
Well, a relationship is more complicated than a French fry.

10:14.690 --> 10:18.220
Not according to the work of Berscheid, Snyder and Omoto.

10:18.220 --> 10:20.810
Oh, what did those rascals do now?

10:22.330 --> 10:24.800
They developed the Relationship Closeness Inventory,

10:24.800 --> 10:27.510
which predicts the stability of a couple based on behavior.

10:27.510 --> 10:28.950
Yeah, not to be confused

10:28.950 --> 10:30.950
with the French Fry Goodness Inventory.

10:30.950 --> 10:32.770
That's pure Cooper.

10:34.030 --> 10:35.320
So, this is accurate?

10:35.320 --> 10:37.120
It's been around for 25 years,

10:37.120 --> 10:39.950
and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers.

10:39.950 --> 10:42.500
Well, kind of takes the romance out of relationships.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.700
Kind of? It does it perfectly.

10:46.240 --> 10:48.820
Sheldon and I got an eight-point-two out of ten.

10:49.550 --> 10:51.240
Fine. We'll take it right now.

10:51.920 --> 10:53.270
- No, don't. - What?

10:53.270 --> 10:54.790
- Just don't take it. - Why not?

10:54.790 --> 10:56.530
'Cause it's stupid. Who cares what number it is?

10:56.620 --> 10:57.680
Come on. It'll be fun.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.600
I said I don't want you to.

11:00.900 --> 11:02.340
I'm getting another drink.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.480
Sorry.

11:09.310 --> 11:10.680
I'm gonna let you count this as two dates.

11:10.680 --> 11:12.440
They're a lot of work.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.960
Think he's getting any better?

11:23.490 --> 11:24.360
Yup.

11:25.730 --> 11:27.390
That was a close one!

11:27.390 --> 11:28.720
Okay!

11:30.460 --> 11:32.020
Is it too late for him to cancel?

11:32.020 --> 11:33.610
I think so.

11:38.690 --> 11:40.790
Heads up! Watch out!

11:48.850 --> 11:49.940
Are you mad at me?

11:49.940 --> 11:52.270
No, stop being stupid.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.890
Um... whew?

11:57.280 --> 11:59.840
Is this about the test, or is this about us?

11:59.840 --> 12:00.960
Look, I don't need a score on a test

12:00.960 --> 12:03.230
to make me worry about something I'm already worried about.

12:03.230 --> 12:04.660
What are you worried about?

12:05.450 --> 12:07.860
That we're engaged and have nothing in common,

12:07.860 --> 12:09.780
and it scares me.

12:11.010 --> 12:13.130
Yeah, that scares me, too.

12:13.130 --> 12:14.240
It does?

12:14.240 --> 12:15.750
Sometimes.

12:15.750 --> 12:17.860
Well, that's not good!

12:19.580 --> 12:21.960
You being blindly infatuated with me was the rock

12:21.960 --> 12:24.220
we were building this relationship on!

12:26.030 --> 12:28.580
Okay, well, this might make you feel better.

12:28.780 --> 12:32.720
Uh, we're both scared that our marriage will be a disaster,

12:32.720 --> 12:35.460
and so, that's something that we have in common.

12:40.910 --> 12:44.170
Also, we both think I'm not funny.

12:45.510 --> 12:47.640
Huh? See, you're not laughing.

12:52.120 --> 12:54.540
Hey, Froot Loops, what's up?

12:55.390 --> 12:56.520
Hey, Mike.

12:56.520 --> 12:58.930
Listen, NASA asked me to

12:58.930 --> 13:02.130
throw out the first pitch at an Angels game.

13:02.130 --> 13:03.670
You got any advice?

13:03.670 --> 13:05.840
Yeah. Don't do it.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.160
What else you up to?

13:09.660 --> 13:11.070
Why shouldn't I do it?

13:11.070 --> 13:12.290
There's no upside.

13:12.290 --> 13:14.990
If you do well, no one cares.

13:14.990 --> 13:16.270
And if you screw up,

13:16.270 --> 13:18.590
you're an idiot on YouTube forever.

13:20.530 --> 13:22.620
But it's for a good cause.

13:22.620 --> 13:24.440
What about all the kids that'll be there?

13:24.440 --> 13:25.860
That's what I'm telling you.

13:25.860 --> 13:27.690
Kids are the worst.

13:29.170 --> 13:32.380
My own daughter tweeted I have a giant nose.

13:34.530 --> 13:36.590
Well, maybe I'll do a good job.

13:36.590 --> 13:37.680
I don't know.

13:37.680 --> 13:39.640
In space, you couldn't even toss me a pen,

13:39.640 --> 13:41.620
and that was in zero gravity.

13:43.960 --> 13:45.600
Okay, thanks for the pep talk.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.430
Anytime, Froot Loops.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.530
Give your wife a hug for me.

13:49.530 --> 13:50.730
She's so much cuter than you,

13:50.730 --> 13:52.530
I don't know how you ever got her.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.650
He's so nice.

14:01.720 --> 14:03.250
Hey, sorry about that.

14:03.700 --> 14:04.730
No, we're sorry.

14:04.730 --> 14:07.910
We never should have been comparing relationships in the first place.

14:07.910 --> 14:10.180
Why? We won.

14:11.350 --> 14:14.180
You know, I say, next, we take on Koothrappali and his dog.

14:14.180 --> 14:16.240
Really give ourselves a challenge.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.730
I just want to say one more thing about this.

14:18.730 --> 14:21.010
Just because Penny and I are very different people

14:21.010 --> 14:23.400
does not mean that we're a bad couple.

14:23.400 --> 14:26.500
The answer is one simple test away.

14:26.500 --> 14:27.980
You know, it's like when I thought

14:27.980 --> 14:30.120
there was a possum in my closet.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.720
Did I sit around wondering?

14:31.720 --> 14:35.610
No, I sent Leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag.

14:36.380 --> 14:38.800
I killed his Chewbacca slippers.

14:42.070 --> 14:43.190
Let's just take the test.

14:43.190 --> 14:44.460
No, no, no, I don't want to.

14:44.460 --> 14:46.120
Oh, well, 'cause you know we're gonna do bad.

14:46.120 --> 14:47.470
Because it doesn't matter.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.950
I don't care if we're a ten or a two.

14:49.950 --> 14:52.740
Or a one. A one is possible.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.070
Marriage is scary.

14:56.070 --> 14:57.620
You're scared, I'm scared.

14:57.620 --> 15:00.450
But it doesn't make me not want to do it.

15:00.450 --> 15:01.450
It-it just...

15:02.660 --> 15:05.710
makes me want to hold your hand and do it with you.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.020
Leonard...

15:11.200 --> 15:14.670
It would make me so happy if you said things like that.

15:14.970 --> 15:16.120
We got an eight-point-two.

15:16.120 --> 15:17.790
Trust me, you're happy.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.640
I love how they put a waterfall at center field.

15:30.640 --> 15:33.610
It really ties the whole stadium together.

15:33.610 --> 15:35.800
Look at you, talking sports.

15:37.760 --> 15:39.200
This is fun, huh?

15:39.200 --> 15:41.110
We get to see our friend throw out the first pitch,

15:41.110 --> 15:42.800
have a hot dog, watch the game.

15:44.540 --> 15:47.400
Nobody said anything about watching the game.

15:48.760 --> 15:50.820
Sheldon, what did you expect?

15:51.410 --> 15:53.410
I expected to see Howard throw the baseball,

15:53.410 --> 15:54.900
finish my hot dog,

15:54.900 --> 15:56.840
and hightail it across the street to Disneyland

15:56.840 --> 15:59.610
just in time for Mickey's Soundsational Parade.

16:00.780 --> 16:02.050
I'll tell you what.

16:02.050 --> 16:05.310
If we stay, I'll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead.

16:06.590 --> 16:08.370
Who's the bobblehead of?

16:08.370 --> 16:10.010
Does it matter?

16:10.450 --> 16:12.520
No, as long as it bobbles.

16:14.810 --> 16:16.970
Howie, I am so proud of you.

16:16.970 --> 16:19.280
Thanks. I'm proud of me, too.

16:20.490 --> 16:21.390
You ready?

16:22.110 --> 16:22.900
Let's do it.

16:22.900 --> 16:23.940
All right.

16:27.140 --> 16:27.930
Wish me luck.

16:27.930 --> 16:29.050
Go get 'em.

16:29.460 --> 16:30.370
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:30.370 --> 16:32.920
in honor of Space Day at Angel Stadium,

16:32.920 --> 16:34.540
the first pitch will be thrown out

16:34.540 --> 16:37.540
by NASA astronaut Howard Wolowitz.

16:41.130 --> 16:42.250
Thank you.

16:42.760 --> 16:44.090
Thank you.

16:44.710 --> 16:45.990
Can he really throw a ball?

16:45.990 --> 16:48.560
- On our Quidditch team, he... - Yeah, that's a "No."

16:49.420 --> 16:54.600
I have a message for the young people here today.

16:54.910 --> 16:57.950
When I was asked to throw the first pitch,

16:58.180 --> 17:03.350
a little voice in my head said I couldn't do it.

17:03.350 --> 17:06.480
So, I practiced and practiced,

17:06.480 --> 17:08.040
and you know what?

17:08.410 --> 17:10.020
That little voice...

17:11.060 --> 17:12.850
...was right, but...

17:14.750 --> 17:18.770
...then I remembered that I'm not an athlete.

17:18.770 --> 17:21.000
I'm a scientist.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.220
So, today's first pitch

17:23.220 --> 17:27.250
will be delivered to home plate by science.

17:27.250 --> 17:28.550
Ladies and gentlemen,

17:28.550 --> 17:30.850
boys and girls, I present to you

17:30.850 --> 17:36.680
a working prototype of the Mars Rover!

17:41.590 --> 17:43.830
And here's the wind-up...

17:44.760 --> 17:46.400
and the pitch!

17:57.640 --> 18:00.050
Why is it going so slow?!

18:00.050 --> 18:02.890
'Cause I'm an idiot who didn't think this through!

18:04.140 --> 18:05.460
Okay, new plan.

18:05.660 --> 18:07.260
We go to Disneyland,

18:07.260 --> 18:09.490
play hide and seek on Tom Sawyer's Island,

18:09.490 --> 18:12.560
and then come back and see the end of the pitch.

18:22.250 --> 18:24.900
Okay, while we're waiting for the ball to arrive,

18:24.900 --> 18:27.230
here's some fun facts about Mars.

18:27.230 --> 18:29.450
You suck, Wolowitz!

18:31.870 --> 18:34.270
He makes a valid point!

18:50.210 --> 18:53.240
Okay, booing isn't gonna make it go any faster!
