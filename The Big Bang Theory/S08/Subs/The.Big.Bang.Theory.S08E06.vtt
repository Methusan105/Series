WEBVTT

00:03.900 --> 00:04.970
I like your suit.

00:04.970 --> 00:07.690
Oh, thanks. Got a couple new outfits for work.

00:07.690 --> 00:09.470
How does it feel knowing your fiancee's job

00:09.470 --> 00:11.560
is to go out and flirt with doctors,

00:11.560 --> 00:12.490
looking like that,

00:12.490 --> 00:14.620
while you sit here, you know...

00:14.620 --> 00:16.770
looking like this?

00:17.570 --> 00:18.870
She doesn't flirt with doctors.

00:18.870 --> 00:21.000
Yeah. It's all very professional.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.200
You know when you bend over, I can see down your shirt?

00:23.200 --> 00:24.730
Okay, good.

00:26.460 --> 00:27.420
Speaking of new careers,

00:27.420 --> 00:29.670
how are things going with dark matter, Sheldon?

00:29.670 --> 00:32.130
Oh, yeah, I'd have to say it's the most exiting time

00:32.130 --> 00:33.710
in the history of the field.

00:33.990 --> 00:35.530
What's going on?

00:35.530 --> 00:37.960
I started doing it.

00:38.570 --> 00:39.500
You know, the government funded

00:39.500 --> 00:42.410
the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter.

00:42.410 --> 00:43.750
Oh, yeah, I've read about that--

00:43.750 --> 00:47.080
they're sending research teams down into abandoned salt mines.

00:47.080 --> 00:49.800
Sheldon, if we apply to be one of those teams,

00:49.800 --> 00:52.450
we could be on the ground floor of something big--

00:52.450 --> 00:54.990
not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well.

00:54.990 --> 00:58.180
Wait, hang on-- you guys are gonna work in a mine?

00:58.180 --> 00:59.080
Why not?

00:59.080 --> 01:02.570
You had a panic attack when we went through the car wash.

01:02.570 --> 01:05.170
Perhaps the emotion you're referring to was shock

01:05.170 --> 01:07.340
at you having something cleaned.

01:08.480 --> 01:09.860
I think what Penny meant is,

01:09.860 --> 01:12.430
the thought of you two in a mine is kind of funny--

01:12.430 --> 01:15.470
it's like a cat riding a Roomba.

01:15.470 --> 01:16.900
If they get scared, they'll have those hats

01:16.900 --> 01:18.710
with the lights on them, 'cause down there

01:18.710 --> 01:21.700
it's night-night all the time!

01:22.480 --> 01:23.330
Maybe they could ride around

01:23.330 --> 01:24.770
in one of those mine carts that go,

01:24.770 --> 01:26.990
ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo.

01:27.540 --> 01:31.460
Yeah, it'll help them get away when they see a gh-gh-ghost...!

01:33.190 --> 01:35.130
- Are they making fun of us? - Yup.

01:35.130 --> 01:38.530
I miss the old days when I couldn't tell.

02:04.390 --> 02:06.830
So, one of my favorite video games of all time

02:06.830 --> 02:08.450
is called Shadow of the Colossus,

02:08.450 --> 02:10.000
and it was only for PlayStation 2,

02:10.000 --> 02:11.750
but then they came out with a new version

02:11.750 --> 02:13.740
for PS3 with better graphics.

02:13.740 --> 02:15.020
I finally got the chance to play it,

02:15.020 --> 02:19.140
and for some reason, it just wasn't as good as the first one.

02:23.170 --> 02:25.750
Or something about yoga.

02:26.850 --> 02:28.930
I'm sorry-- I was thinking about work.

02:28.930 --> 02:30.980
Well, I was just saying that there was this video game...

02:30.980 --> 02:33.620
Yeah, that's when I started thinking about work.

02:34.050 --> 02:36.340
Uh, listen, I've got some good news.

02:38.190 --> 02:39.920
This is for you.

02:44.810 --> 02:45.940
What is this?

02:45.940 --> 02:47.750
Well, you know how they gave me the company car?

02:47.750 --> 02:50.400
Didn't make sense to have two, so I sold the other one.

02:50.400 --> 02:51.770
The one I gave you?

02:51.770 --> 02:53.100
Yeah. And there's your money back...

02:53.100 --> 02:54.280
and now we're even.

02:54.280 --> 02:56.280
How great is that?

02:56.930 --> 02:59.160
Uh, yeah.

02:59.710 --> 03:00.900
What?

03:01.500 --> 03:02.580
Nothing.

03:02.580 --> 03:03.900
Oh, come on, Leonard,

03:03.900 --> 03:05.390
I know the car was a thoughtful gesture

03:05.390 --> 03:06.520
and I really appreciate it,

03:06.520 --> 03:08.670
but it doesn't make sense to have both.

03:08.670 --> 03:10.890
- You're right. - What should I have done?

03:10.890 --> 03:12.760
Taken a picture of us in the car

03:12.760 --> 03:13.900
and put it in a pink frame

03:13.900 --> 03:18.320
with puffy paint around it that says "Best Fiance Ever"?

03:20.090 --> 03:21.900
Doesn't sound that bad.

03:22.340 --> 03:24.740
Well, good, because... that's why I did!

03:28.330 --> 03:30.650
Thank you. That-that is so sweet.

03:30.650 --> 03:31.850
No, it's not that sweet...

03:31.850 --> 03:33.010
I paid for the frame with your money

03:33.010 --> 03:35.060
and then got a massage.

03:36.440 --> 03:38.900
You know what, you don't have to give me this.

03:38.900 --> 03:40.020
You keep it.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.640
- Why? - The car was a gift...

03:41.640 --> 03:42.530
it was something you needed.

03:42.530 --> 03:44.340
I was happy to help you out.

03:44.340 --> 03:46.700
And I really appreciate it, but now I don't need it,

03:46.700 --> 03:48.790
so... here you go.

03:48.790 --> 03:50.700
Well, this is silly-- so you don't need the car,

03:50.700 --> 03:52.560
but you could use it to buy yourself something else,

03:52.560 --> 03:56.310
like a... new purse to put all this money in.

03:56.920 --> 03:58.210
Sweetie, I can buy my own stuff.

03:58.210 --> 03:59.510
I have a good job now.

03:59.510 --> 04:00.630
I know, and I'm proud of you,

04:00.630 --> 04:03.170
but that doesn't mean I can't do something nice.

04:03.170 --> 04:05.220
Like this.

04:06.020 --> 04:07.650
Okay, I don't want this to turn into a fight.

04:07.650 --> 04:09.200
- I don't, either. - Great.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.650
Thank you.

04:14.010 --> 04:15.850
- Can you pass the salt, please? - Sure.

04:22.660 --> 04:24.840
In my mind, that broke the tension with comedy

04:24.840 --> 04:27.130
and led to sex.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.280
Hey, Sheldon, you busy?

04:34.280 --> 04:36.100
I'm always busy.

04:36.100 --> 04:39.570
This mind is capable of advanced multitasking.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.540
You know, currently, I'm attempting to solve

04:41.540 --> 04:43.080
the Penrose conjecture,

04:43.080 --> 04:45.410
I'm composing my Nobel acceptance speech

04:45.410 --> 04:47.950
for when I've solved the Penrose conjecture,

04:47.950 --> 04:51.500
and I'm wondering how mermaids have babies.

04:52.820 --> 04:55.560
Don't they lay eggs on a rock?

04:57.560 --> 04:59.290
Now I've got room for another thing.

04:59.290 --> 05:00.820
What do you want?

05:01.270 --> 05:02.670
So, I did a little research on what

05:02.670 --> 05:04.770
the conditions are like in the mines,

05:04.770 --> 05:06.370
and the guys might be right--

05:06.370 --> 05:07.720
sounds pretty rough down there.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.910
For starters, it's very humid,

05:09.910 --> 05:11.690
and about a hundred degrees.

05:11.690 --> 05:14.540
Well, I'm from Texas and you're from India...

05:14.540 --> 05:19.080
we're no strangers to the fragrant armpit. Next.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.660
It's also a live mine,

05:21.660 --> 05:23.890
so there'll be dynamite explosions going off in the distance.

05:23.890 --> 05:26.150
Yeah, I have a lactose-intolerant roommate

05:26.150 --> 05:29.370
with a taste for ice cream. Next.

05:29.370 --> 05:32.490
Oh, you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time.

05:32.490 --> 05:34.820
Yeah? We have to be somewhere.

05:35.350 --> 05:36.410
Well, there's no toilets...

05:36.410 --> 05:38.200
we'll have to do our business in a bucket.

05:38.200 --> 05:41.440
So it's settled... we're not doing it.

05:42.870 --> 05:44.360
Look, I get it, but...

05:44.360 --> 05:46.870
before we pass up on an incredible opportunity,

05:46.870 --> 05:50.170
I was thinking about when Howard was training to go to space,

05:50.170 --> 05:52.400
they put him in a simulated environment.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.010
Interesting.

05:54.010 --> 05:56.050
You're suggesting that we recreate

05:56.050 --> 05:57.570
the conditions of the mine

05:57.570 --> 05:59.580
- to see if we can handle it. - Exactly.

05:59.580 --> 06:01.920
- Very well. - So where should we do it?

06:01.920 --> 06:05.350
Well, I'll just Google "Hot, dark and moist,"

06:05.350 --> 06:07.020
see what comes up.

06:09.320 --> 06:10.170
Uh, Sheldon...

06:10.170 --> 06:13.620
Oh, there, well, look, there's all kinds of videos.

06:17.400 --> 06:18.320
Hey, you got a sec?

06:18.320 --> 06:19.450
Hi. Sure.

06:19.450 --> 06:21.580
I was hoping we could talk about the money again.

06:21.580 --> 06:24.080
- Oh, sweetie, just forget about it. - No, no, no, no,

06:24.080 --> 06:26.460
hear me out. I know things got a little weird last night.

06:26.460 --> 06:28.370
Well, leaving an envelope full of cash

06:28.370 --> 06:30.040
on my dresser after sex

06:30.040 --> 06:32.190
would count as weird.

06:34.070 --> 06:36.540
Well, I think I came up with a pretty good solution.

06:36.950 --> 06:39.160
Why don't we just put the money in a joint account?

06:39.160 --> 06:40.420
It'll be our first money together.

06:40.420 --> 06:42.990
We can use it for the wedding, the honeymoon, whatever.

06:42.990 --> 06:44.980
You know what, that's great. I love that!

06:44.980 --> 06:46.170
Yeah, of course you do...

06:46.170 --> 06:48.570
I'm not just a genius in bed.

06:56.460 --> 06:58.620
You sure are, baby.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.860
You two want to be alone?

07:03.420 --> 07:05.560
I want you to know I get why you don't want the money...

07:05.560 --> 07:07.250
you've got this new job, you're excited

07:07.250 --> 07:08.900
about being financially independent...

07:08.900 --> 07:10.960
and I am nothing but proud of you.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.720
Oh, thank you so much.

07:12.720 --> 07:14.730
It feels so good to hear you say that.

07:14.730 --> 07:15.680
And I want you to know

07:15.680 --> 07:17.380
that I get this job kind of changes

07:17.380 --> 07:18.960
the balance in our relationship,

07:18.960 --> 07:21.650
and... I'm trying to be sensitive to that.

07:24.180 --> 07:26.230
What?

07:26.730 --> 07:28.680
Well, I just think that maybe you're a little hung up

07:28.680 --> 07:30.740
on the money because I'm less reliant on you now,

07:30.740 --> 07:32.750
and that's a little scary.

07:35.910 --> 07:37.860
Maybe.

07:38.720 --> 07:42.140
Or maybe I tried to do something nice

07:42.140 --> 07:44.110
and maybe you had a problem with it

07:44.110 --> 07:46.530
because of your control issues.

07:48.610 --> 07:50.620
Control issues?

07:51.050 --> 07:52.600
Maybe.

07:53.630 --> 07:55.650
Or... maybe...

07:55.650 --> 07:57.990
now that I'm no longer an out-of-work actress

07:57.990 --> 07:59.650
who can't pay for her own dinner,

07:59.650 --> 08:01.980
that makes you a little insecure.

08:01.980 --> 08:03.120
Well, I can't believe you'd say that.

08:03.120 --> 08:06.920
You know how insecure I am about my insecurities.

08:09.060 --> 08:10.230
You know what? I'm sorry.

08:10.230 --> 08:11.730
It's stupid to fight over money.

08:11.730 --> 08:12.960
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.520
We're about to share the rest of our lives together.

08:15.520 --> 08:17.740
It's our money-- who cares who has it?

08:17.740 --> 08:19.940
Ugh! You're right-- who cares?

08:22.060 --> 08:23.390
Get that money out of my back pocket

08:23.390 --> 08:25.610
or I will break your fingers.

08:29.000 --> 08:29.930
All this time I never knew

08:29.930 --> 08:31.600
there were steam tunnels down here.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.380
Most universities have them.

08:33.380 --> 08:36.320
When I was an undergrad, I spent three days in one

08:36.320 --> 08:38.360
pledging a sorority.

08:39.820 --> 08:40.640
Did you get in?

08:40.640 --> 08:41.910
No. They forgot I was there.

08:41.910 --> 08:44.680
But it really opened up my pores.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.720
Well, according to my research,

08:47.720 --> 08:50.780
the steam tunnels below this access point

08:50.780 --> 08:53.580
should be the closest analog to the mines.

08:53.580 --> 08:54.880
This is gonna be so much more accurate

08:54.880 --> 08:56.260
than the steam room at the gym.

08:56.260 --> 08:57.460
Plus, there's almost no chance

08:57.460 --> 09:00.520
we'll see any of our coworkers half naked.

09:01.020 --> 09:02.620
Or totally naked.

09:02.620 --> 09:03.360
I love Howard,

09:03.360 --> 09:05.880
but the dude needs a little shame.

09:06.490 --> 09:08.700
All right, Amy, this walkie-talkie is yours.

09:08.700 --> 09:11.390
If we run into any problems, I'll contact you.

09:11.390 --> 09:13.840
And if anything bad happens, what's the rule?

09:13.840 --> 09:17.650
Save you first; come back for Raj only if there's time.

09:18.140 --> 09:20.160
We're going to be fine.

09:20.960 --> 09:21.980
Sheldon, I'm really impressed

09:21.980 --> 09:23.540
you're willing to try this.

09:23.540 --> 09:26.740
Well, admittedly, this brushes up against my well-known aversions

09:26.740 --> 09:28.870
to heat, small places,

09:28.870 --> 09:30.380
going below floor-level,

09:30.380 --> 09:32.870
dampness, hatches, ladders,

09:32.870 --> 09:34.730
darkness, echoes,

09:34.730 --> 09:37.980
and eliminating in Home Depot buckets.

09:37.980 --> 09:40.630
That last one is quite new, but I have a feeling

09:40.630 --> 09:43.500
that's gonna rocket to the top of the list.

09:52.970 --> 09:55.400
I'm sweating already.

09:56.120 --> 10:00.330
Yeah, as the person beneath you, allow me to say, I know.

10:04.540 --> 10:05.690
How hot is it?

10:05.690 --> 10:08.770
Uh, let's see. 704?

10:08.770 --> 10:11.090
No, wait, it's on "Clock."

10:11.720 --> 10:13.440
No, the real answer isn't much better.

10:13.440 --> 10:16.110
102 degrees.

10:16.110 --> 10:17.180
Well, that's what we wanted.

10:17.180 --> 10:20.420
- This is as hot as the mines will be. - True.

10:20.980 --> 10:25.390
Sheldon's Mine Simulation Log, entry one.

10:25.390 --> 10:27.600
Koothrappali's restating of the obvious

10:27.600 --> 10:30.260
is already getting on my nerves.

10:33.140 --> 10:34.550
Thanks again for having us.

10:34.550 --> 10:37.150
Oh, of course. What did you guys want to talk about?

10:37.150 --> 10:39.180
Well, you know, now that we're engaged,

10:39.180 --> 10:40.290
we had some questions about

10:40.290 --> 10:43.060
how you handle money as a couple.

10:43.060 --> 10:46.660
I told you they weren't gonna ask us to swing with them.

10:48.330 --> 10:49.750
I didn't think they were going to.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.250
I just wanted to have a way to say no

10:51.250 --> 10:53.880
without hurting Leonard's feelings.

10:54.360 --> 10:57.010
Well... nailed it.

10:57.480 --> 10:58.850
So what did you want to know?

10:58.850 --> 11:01.570
Well, do you guys ever fight over money?

11:01.570 --> 11:03.300
Sure, sometimes.

11:03.300 --> 11:04.560
I mean, it can be a little awkward

11:04.560 --> 11:07.310
since I make so much more money than Howie.

11:08.670 --> 11:10.850
You didn't have to say "so much more."

11:10.850 --> 11:12.660
Well, I didn't have to, but for the sake of accuracy

11:12.660 --> 11:14.940
I felt that I should.

11:15.880 --> 11:18.660
I brought a lot of significant assets into the relationship, too.

11:18.660 --> 11:19.390
Like what?

11:19.390 --> 11:23.070
Your incomplete set of Star Trek collector plates?

11:23.890 --> 11:25.210
For your information, I just bought the last one

11:25.210 --> 11:27.370
I needed on eBay.

11:27.860 --> 11:30.160
Without asking me?

11:30.730 --> 11:32.600
There were only three minutes left in the auction

11:32.600 --> 11:34.520
and it was a mint condition Scotty

11:34.520 --> 11:36.950
from a smoke-free home.

11:39.020 --> 11:39.880
How much, Howie?

11:39.880 --> 11:41.000
Not a lot.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.190
How much?

11:43.190 --> 11:46.410
Let's not talk about this in front of our friends.

11:46.410 --> 11:50.350
Was it more or less than falconry school?

11:50.930 --> 11:54.780
For the tenth time, that was a Groupon.

11:56.900 --> 11:59.450
Like I would swing with him.

12:03.840 --> 12:05.400
How you feeling?

12:05.400 --> 12:06.620
Good.

12:07.350 --> 12:09.700
Little claustrophobic.

12:09.700 --> 12:10.930
Let's set up the equipment.

12:10.930 --> 12:13.360
It'll help take your mind off of it.

12:13.780 --> 12:17.330
Miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up.

12:17.330 --> 12:18.730
Do you know any mining songs?

12:18.730 --> 12:20.750
Just the hits.

12:22.290 --> 12:25.340
Where it's dark as a dungeon

12:25.340 --> 12:27.510
And it's damp as the dew

12:27.510 --> 12:28.350
That's pretty.

12:28.350 --> 12:30.870
Where the dangers are double

12:30.870 --> 12:34.040
And the pleasures are few

12:34.040 --> 12:36.580
Where the rain never falls

12:36.580 --> 12:39.240
And the sun never shines

12:39.240 --> 12:41.930
Yes, it's dark as a dungeon

12:41.930 --> 12:44.370
Way down in the mine

12:44.370 --> 12:46.850
It's a little more bleak than I thought.

12:46.850 --> 12:49.160
Well, I pray when I dead

12:49.160 --> 12:51.660
And the ages shall roll

12:51.660 --> 12:54.700
That my body will blacken

12:54.700 --> 12:57.000
And turn into coal

12:57.000 --> 12:59.370
Getting kind of grim.

13:00.660 --> 13:03.270
Then I'll look from the door

13:03.270 --> 13:05.850
Of my heavenly home

13:05.850 --> 13:08.370
And pity the miner

13:08.370 --> 13:11.790
That mines my poor bones.

13:13.430 --> 13:18.430
Okay. How 'bout a little Miley Cyrus next?

13:18.290 --> 13:20.060
Who's he?

13:23.660 --> 13:25.660
Talk about wasted money.

13:25.660 --> 13:27.500
What about the late fees on our credit card

13:27.500 --> 13:29.330
because somebody didn't pay the bill on time?

13:29.330 --> 13:30.570
Well, maybe I would have paid it

13:30.570 --> 13:33.010
if I wasn't also doing everything else around here.

13:33.010 --> 13:35.620
Oh, you're saying I don't do anything around here.

13:38.070 --> 13:39.980
Look at my chore chart.

13:41.250 --> 13:43.580
- She made him a chore chart. - I see it.

13:44.320 --> 13:47.500
"Do the dishes." There's a star right there.

13:47.500 --> 13:50.340
That was a pity star. Putting water in the roasting pan

13:50.340 --> 13:53.800
and leaving it in the sink is not doing the dishes.

13:53.800 --> 13:57.880
That pan had to soak and you know it.

13:58.380 --> 13:59.780
Well, don't come crying to me

13:59.780 --> 14:01.880
when you don't get your allowance.

14:02.830 --> 14:03.590
It's not an allowance.

14:03.590 --> 14:04.630
It's a stipend!

14:04.630 --> 14:06.570
And we said we weren't gonna call it an allowance

14:06.570 --> 14:09.080
in front of my friends.

14:12.860 --> 14:14.710
I usually don't like lemon bars,

14:14.710 --> 14:17.710
but th-these are really good.

14:19.580 --> 14:21.860
So, as Hannah Montana,

14:22.500 --> 14:24.960
Miley was a world-famous pop star.

14:24.960 --> 14:26.870
But then she would take off her wig and go to school

14:26.870 --> 14:27.840
like a normal girl.

14:27.840 --> 14:29.150
Which, I don't have to tell you,

14:29.150 --> 14:32.030
at that age, is its own headache.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.500
That's preposterous.

14:34.500 --> 14:37.550
How would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig?

14:37.550 --> 14:39.700
But you're okay with Superman concealing his identity

14:39.700 --> 14:40.990
with a pair of glasses?

14:40.990 --> 14:42.830
He doesn't just put on a pair of glasses.

14:42.830 --> 14:44.460
He combs back his curlicue

14:44.460 --> 14:47.090
and affects a mild-mannered personality.

14:48.650 --> 14:50.430
You guys doing okay down there?

14:50.430 --> 14:53.550
I told you to use the walkie-talkie!

14:54.600 --> 14:56.910
You guys doing okay down there?

14:58.340 --> 15:00.150
Please keep this channel clear for emergencies.

15:00.150 --> 15:01.590
Thank you.

15:02.900 --> 15:06.080
I'm going to the vending machine. Do you want anything?

15:06.330 --> 15:07.720
This is a simulation.

15:07.720 --> 15:10.010
We have to survive on the supplies we brought.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.650
Okay, just checking.

15:12.650 --> 15:15.340
We should have asked her to get some Funyuns.

15:16.100 --> 15:17.350
You're not going to have Funyuns

15:17.350 --> 15:19.490
when we're a mile below the surface of the Earth.

15:19.490 --> 15:22.010
What if we brought them down with us?

15:22.920 --> 15:25.570
We'll take some Funyuns.

15:25.570 --> 15:27.120
Anything else?

15:27.530 --> 15:29.390
Some York Peppermint Patties,

15:29.390 --> 15:31.010
a couple of Dr. Peppers, and...

15:31.010 --> 15:33.970
run to Best Buy and see if they have a portable DVD player

15:33.970 --> 15:37.670
and season one of a show called Hannah Montana.

15:38.390 --> 15:39.820
Have her get season two.

15:39.820 --> 15:42.520
Season one, it was still finding itself.

15:44.190 --> 15:45.710
Sorry you guys had to see that.

15:45.710 --> 15:47.570
- Oh, don't apologize. - Yeah.

15:47.570 --> 15:51.090
It just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened.

15:51.630 --> 15:53.270
Money's a sensitive subject for Howie

15:53.270 --> 15:55.050
because of the difference in our income.

15:55.050 --> 15:56.280
It really bothers him?

15:56.280 --> 15:57.670
Well, sure. There's still a lot of pressure

15:57.670 --> 15:59.350
on guys to be providers.

15:59.350 --> 16:01.000
So even though he's happy for me,

16:01.000 --> 16:02.740
it's just a little tough on him.

16:02.740 --> 16:05.000
- Uh-oh. - What?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.560
Well, if I do well in sales,

16:06.560 --> 16:08.700
I could end up making a lot more money than you.

16:08.700 --> 16:10.510
Not a problem. I grew up with a mother

16:10.510 --> 16:12.470
who emasculated my father financially

16:12.470 --> 16:15.240
and in every other aspect of his life, so...

16:16.290 --> 16:19.450
...really, it's what I think love looks like.

16:21.290 --> 16:23.720
I'll be right back. I'm gonna go check on him.

16:25.430 --> 16:27.300
Maybe it's a good thing we came here.

16:27.300 --> 16:29.180
- It's like a lesson in what not to do. - Yeah.

16:29.180 --> 16:31.690
I don't want something dumb like money to come between us.

16:31.690 --> 16:33.880
It won't. Let's just promise to figure this kind of stuff out

16:33.880 --> 16:35.410
before we get married.

16:35.410 --> 16:37.470
Why are you being so bossy?!

16:37.470 --> 16:39.200
Why are you being a baby?

16:39.200 --> 16:41.940
I'm not a baby! I'm a grown man,

16:41.940 --> 16:45.350
and I made the bed. Now where's my star?

16:48.160 --> 16:49.880
- Should we go? - Hang on.

16:49.880 --> 16:52.510
I want to see if he gets the star.

16:55.320 --> 16:57.460
Oh, this heat is brutal.

16:57.460 --> 17:00.200
As someone from the tropical subcontinent of India,

17:00.200 --> 17:02.930
you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment

17:02.930 --> 17:04.930
only raises your body temperature.

17:05.990 --> 17:07.920
That does explain why the servants used to look so hot

17:07.920 --> 17:10.060
while they were fanning me.

17:10.990 --> 17:13.580
Let's get our minds off how uncomfortable we are.

17:13.580 --> 17:16.100
We could take some more simulated instrument readings.

17:16.100 --> 17:17.530
My major focus at the moment

17:17.530 --> 17:19.930
is keeping my claustrophobia at bay.

17:19.930 --> 17:22.110
- How's that going? - You tell me.

17:22.110 --> 17:23.490
I feel like I can't breathe,

17:23.490 --> 17:25.900
and I am tempted to crack you open

17:25.900 --> 17:28.570
and suck the air right out of your lungs.

17:30.190 --> 17:32.650
Sheldon, if this is too much, we can stop.

17:32.650 --> 17:33.970
We're not stopping.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.680
You don't have to bite my head off.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.350
I apologize.

17:37.350 --> 17:38.370
I j...

17:38.370 --> 17:41.320
I'm plagued by an internal struggle.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.030
If you would just use the bucket,

17:43.030 --> 17:45.200
you'd be so much more comfortable.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.780
My struggle is emotional.

17:49.210 --> 17:50.590
Is it Amy?

17:50.940 --> 17:52.870
It's dark matter.

17:53.510 --> 17:57.580
When I entered the field of string theory, I was a prodigy.

17:57.580 --> 18:01.040
I rose to a position of respect,

18:01.040 --> 18:03.910
and I assumed my career would continue

18:03.910 --> 18:06.430
on that upward trajectory.

18:06.430 --> 18:08.950
Now here I am in my 30s,

18:08.950 --> 18:11.810
I'm back at square one.

18:12.610 --> 18:15.610
And, frankly, it's frightening.

18:16.590 --> 18:19.570
Sheldon, you know what I think of when I'm scared?

18:19.570 --> 18:21.670
Voyager.

18:22.140 --> 18:23.390
Voyager the space probe

18:23.390 --> 18:26.930
or Voyager the Star Trek TV show?

18:27.410 --> 18:28.490
The space probe.

18:28.490 --> 18:30.120
Good. Because I am too hot and tired

18:30.120 --> 18:33.780
to go on about how much I hate Voyager the TV show.

18:35.020 --> 18:36.490
By the time I was born,

18:36.490 --> 18:39.040
Voyager 1's mission was supposed to be over.

18:39.040 --> 18:40.740
It had seen Jupiter

18:40.740 --> 18:42.950
and Saturn and all their moons,

18:42.950 --> 18:45.900
but it kept going.

18:46.370 --> 18:48.230
When I left India for America,

18:48.230 --> 18:51.030
I was never more scared in my life.

18:51.030 --> 18:53.860
I had no idea what lay ahead.

18:53.860 --> 18:55.910
Whenever I feel that way, I think about how...

18:55.910 --> 19:00.040
Voyager is still out there

19:00.040 --> 19:02.480
somewhere beyond our solar system,

19:02.480 --> 19:05.740
going further than anyone ever thought it could.

19:08.910 --> 19:11.560
Don't leave! You can do this!

19:13.730 --> 19:15.170
Sheldon, is everything okay?

19:15.170 --> 19:16.720
It's too late for Koothrappali.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.120
Let's go!

19:21.080 --> 19:24.250
11 minutes. That's longer than I thought.

19:26.050 --> 19:27.010
They're in my shirt!

19:27.010 --> 19:29.420
They're in my shirt! They're in my shirt!

19:33.560 --> 19:35.130
Okay, this is definitely the most fun thing

19:35.130 --> 19:36.880
we can do with the money.

19:40.800 --> 19:44.300
I've never done it on a big old pile of cash before.

19:47.240 --> 19:50.270
"Me neither, Leonard. It's my first time, too."

19:54.560 --> 19:57.350
I'm so sorry I made you feel bad about the money stuff.

19:57.350 --> 20:00.250
- It's okay. - No, it's not okay.

20:00.250 --> 20:02.920
I want us to be partners, equals.

20:02.920 --> 20:05.490
Adults in a mature relationship.

20:05.490 --> 20:07.280
I want that, too.

20:08.850 --> 20:11.040
Now, let's talk about your birthday party.

20:11.040 --> 20:12.870
Ooh, laser tag, laser tag. Oh!

20:15.940 --> 20:17.930
Do you really need me to transcribe this?

20:17.930 --> 20:19.490
You're not doing it for me.

20:19.490 --> 20:21.550
You're doing it for future generations

20:21.550 --> 20:24.110
who will benefit from my struggle.

20:25.410 --> 20:28.180
Sheldon's Mine Simulation Log,

20:28.680 --> 20:30.360
entry four:

20:30.360 --> 20:32.980
my Kit Kat has melted.

20:34.640 --> 20:36.590
All is lost.

20:38.010 --> 20:40.340
You call yourself a friend?!

20:40.340 --> 20:41.970
I was trying to help you!

20:41.970 --> 20:43.720
And at the first sign of trouble

20:43.720 --> 20:48.910
you ran away, leaving me to fend off a family of rats!

20:49.560 --> 20:51.330
You're a completely selfish human being

20:51.330 --> 20:54.710
and a... and a physical and a moral coward!

20:56.490 --> 21:00.060
His statements of the obvious continue to annoy.
