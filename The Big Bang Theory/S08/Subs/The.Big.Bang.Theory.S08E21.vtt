00:03.570 --> 00:06.300
Hey, would you like to hear some songs I've rewritten

00:06.300 --> 00:08.690
to get children interested in the hard sciences?

00:08.690 --> 00:10.140
- Sure. - Really?

00:10.140 --> 00:12.590
Yeah. Well, I like music, I like science,

00:12.590 --> 00:15.010
I like making fun of Sheldon. Hit it.

00:16.300 --> 00:18.620
There was a scientist who had a theory

00:18.620 --> 00:20.560
And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o

00:20.560 --> 00:22.400
J-a-m-e-s

00:22.400 --> 00:24.210
C-l-e-r-k

00:24.210 --> 00:26.720
Space M-A-X-W-E-L-L

00:26.720 --> 00:29.760
And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o

00:30.170 --> 00:32.000
There was a scientist who had a theory

00:32.000 --> 00:33.990
And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o

00:33.990 --> 00:35.580
A-m-e-s

00:35.580 --> 00:37.460
Uh, okay, okay. Uh, we-we get it.

00:37.460 --> 00:40.070
Perhaps you'd prefer this one.

00:40.070 --> 00:44.780
The itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all

00:44.780 --> 00:46.930
Because it has eight legs

00:46.930 --> 00:50.000
And two body parts

00:50.650 --> 00:51.910
That's pretty cool, Sheldon.

00:51.910 --> 00:53.060
Thank you.

00:53.060 --> 00:55.230
Do either of you know Beyonce?

00:55.230 --> 00:58.380
I'd love her to get behind it.

01:00.500 --> 01:02.270
You guys know the new Discovery class missions

01:02.270 --> 01:04.070
- that NASA's been working on? - Yeah.

01:04.070 --> 01:06.100
Well, they're looking to include a message from Earth

01:06.100 --> 01:08.840
in case one of them is encountered by alien life.

01:09.420 --> 01:11.400
When I encountered alien life, I-I discovered

01:11.400 --> 01:15.110
that the key thing was not to sit in its spot.

01:16.120 --> 01:18.760
All right, you can't breathe our air without an inhaler,

01:18.760 --> 01:20.140
he's allergic to Earth nuts,

01:20.140 --> 01:22.340
but I'm the alien.

01:22.880 --> 01:25.640
Anyway, I'm among a handful of scientists

01:25.640 --> 01:27.910
that have been asked to submit a design proposal

01:27.910 --> 01:29.960
for the message and its delivery system.

01:29.960 --> 01:31.480
- Excellent. - Congratulations.

01:31.480 --> 01:34.220
And I was wondering if any of you guys

01:34.220 --> 01:35.740
would like to help me do it.

01:35.740 --> 01:38.020
Are you kidding? Yes. What did you have in mind?

01:38.020 --> 01:40.010
I'll tell you exactly what you should do:

01:40.010 --> 01:43.240
avoid the presumption of the Terran sensory input paradigm.

01:43.240 --> 01:44.000
Yeah, absolutely.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.200
You need a device capable of delivering information

01:46.200 --> 01:48.570
across a wide range of perceptual modalities.

01:48.570 --> 01:51.230
Any intelligent organism would at the very least need

01:51.230 --> 01:53.710
the ability to locate the position of objects in space.

01:53.710 --> 01:57.200
So the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.280
Ooh, how about a 3-D tactile communicator rigged

01:59.280 --> 02:00.590
for cross-sensory transposition?

02:00.590 --> 02:02.240
Exactly what I expected.

02:02.240 --> 02:03.750
Two people forcing their ideas on me

02:03.750 --> 02:05.650
and only one gentleman who could be bothered

02:05.650 --> 02:07.400
to ask me what my thoughts were.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.260
You two are out. Congratulations, Leonard,

02:09.260 --> 02:11.270
you're on the team.

02:11.660 --> 02:14.270
My mommy raised a gentleman.

02:41.030 --> 02:42.170
Hey. Thanks for coming by.

02:42.170 --> 02:43.550
Yeah. I'm excited to help.

02:43.550 --> 02:45.600
I would have included the others, but...

02:45.600 --> 02:47.330
you know exactly what would've happened.

02:47.330 --> 02:50.050
They would've taken over the project and bossed us around.

02:50.050 --> 02:51.010
I get it.

02:51.010 --> 02:52.250
Uh, just this morning,

02:52.250 --> 02:54.450
Sheldon wouldn't let me put almond milk on my Grape-Nuts

02:54.450 --> 02:57.980
because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict.

02:58.780 --> 03:00.490
You should have told him to mind his own business.

03:00.490 --> 03:03.040
Yeah. That's better than what I did say, which was,

03:03.040 --> 03:05.830
"Fine, I'll eat them with club soda."

03:06.250 --> 03:08.680
What makes them think they're always in charge of everything?

03:08.680 --> 03:10.350
Mmm, they're alpha males.

03:10.830 --> 03:11.850
What does that make us?

03:11.850 --> 03:13.980
We could be betas. They're second in charge.

03:13.980 --> 03:15.000
Okay, that sounds good.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.420
Or we could be omegas.

03:16.420 --> 03:18.750
They get pushed around by the alphas and the betas.

03:18.750 --> 03:20.670
Okay, that sounds like us.

03:21.890 --> 03:23.820
Whatever. There's no alphas here,

03:23.820 --> 03:25.190
and this is your project.

03:25.190 --> 03:27.800
You're in charge. How do you want to start?

03:28.560 --> 03:30.930
I don't know. How do you want to start?

03:32.620 --> 03:34.550
I don't know.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.420
Should we call Sheldon and Howard?

03:39.420 --> 03:41.470
No. We can do this by ourselves.

03:41.470 --> 03:43.040
Okay. Great. How do you want to start?

03:43.040 --> 03:45.070
I don't know. How do you want to start?

03:50.590 --> 03:51.390
Sheldon.

03:51.640 --> 03:52.850
Sheldon.

03:52.850 --> 03:54.870
Sheldon.

04:01.350 --> 04:03.770
I bet that started off as a joke,

04:03.770 --> 04:06.140
but by the third one you realized

04:06.140 --> 04:09.960
there was something strangely enjoyable about it.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.620
Yeah, I kind of want to do it again.

04:13.620 --> 04:17.230
I don't recommend it. You'll be doing it the rest of your life.

04:17.990 --> 04:20.890
Anyway, if you're looking for Leonard, he's with Koothrappali.

04:20.890 --> 04:22.370
Uh, no, I actually came to talk to you.

04:22.740 --> 04:25.220
How nice.

04:26.320 --> 04:28.100
Here are some topics that interest me:

04:28.100 --> 04:30.810
quantum mechanics, trains, flags...

04:30.810 --> 04:32.790
No, no. It's about my acting career.

04:32.790 --> 04:33.710
Oh, sorry.

04:33.710 --> 04:35.710
That's not on the list.

04:35.710 --> 04:36.720
Oh, wait. No.

04:36.720 --> 04:38.870
How about we split the difference

04:38.870 --> 04:42.070
and discuss why Austria was an archduchy

04:42.070 --> 04:44.430
and not just a regular duchy.

04:45.090 --> 04:46.340
Okay, look, here's the thing.

04:46.340 --> 04:48.550
I like pharmaceutical sales--it's going great--

04:48.550 --> 04:49.940
but I have an audition for a movie,

04:49.940 --> 04:52.140
and if I get it, it could screw everything up.

04:53.170 --> 04:55.280
I know exactly what you should do.

04:55.280 --> 04:57.930
Unfortunately, I cannot tell you.

04:59.220 --> 05:00.290
Well, why?

05:00.290 --> 05:03.060
I'm attempting to turn over a new leaf.

05:03.060 --> 05:05.010
Earlier today, it was pointed out to me

05:05.010 --> 05:08.360
that I tend to force my ideas on people.

05:08.770 --> 05:10.660
You're really not gonna tell me?

05:10.660 --> 05:13.980
No, that train has left the station.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.630
Now, we can play this one of two ways.

05:16.630 --> 05:19.350
You can say, "Trains, tell me more,"

05:19.350 --> 05:20.550
or...

05:20.550 --> 05:22.240
you can just look at me like that

05:22.240 --> 05:23.550
and I'll start.

05:28.500 --> 05:29.990
What's going on in here?

05:29.990 --> 05:33.270
I am making molecular cocktails.

05:33.270 --> 05:36.930
This sphere is actually a cosmopolitan.

05:37.810 --> 05:38.840
How do you drink it?

05:38.840 --> 05:42.000
Oh, just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit.

05:43.440 --> 05:45.320
I think I'll have a beer.

05:46.210 --> 05:47.590
First take a picture with me.

05:47.590 --> 05:48.250
Why?

05:48.250 --> 05:50.610
Well, Raj and I always talked about learning

05:50.610 --> 05:53.040
how to make cocktails like this together,

05:53.040 --> 05:56.860
so I taught myself and I'm putting this on Instagram

05:56.860 --> 05:58.940
so he can see it and feel like a turd.

05:58.940 --> 06:00.040
Say cheese.

06:01.490 --> 06:03.800
Is this about the space probe he's working on without you?

06:03.800 --> 06:05.960
You betcha. The very one.

06:07.580 --> 06:08.670
Howard, you're grown men.

06:08.670 --> 06:10.770
You guys don't have to do everything together.

06:10.770 --> 06:14.800
I know. That's why I'm spending tonight with you.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.000
Trying to hurt Raj's feelings.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.830
With my honeybunch.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.680
You're being childish.

06:21.680 --> 06:23.510
No. He is.

06:23.510 --> 06:26.460
So I have a dominant personality.

06:26.460 --> 06:28.210
We all know that.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.890
I'm sorry. What do we know?

06:32.270 --> 06:33.590
In social groupings,

06:33.590 --> 06:37.500
I just naturally wind up in charge.

06:37.500 --> 06:38.640
Don't take this the wrong way,

06:38.640 --> 06:41.950
but how many of these little booze balls have you had?

06:43.390 --> 06:45.040
You don't think I'm a leader?

06:45.040 --> 06:46.930
I was kidding. Of course you are.

06:46.930 --> 06:49.550
Right. I couldn't change if I wanted to.

06:49.550 --> 06:52.800
You better not change, because I love who you are.

06:52.800 --> 06:55.140
Now, will you need help cleaning all this up when you're done

06:55.140 --> 06:57.120
or can you do it all by yourself?

06:57.120 --> 06:58.520
All by myself.

06:58.520 --> 07:00.590
There's my big boss man.

07:04.390 --> 07:07.800
So, often on the front of the locomotive

07:07.800 --> 07:10.530
is a large iron wedge

07:10.530 --> 07:12.860
for clearing objects off the tracks.

07:12.860 --> 07:15.750
Now, while commonly known as a cowcatcher,

07:15.750 --> 07:20.460
I prefer the more accurate "Cow exploder."

07:21.860 --> 07:24.110
Okay. Sheldon, let me ask you a question.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.040
If I was at a train station

07:26.040 --> 07:28.860
and one train could take me to my current job

07:28.860 --> 07:31.660
and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie,

07:31.660 --> 07:34.220
which train should I get on?

07:37.210 --> 07:41.520
Are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice?

07:41.930 --> 07:43.930
No.

07:43.930 --> 07:46.020
All right, then.

07:47.180 --> 07:49.320
You should take a third train

07:49.320 --> 07:51.410
where you audition for the movie

07:51.410 --> 07:53.520
but hold off on making a career decision

07:53.520 --> 07:55.650
until you have more information.

07:56.450 --> 07:57.080
You're right.

07:57.080 --> 07:59.990
I'm worried about something that hasn't even happened yet.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.320
You are a wise man.

08:03.220 --> 08:05.970
Well, Penny, who's smarter: the wise man

08:05.970 --> 08:09.820
or the person who comes to him for advice?

08:11.610 --> 08:12.510
Oh, I guess you're right.

08:12.510 --> 08:15.300
Maybe it is the person who asks.

08:15.300 --> 08:17.950
No, it's the wise man.

08:21.070 --> 08:24.130
That's why he's called the wise man.

08:24.610 --> 08:26.240
You know how I know that?

08:26.240 --> 08:28.090
I'm the wise man.

08:29.750 --> 08:31.780
I'm sorry. What was I thinking?

08:32.180 --> 08:33.700
Uh, just out of curiosity,

08:33.700 --> 08:36.290
why didn't you ask Leonard for advice about this?

08:36.290 --> 08:37.850
'Cause I already know what he'll say.

08:37.850 --> 08:40.590
"Wah, wah, wah, you shouldn't do it."

08:40.590 --> 08:43.770
It's just like he's here!

08:45.950 --> 08:48.970
Okay, so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space,

08:48.970 --> 08:50.710
like the Golden Record on Voyager,

08:50.710 --> 08:51.850
were heavily criticized.

08:51.850 --> 08:53.870
Well, aliens could only play the Golden Record

08:53.870 --> 08:56.020
if they figured out how to build a record player.

08:56.020 --> 08:59.310
Although, to be fair, I watched E.T. build a telephone

08:59.310 --> 09:02.310
out of a Speak & Spell and an umbrella.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.820
Dude was like a little brown MacGyver.

09:05.550 --> 09:07.840
That would be more helpful if E.T. were real.

09:07.840 --> 09:12.390
Well, my feelings were real when he was about to die.

09:13.610 --> 09:17.020
My God, when he's on the table and they use the paddles on him.

09:17.020 --> 09:18.320
And he's all white.

09:18.320 --> 09:20.440
They zip him up in that bag.

09:20.440 --> 09:22.670
And Gertie can't stop crying.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.260
The flower dies.

09:26.060 --> 09:28.630
- Okay, let's talk about something else.- All right.

09:28.630 --> 09:32.060
So it-it sounds like we need a way to communicate that's simple.

09:32.060 --> 09:34.040
And doesn't require outside machinery

09:34.040 --> 09:35.180
to be built to access it.

09:35.180 --> 09:37.230
It's also a problem because we don't even know

09:37.230 --> 09:39.250
if the aliens who find this can see.

09:39.250 --> 09:40.310
I mean, they might communicate

09:40.310 --> 09:42.220
in a totally different way than us.

09:42.220 --> 09:43.990
Like when my dog is mad at me,

09:43.990 --> 09:46.700
she tells me by peeing in my slippers.

09:47.760 --> 09:50.270
That's actually a valid example.

09:50.270 --> 09:53.080
Animals do deliver messages through scent.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.990
Bees talk to each other by dancing.

09:54.990 --> 09:56.160
Whales have their songs.

09:56.160 --> 09:58.620
Penny has about 20 different ways of rolling her eyes

09:58.620 --> 10:00.560
that each mean something different.

10:01.160 --> 10:03.240
Okay, so, what it sounds like is,

10:03.240 --> 10:04.530
what we want is a device

10:04.530 --> 10:06.500
that can deliver a message through not only sight,

10:06.500 --> 10:08.050
but other senses, as well.

10:08.050 --> 10:11.610
The most basic sense that any space-faring civilization

10:11.610 --> 10:14.050
would have to possess is touch.

10:15.350 --> 10:17.720
We could make a video-playing device

10:17.720 --> 10:20.230
that simultaneously translates the information

10:20.230 --> 10:21.520
into a tactile medium.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.200
All we have to do is rig up a 3-D communication system!

10:24.200 --> 10:25.490
We-we can totally do that!

10:25.490 --> 10:26.170
I know!

10:26.170 --> 10:26.820
This is great!

10:26.820 --> 10:27.920
- Yeah, you know what else it is? - What?

10:27.920 --> 10:30.590
Exactly what Sheldon and Howard said.

10:32.730 --> 10:35.600
Well, thank you for peeing in my slippers.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.790
It's the eye of the tiger

10:42.790 --> 10:44.510
It's the ear of the bat

10:44.510 --> 10:46.850
It's the whiskers of the catfish

10:46.850 --> 10:49.630
And the walrus...

10:50.690 --> 10:54.940
Hang on. Not that your song isn't terrible-- it is...

10:55.960 --> 10:59.270
...but how do you mention bats and leave out sonar?

10:59.270 --> 11:00.970
You didn't let me finish.

11:00.970 --> 11:05.190
And also regarding the bat

11:05.190 --> 11:07.870
It has sonar.

11:10.240 --> 11:11.250
Hello.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.310
Look,

11:14.130 --> 11:17.280
I know you guys are upset, but we've talked about it,

11:17.280 --> 11:18.800
and we think it'd be beneficial

11:18.800 --> 11:20.800
for you to be part of the project.

11:21.300 --> 11:25.180
Well, well, well, did you hear that, Sheldon?

11:25.180 --> 11:27.240
I'm sorry. I was trying to think of what rhymes

11:27.240 --> 11:29.310
with "Nose of the aardvark."

11:31.000 --> 11:33.110
We want you back on the project with us.

11:33.110 --> 11:39.000
Well, well, well, did you hear that, Howard?

11:39.000 --> 11:39.700
Look, we admit it.

11:39.700 --> 11:42.400
The idea that you guys came up with was really good,

11:42.400 --> 11:44.560
and I'd love your help.

11:44.560 --> 11:47.140
I suppose it couldn't have been easy for you to say that.

11:47.140 --> 11:51.390
It wasn't, so... are you in?

11:51.970 --> 11:53.000
- Certainly. - Sure.

11:53.000 --> 11:53.900
Great.

11:53.900 --> 11:55.500
Now that we're all on the same page,

11:55.500 --> 11:57.330
let's get together tonight and work on it.

11:57.330 --> 11:58.540
"Get together tonight"?

11:58.540 --> 12:00.630
Leonard, stop trying to control everything,

12:00.630 --> 12:03.110
and give poor Raj a chance to come up with what we should do.

12:03.110 --> 12:04.170
Go ahead, Raj.

12:04.170 --> 12:05.860
Okay, I think we should do it right now.

12:05.860 --> 12:08.310
- Tonight works better for me. - Okay.

12:15.210 --> 12:17.900
Okay, it's just an audition.

12:17.900 --> 12:19.480
Why am I nervous?

12:19.480 --> 12:20.860
Maybe it's a good thing.

12:20.860 --> 12:22.590
Just means I want it.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.790
And I can have it.

12:24.790 --> 12:25.890
This feels right.

12:25.890 --> 12:28.660
Why did I ever give this up?

12:33.010 --> 12:35.470
I'm starting to remember.

12:37.700 --> 12:39.910
So, I'd like to try a technique

12:39.910 --> 12:42.370
where no one gets steamrolled.

12:42.610 --> 12:43.540
When you talk,

12:43.540 --> 12:45.300
instead of bringing up a new idea,

12:45.300 --> 12:48.620
respect what was just said by building on it.

12:48.620 --> 12:51.060
Uh, building on that...

12:51.060 --> 12:53.420
...we should order dinner.

12:53.760 --> 12:55.420
How is that building on what he just said?

12:55.420 --> 12:59.520
Building on what Sheldon said, I could go for Chinese.

12:59.520 --> 13:01.190
Hang on. Building on what Leonard said,

13:01.190 --> 13:02.650
no one built on what I said.

13:02.650 --> 13:04.370
Building on "building on that,"

13:04.370 --> 13:07.310
there's a new build-your-own pizza place on Colorado.

13:07.900 --> 13:09.360
Building on that, I'd like to remind you,

13:09.360 --> 13:10.520
I'm lactose intolerant.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.050
I saw the menu. They have soy cheese.

13:12.520 --> 13:14.720
You didn't say "building on." You're out!

13:14.720 --> 13:15.930
It's not Simon Says.

13:15.930 --> 13:17.040
Yeah, you're missing the point, Sheldon.

13:17.040 --> 13:17.970
You're out, and you're out.

13:17.970 --> 13:20.120
I win! Who wants pizza?

13:24.270 --> 13:25.480
Penny?

13:27.110 --> 13:28.760
I haven't seen you auditioning in a while.

13:28.760 --> 13:31.510
Yeah, uh, I got a job as a pharmaceutical sales rep.

13:31.510 --> 13:32.640
You quit acting?

13:32.640 --> 13:33.650
Well, kind of.

13:33.650 --> 13:34.680
But now I get to act like

13:34.680 --> 13:38.280
inflamed heart is only a "Mild side effect."

13:39.350 --> 13:41.240
I heard you can make good money doing that.

13:41.240 --> 13:44.650
Yeah, it's going okay, but I do miss this sometimes.

13:44.650 --> 13:45.780
Really?

13:45.780 --> 13:48.990
'Cause I got to tell you, I am so sick of the humiliation

13:48.990 --> 13:51.020
and being treated like a piece of meat.

13:51.020 --> 13:51.960
Chelsea?

13:52.340 --> 13:53.950
Wish me luck.

13:56.300 --> 13:57.970
They're gonna love you.

13:58.600 --> 14:02.050
I heard she's pushing 40 and everything's fake.

14:02.790 --> 14:06.050
Yeah. I started that rumor.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.830
Okay, since we agree on the delivery system for the message,

14:10.830 --> 14:13.390
maybe we should talk about what the message could be.

14:13.390 --> 14:16.010
Well, I think we should show what earthlings look like.

14:16.010 --> 14:17.820
The plaque they sent up on the Pioneer probe

14:17.820 --> 14:19.860
had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.590
Yeah, I never cared for that.

14:21.590 --> 14:24.110
It's advertising to predator races

14:24.110 --> 14:28.040
just how soft and squishy we are.

14:28.040 --> 14:29.420
Squeeze yourself!

14:29.420 --> 14:31.250
Oh, don't be offended.

14:31.250 --> 14:32.560
You know, of the four of us,

14:32.560 --> 14:35.740
you have the most veal-like consistency.

14:36.320 --> 14:38.920
Well, maybe there's a way to appear nonaggressive,

14:38.920 --> 14:41.540
but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary.

14:41.540 --> 14:43.980
Like smiling and waving with one hand,

14:43.980 --> 14:47.490
but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.770
You want to send a passive-aggressive message

14:49.770 --> 14:50.840
out into the universe?

14:50.840 --> 14:51.870
That's ridiculous.

14:51.870 --> 14:53.530
Oh, you mean passive-aggressive

14:53.530 --> 14:55.000
like posting pictures of you and your wife

14:55.000 --> 14:58.950
eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?

15:00.750 --> 15:03.190
Perhaps Howard meant passive-aggressive

15:03.190 --> 15:05.740
like asking our group to help on your project,

15:05.740 --> 15:08.070
and then only choosing Leonard.

15:08.070 --> 15:10.560
Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings,

15:10.560 --> 15:12.790
but you do have strong personalities

15:12.790 --> 15:14.630
and always end up taking over.

15:14.630 --> 15:16.160
It's not always.

15:16.160 --> 15:17.830
What about when we went to Comic-Con

15:17.830 --> 15:19.450
and dressed like Jabba the Hutt?

15:19.450 --> 15:20.880
You got to be Jabba's head,

15:20.880 --> 15:24.100
and I got to be his fat slug butt.

15:25.450 --> 15:27.340
We looked great.

15:28.470 --> 15:30.710
You let a guy sit on me.

15:30.710 --> 15:32.640
He was dressed as Princess Leia.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.210
It made a nice picture.

15:36.310 --> 15:39.550
I'm just saying, sometimes Raj and I feel pushed aside.

15:39.550 --> 15:41.900
Yeah. Like when you took Sheldon to Texas

15:41.900 --> 15:43.650
and showed him all around NASA--

15:43.650 --> 15:45.690
you didn't even think to ask me and Leonard.

15:46.380 --> 15:47.530
You know what? You're right.

15:48.170 --> 15:49.490
I should have asked you.

15:49.490 --> 15:51.690
Yeah, and if he does ask you, go.

15:51.690 --> 15:53.430
It's amazing.

15:54.850 --> 15:57.260
Okay, and if we're talking about being left out of things,

15:57.260 --> 15:59.520
you guys went to Skywalker Ranch without us.

15:59.520 --> 16:00.980
Oh, I recommend that, too.

16:00.980 --> 16:03.420
That was a magical experience!

16:03.990 --> 16:04.600
Wait a minute.

16:04.600 --> 16:07.070
Sheldon spent a whole day with James Earl Jones

16:07.070 --> 16:08.510
and never told any of us.

16:08.510 --> 16:09.920
I sure did.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.660
Oh, my goodness!

16:11.660 --> 16:14.860
Well, from Jabba's head to ice cream with Darth Vader,

16:14.860 --> 16:17.180
I'm having a heck of a ride.

16:17.180 --> 16:18.110
Yeah, look,

16:18.110 --> 16:21.370
clearly, good things happen when I'm in charge.

16:21.370 --> 16:23.440
Now, why don't you boys step aside,

16:23.440 --> 16:25.300
let me knock this project out?

16:25.610 --> 16:26.870
Sheldon, you're not in charge.

16:26.870 --> 16:28.180
Raj is in charge.

16:28.180 --> 16:30.730
Leonard, who's really in charge?

16:30.730 --> 16:35.610
The person in charge, or those who put him in charge?

16:35.610 --> 16:36.870
He's right.

16:36.870 --> 16:39.060
If you think about it, we're all in charge.

16:39.060 --> 16:40.550
No, the guy in charge is in...

16:40.550 --> 16:43.190
Why is everyone so bad at these?!

16:44.860 --> 16:46.340
I mean, the whole experience reminded me

16:46.340 --> 16:48.130
about how much I hated about that world.

16:48.130 --> 16:51.740
You-you know, the anxiety, the depression, the negativity.

16:51.740 --> 16:53.180
I don't want to feel those things.

16:53.180 --> 16:56.900
I want to sell drugs to people who feel those things.

16:57.950 --> 16:59.750
I can't believe you got up and walked out

16:59.750 --> 17:01.840
of an audition for a big movie.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.040
I did.

17:03.040 --> 17:04.930
I-I mean, I walked in, read for the part,

17:04.930 --> 17:07.830
then stunk up the place, but then I walked right out.

17:09.140 --> 17:11.480
Well, I'm glad you have a new appreciation for your job.

17:11.550 --> 17:12.720
I do, and you know, I don't think

17:12.720 --> 17:15.740
I've ever thanked you properly for helping me get it.

17:15.740 --> 17:17.280
Properly, at all.

17:17.280 --> 17:20.030
It's just words I've never heard.

17:20.490 --> 17:21.220
Well, thank you.

17:21.220 --> 17:23.540
You're a good friend, and you changed my life.

17:23.540 --> 17:25.090
You're welcome.

17:25.090 --> 17:26.760
Hey, now that you're making some real money,

17:26.760 --> 17:29.690
maybe you can take your friend out for a nice thank-you dinner.

17:30.380 --> 17:31.440
Sure.

17:31.440 --> 17:33.300
And you probably have to invite your other friend

17:33.300 --> 17:34.810
'cause she overheard you talking about it,

17:34.810 --> 17:37.370
and it would be awkward to exclude her.

17:37.960 --> 17:39.000
Okay.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.540
How about now?

17:41.090 --> 17:42.660
All right.

17:45.010 --> 17:45.880
Don't forget your wallet.

17:45.880 --> 17:46.870
I...

17:56.580 --> 17:58.650
Greetings from planet Earth.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.770
Just turn left at Alpha Centauri.

18:02.770 --> 18:04.680
You can't miss it.
