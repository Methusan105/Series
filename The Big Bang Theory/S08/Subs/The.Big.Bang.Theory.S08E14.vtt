00:03.450 --> 00:04.710
So, tell me about your day...

00:04.750 --> 00:06.720
how's it going with the particle detector?

00:07.070 --> 00:08.690
Wow! You remember that?

00:08.690 --> 00:10.440
Yeah, I listen to what you say.

00:10.450 --> 00:11.700
You're building a particle detector

00:11.700 --> 00:13.580
using superfluid helium.

00:14.220 --> 00:15.440
You know, when you talk like that,

00:15.440 --> 00:17.870
I want to take you right here on this table.

00:18.820 --> 00:20.130
And you know from past experience

00:20.130 --> 00:22.710
this table cannot support both our weight.

00:23.390 --> 00:25.330
So, how's the detector going?

00:25.330 --> 00:27.940
Well, it's tricky working with superfluids.

00:27.940 --> 00:29.240
Whatever container you put them in,

00:29.240 --> 00:30.770
they kind of creep up the sides

00:30.770 --> 00:32.460
and crawl out all on their own.

00:32.460 --> 00:34.130
Kind of like Sheldon's ant farm.

00:34.900 --> 00:37.430
Exactly, except you don't have a lunatic running around,

00:37.430 --> 00:40.230
yelling, "I fed you sugar water, why are you biting me?"

00:42.160 --> 00:44.050
Come on, this is boring-- you really want to talk about this?

00:44.050 --> 00:44.730
No, I do.

00:44.730 --> 00:46.670
I-I didn't write "superfluid helium"

00:46.670 --> 00:47.950
on this napkin for nothing.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.740
Okay, well...

00:51.080 --> 00:51.700
This is cool.

00:51.700 --> 00:54.210
Uh, there's a thing called "superfluid vacuum theory",

00:54.210 --> 00:56.240
where empty space is imagined as a superfluid

00:56.240 --> 00:57.810
with all of its qualities--

00:57.810 --> 01:00.030
viscosity, density, surface tension...

01:03.020 --> 01:04.590
Hey, if you're pausing for dramatic effect,

01:04.590 --> 01:06.500
I'd keep it moving.

01:07.570 --> 01:09.200
No, no.

01:10.450 --> 01:13.880
People don't talk about surface tension.

01:13.880 --> 01:17.260
If you imagine our three-space as the surface

01:17.260 --> 01:19.980
of an N-dimensional superfluid bubble...

01:19.990 --> 01:22.480
This... is exciting.

01:23.170 --> 01:24.240
This is really exciting.

01:24.240 --> 01:25.920
I have to go find Sheldon.

01:26.280 --> 01:28.310
Okay, well, if you find him,

01:28.310 --> 01:29.590
use the kitchen island--

01:29.590 --> 01:32.310
that coffee table will not support both of you.

01:34.790 --> 01:37.410
Which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid

01:37.410 --> 01:39.850
shows the same negative-energy density as space-time.

01:39.850 --> 01:42.090
So what do you think? What do you think? So what do you think?

01:48.410 --> 01:49.810
What? Is it wrong?

01:49.810 --> 01:51.590
Have you seen it somewhere else?

01:56.220 --> 01:57.680
I know this isn't my area,

01:57.680 --> 01:59.280
and I could never do the math like you can,

01:59.280 --> 02:01.430
but could this be something...?

02:01.430 --> 02:03.540
Well...

02:04.350 --> 02:08.140
You could have set Newton's gravitational constant to one.

02:08.140 --> 02:10.540
And, ugh, the whole thing reeks of blueberry.

02:10.540 --> 02:13.270
You know I can't stand these scented markers.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.660
No one told you to taste them.

02:17.700 --> 02:20.650
Come on, is-is this good or not?

02:22.210 --> 02:23.190
It's good.

02:23.190 --> 02:24.700
- Really? - I like it.

02:24.710 --> 02:25.980
I think you're on to something.

02:25.980 --> 02:27.250
You do? You're not messing with me?

02:27.260 --> 02:28.730
Not at all.

02:28.730 --> 02:31.020
In fact, I have got something

02:31.020 --> 02:32.240
for just such an occasion.

02:32.240 --> 02:33.390
I was starting to think

02:33.390 --> 02:35.370
I might never get a chance to give it to you.

02:36.240 --> 02:37.280
Good job.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.430
You're giving me a sticker?

02:43.430 --> 02:44.320
Indeed.

02:44.450 --> 02:46.330
Not just a sticker.

02:46.480 --> 02:50.100
That is a sticker of a kitty saying, "Me-wow!"

02:52.840 --> 02:54.530
I'm not a preschooler.

02:54.690 --> 02:56.030
Fine, I'll take it back.

02:56.030 --> 02:57.940
I earned this! Back off!

03:25.690 --> 03:27.390
You're still awake?

03:27.860 --> 03:30.190
For a man whose last observation was

03:30.190 --> 03:31.770
our universe may be the surface

03:31.770 --> 03:34.050
of a multidimensional supercooled liquid,

03:34.050 --> 03:37.100
"You're still awake" seems like quite the sophomore slump.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.880
You worked out all the math.

03:40.880 --> 03:43.490
Oh, I did more than work out all the math.

03:43.490 --> 03:45.780
I wrote a paper.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.070
You wrote a paper on my idea?

03:49.170 --> 03:51.380
I wrote a paper on our idea.

03:52.130 --> 03:54.730
When did my idea become our idea?

03:54.740 --> 03:57.120
When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness

03:57.120 --> 04:00.760
and cooked it in the Easy-Bake Oven of my mind.

04:02.880 --> 04:03.880
This is good.

04:04.590 --> 04:06.270
Our idea is really good.

04:06.270 --> 04:10.610
Well, the lightbulb in this oven is ridiculously bright.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.500
You know, if no one's thought of this, yet,

04:13.500 --> 04:15.370
this could be a big deal.

04:15.440 --> 04:16.730
Only way we'll know for sure is

04:16.730 --> 04:19.090
if we post it online to the pre-print server.

04:19.110 --> 04:22.550
I have it ready to go, but I wasn't gonna do it without you.

04:24.690 --> 04:27.040
Wow, it's all happening so fast.

04:28.220 --> 04:29.690
Should we just sleep on it?

04:29.870 --> 04:32.060
We could, but we always run the risk

04:32.060 --> 04:34.120
of someone else beating us to the punch.

04:35.360 --> 04:36.620
You're sure it's good?

04:36.730 --> 04:38.990
My name is right on there with yours.

04:39.360 --> 04:42.000
That is a surefire mark of quality.

04:44.170 --> 04:47.780
That might as well say "Directed by Joss Whedon".

04:49.880 --> 04:51.380
Okay, partner, let's do it.

04:54.090 --> 04:54.930
Come on.

04:55.780 --> 04:57.060
Click the mouse with me.

05:01.220 --> 05:02.210
One...

05:03.200 --> 05:04.220
two...

05:04.690 --> 05:05.780
three...

05:05.960 --> 05:06.930
Click.

05:11.030 --> 05:11.970
Well, we did it.

05:12.750 --> 05:14.310
Yes, we did, my friend.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.420
Is your tongue blue?

05:15.420 --> 05:16.840
I don't want to talk about it.

05:19.260 --> 05:20.910
Okay, movie night-- what do you want to watch?

05:20.910 --> 05:22.890
Whatever happened to that ape movie you were in?

05:22.900 --> 05:24.170
Oh, God.

05:24.170 --> 05:25.030
Probably nothing.

05:25.040 --> 05:28.920
I think I saw the director twirling a sign outside the Verizon store.

05:29.870 --> 05:30.690
Search for it.

05:30.690 --> 05:32.360
Wha... no. No! Why?

05:32.360 --> 05:33.780
'Cause it would be fun to watch.

05:33.780 --> 05:35.400
It would be humiliating.

05:35.410 --> 05:37.120
Well, now we have two reasons.

05:39.150 --> 05:40.190
They have it.

05:40.670 --> 05:41.890
Please, can we watch it?

05:41.890 --> 05:42.840
Please?

05:42.840 --> 05:45.150
Fine, but I'm telling you-- it's terrible.

05:45.610 --> 05:47.400
- Have you even seen it? - No.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.390
Well, maybe it turned out better than you think.

05:49.660 --> 05:52.230
Bananas, get your fresh bananas.

05:53.330 --> 05:55.170
It really didn't.

05:59.680 --> 06:03.330
Sheldon, this is superfluid helium.

06:03.910 --> 06:04.700
Put this in your mouth,

06:04.700 --> 06:06.800
your tongue will freeze and break off.

06:08.710 --> 06:10.370
Does it smell like blueberries?

06:11.730 --> 06:12.310
No.

06:12.320 --> 06:13.610
Then we're probably okay.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.050
Hey, your paper got mentioned

06:16.050 --> 06:17.960
on the Quantum Diaries physics blog.

06:18.380 --> 06:19.380
Really?

06:19.390 --> 06:20.470
Wh-What'd they say?

06:20.480 --> 06:22.270
Uh, it's basically a summary of the theory,

06:22.270 --> 06:24.050
but there's a bunch of positive comments on the message board.

06:24.060 --> 06:25.090
Let me see, let me see.

06:26.520 --> 06:29.440
One calls it "Insightful and innovative".

06:29.900 --> 06:31.410
We're insightful and innovative.

06:31.410 --> 06:33.990
Ooh, nice to meet you, Mr. Insightful.

06:33.990 --> 06:36.150
Oh, the pleasure is mine, Mr. Innovative.

06:37.510 --> 06:39.760
Uh, another one says, "The concept shows

06:39.760 --> 06:42.310
some real out-of-the-box thinking".

06:42.370 --> 06:44.030
Do you hear that, Mr. Out-Of-The?

06:44.030 --> 06:46.390
I do, indeed, Mr. Box-Thinking.

06:47.750 --> 06:48.570
How are you today,

06:48.570 --> 06:51.200
Mr. Can-You-Believe-These-Jack-Asses?

06:51.840 --> 06:53.620
Just dandy, Mr....

06:54.020 --> 06:56.750
I-Wish-I-Was-Better-At-Improv.

06:57.970 --> 07:00.290
Read another one. Okay, okay. Uh...

07:00.770 --> 07:02.610
"The analogy between space-time

07:02.610 --> 07:06.260
and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or... false".

07:06.940 --> 07:09.880
"I wish this blog would devote itself to real science

07:10.130 --> 07:11.920
Instead of wasting our time with crackpot,

07:11.920 --> 07:14.740
wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish".

07:14.990 --> 07:15.990
Who wrote that?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.540
It's anonymous,

07:17.580 --> 07:19.770
and user name "General Relativity."

07:20.300 --> 07:22.730
Well... I'm responding to it.

07:22.740 --> 07:25.000
Uh, don't lower yourself to their level.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.140
Look, I am simply going to defend our work,

07:27.140 --> 07:28.840
scientist to scientist.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.020
And failing that,

07:30.020 --> 07:31.950
suggest that his mother enjoys a string

07:31.950 --> 07:34.110
of both human and non-human lovers.

07:35.430 --> 07:37.750
Sheldon, my name's on that paper, too.

07:37.750 --> 07:39.350
There's no upside to doing this.

07:39.350 --> 07:41.020
He just left another comment.

07:41.020 --> 07:42.040
What does it say?

07:42.900 --> 07:45.360
"Upon review, I've changed my mind about

07:45.360 --> 07:47.260
The Cooper-Hofstadter hypothesis

07:47.260 --> 07:49.910
That space-time is like a superfluid. In fact,

07:49.910 --> 07:52.820
It's inspired me to come up with my own theory.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.860
Maybe space-time is like two clowns

07:54.860 --> 07:56.290
with their heads in a bucket,

07:56.290 --> 07:58.360
much like Cooper and Hofstadter."

08:00.580 --> 08:02.060
Can I respond now?

08:02.630 --> 08:03.510
Do it.

08:03.660 --> 08:06.490
You mess with the bull, you get the horns.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.570
I'm about to show this guy just how horny I can be.

08:15.110 --> 08:16.470
Somebody else do it.

08:19.520 --> 08:21.230
Doctor, please help me.

08:21.280 --> 08:24.000
I think I might be turning into a killer gorilla.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.660
Why do you think you're turning into a killer gorilla

08:27.670 --> 08:29.390
and not just a regular gorilla?

08:31.000 --> 08:33.320
Because regular gorillas are vegetarians,

08:33.320 --> 08:36.340
and I just bit the fingers off your receptionist!

08:36.780 --> 08:39.630
Okay, we've seen plenty.

08:39.640 --> 08:40.830
No! Give me the remote.

08:40.840 --> 08:42.660
Careful. She'll bite your fingers off.

08:44.090 --> 08:45.860
Okay, well, I've been poking around the internet,

08:45.860 --> 08:48.810
and I think I found something we'll enjoy watching even more.

08:48.810 --> 08:49.580
What is it?

08:49.580 --> 08:53.060
Oh, just a video of Bernadette in a beauty pageant.

08:53.350 --> 08:54.370
What?!

08:54.510 --> 08:55.600
Okay, I learned my lesson.

08:55.610 --> 08:57.260
Making fun of people is wrong!

08:59.000 --> 09:00.070
I haven't learned my lesson.

09:00.070 --> 09:01.290
Play it! Play it!

09:08.060 --> 09:11.450
Hi. I'm Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski

09:11.450 --> 09:15.690
from Yorba Linda, California.

09:16.720 --> 09:19.140
You look like a talking cupcake!

09:20.390 --> 09:21.390
And you should pick me

09:21.390 --> 09:24.910
for Miss California Quiznos 1999, because I want to...

09:24.910 --> 09:26.940
Tell you what I want, what I really really want

09:26.940 --> 09:28.960
I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want

09:28.960 --> 09:31.180
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna

09:31.180 --> 09:33.130
Really, really, really be

09:33.130 --> 09:38.180
Miss California Quiznos 1999!

09:41.350 --> 09:42.880
Play it again! Play it again!

09:48.810 --> 09:50.420
Did he respond yet?

09:51.360 --> 09:52.880
Hmm. No, not yet.

09:53.610 --> 09:55.530
Well, maybe we shouldn't have sunk to his level.

09:55.530 --> 09:56.850
It wasn't that bad.

09:56.850 --> 09:59.040
Read it back one more time.

09:59.430 --> 10:03.760
"My good sir, we are neither crackpots nor wannabes.

10:03.810 --> 10:06.520
In fact, we are experts in our fields.

10:06.520 --> 10:08.750
And while you hide behind your anonymity,

10:08.750 --> 10:10.820
We stand behind our paper.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.750
And later tonight, your mother".

10:17.160 --> 10:18.670
And you don't think that's too rough?

10:18.670 --> 10:20.830
We're just standing behind her.

10:22.030 --> 10:24.450
It's not like we're gonna say "boo" and scare her.

10:27.110 --> 10:29.990
How could you not tell us you were in beauty pageants?

10:29.990 --> 10:31.840
'Cause it's embarrassing.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.850
It is; it truly is.

10:36.470 --> 10:37.540
Yeah, well...

10:37.820 --> 10:38.800
Amy writes Little House

10:38.800 --> 10:40.060
on the Prairie fan fiction

10:40.060 --> 10:42.160
about herself and posts it on the Internet.

10:45.460 --> 10:46.780
No!

10:46.780 --> 10:49.170
Why? What did I do?!

10:50.060 --> 10:52.050
Sorry, I had to get the spotlight off me,

10:52.050 --> 10:54.870
and tearing down other women is part of my pageant training.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.520
Okay. We are reading that right now.

10:57.520 --> 10:58.770
No, please don't.

10:58.770 --> 11:00.540
We got embarrassed tonight. Come on.

11:00.540 --> 11:01.790
But it's personal.

11:01.790 --> 11:03.840
Why? Is it about you and Sheldon?

11:04.180 --> 11:05.280
No.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.940
Oh, my God, it's about her and Sheldon.

11:08.120 --> 11:09.850
It's not about me and Sheldon.

11:09.850 --> 11:13.690
It's about a young woman in the 1800s named Amelia...

11:14.440 --> 11:16.550
and the time-traveling physicist named Cooper

11:16.560 --> 11:17.760
she falls in love with.

11:18.220 --> 11:20.500
- Please show us? - Please?

11:20.500 --> 11:23.070
- No. - You know I'm gonna read it either way.

11:23.070 --> 11:24.630
Good luck finding it.

11:25.550 --> 11:27.630
Amelia and...

11:27.630 --> 11:29.430
the time-trav...

11:29.430 --> 11:30.360
Found it!

11:32.350 --> 11:34.310
"It was just past dawn on the prairie,

11:34.310 --> 11:35.390
and like every morning,

11:35.390 --> 11:37.450
Amelia prepared to do her chores.

11:37.450 --> 11:40.350
Except something about this morning felt different."

11:40.350 --> 11:41.630
Why?

11:43.960 --> 11:46.350
Why did it feel different?

11:48.090 --> 11:50.790
"Maybe it was the first whisper of winter in the air,

11:50.790 --> 11:53.360
o maybe it was the unconscious handsome man

11:53.360 --> 11:55.310
with porcelain skin and curious clothing

11:55.310 --> 11:57.960
she was about to discover lying in the field.

11:57.960 --> 12:00.850
A man who would open her mind to new possibilities

12:00.870 --> 12:03.870
and her body to new feelings."

12:10.610 --> 12:13.760
You know, there was a time when I was alone and had no friends.

12:14.250 --> 12:15.640
I'm starting to miss that.

12:18.860 --> 12:20.860
He still hasn't responded.

12:20.860 --> 12:22.160
What's taking him so long?

12:22.160 --> 12:23.800
Do you really want him to write back?

12:23.800 --> 12:26.330
Yeah, I do. No matter how he responds,

12:26.330 --> 12:30.310
I am going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat

12:30.310 --> 12:33.300
saying, "Oh, really?"

12:38.120 --> 12:39.090
Me-wow.

12:42.060 --> 12:43.000
What are you doing?

12:43.110 --> 12:45.600
I've, uh, created some other user accounts

12:45.600 --> 12:48.270
so I can post positive comments about their paper.

12:48.270 --> 12:51.140
"This wee li'l bairn of a theory

12:51.140 --> 12:53.020
nearly blew my kilt off"?

12:53.020 --> 12:56.390
No. You have to read it how Dr. Angus McDoogal

12:56.390 --> 12:58.980
of the University of Edinburgh would.

12:59.140 --> 13:00.920
"This wee li'l bairn of a theory

13:00.920 --> 13:02.770
nearly blew me kilt off."

13:05.860 --> 13:07.160
He wrote back!

13:07.470 --> 13:11.580
"Cooper and Hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humor

13:11.580 --> 13:15.160
Is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper.

13:15.160 --> 13:16.720
It should come as no surprise

13:16.720 --> 13:20.380
Given they work at Cal Tech, essentially a technical school,

13:20.380 --> 13:23.880
where even the physicists are basically engineers."

13:24.150 --> 13:26.100
"Engineers"!

13:27.640 --> 13:30.420
Do you know how insulting that is?

13:31.130 --> 13:32.020
Yes.

13:33.530 --> 13:35.630
Guys, this person's just going out of their way

13:35.630 --> 13:36.900
to get a rise out of you.

13:36.910 --> 13:38.740
Yeah, but it's still so aggravating.

13:38.750 --> 13:41.120
Yeah, well, all the other comments said really nice things.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.880
- Focus on those. - Yeah.

13:42.880 --> 13:47.640
Dr. Dmitri Plancovik of Moscow University said,

13:47.950 --> 13:49.150
"Dis paper great.

13:49.160 --> 13:51.200
I love it more than 'wodka.".

13:53.580 --> 13:55.560
See? Better with the accent.

13:56.650 --> 13:58.690
And... send.

13:58.830 --> 13:59.750
What did you write?

13:59.750 --> 14:01.370
I'm done hiding from bullies.

14:01.380 --> 14:03.100
I'm taking this into the real world.

14:03.100 --> 14:03.860
What does that mean?

14:03.860 --> 14:05.800
I told him we'll meet him face-to-face

14:05.810 --> 14:07.140
anytime, anywhere.

14:07.140 --> 14:09.150
Are you crazy? You don't know who this person is.

14:09.150 --> 14:10.730
- Delete that! - Come on, Sheldon!

14:10.730 --> 14:13.120
Oh, okay, okay, calm down.

14:16.040 --> 14:17.050
It's him!

14:17.620 --> 14:19.360
He's trying to video chat.

14:23.600 --> 14:26.000
Perhaps I shouldn't have taken this into the real world.

14:27.120 --> 14:29.150
Oh, really?

14:31.730 --> 14:34.430
'"Time travel? I don't understand,' "Said Amelia.

14:34.430 --> 14:35.750
Cooper stared at her.

14:35.750 --> 14:38.740
'Which rd don't you understand, time or travel?'"

14:39.830 --> 14:43.340
Wow, even in your fantasies Sheldon's kind of exhausting.

14:44.990 --> 14:46.400
He's like that in the beginning,

14:46.400 --> 14:48.060
so she can change him.

14:48.060 --> 14:49.590
It's called good writing.

14:50.880 --> 14:52.280
And wishful thinking.

14:53.690 --> 14:54.830
"It stung Amelia "

14:54.830 --> 14:55.960
When he spoke to her this way.

14:55.960 --> 14:57.390
In her little one-room schoolhouse,

14:57.390 --> 14:58.980
she was always the smartest student,

14:58.980 --> 15:01.140
regularly besting the boys in her class,

15:01.140 --> 15:02.960
but this was no boy in front of her--

15:02.960 --> 15:04.240
"This was a man.

15:04.240 --> 15:05.070
Here we go.

15:06.450 --> 15:07.470
"Cooper told Amelia

15:07.470 --> 15:09.120
about all the strange and incredible things

15:09.120 --> 15:10.860
the future would hold, like computers

15:10.860 --> 15:12.350
and living past 30.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.970
He asked her if she had any questions.

15:14.980 --> 15:16.240
All she longed to ask was

15:16.240 --> 15:18.540
if his heart was beating as fast as hers,

15:18.540 --> 15:20.960
but she was too afraid to hear the answer."

15:21.110 --> 15:22.390
Oh, Amelia.

15:22.390 --> 15:24.330
"So instead she asked if, in the future,

15:24.330 --> 15:26.660
montana ever became a state."

15:31.100 --> 15:33.660
In the 1800s that was considered flirting.

15:36.470 --> 15:39.630
I'm so sick of people being mean on the Internet.

15:39.880 --> 15:42.430
Well, I think the anonymity makes everyone feel like

15:42.430 --> 15:45.060
they can say things they'd never say to your face.

15:45.750 --> 15:46.900
Interesting.

15:47.510 --> 15:48.830
I can't think of a single thing

15:48.830 --> 15:50.740
I wouldn't say to someone's face.

15:52.850 --> 15:54.740
Never noticed that about you.

15:56.470 --> 15:59.360
You know what? A-At least you guys did something.

15:59.860 --> 16:01.490
You know, you-you had a theory,

16:01.490 --> 16:02.280
you wrote a paper,

16:02.280 --> 16:04.810
you made an actual contribution.

16:04.890 --> 16:08.490
All guys like this do is just stand on other people's work.

16:09.670 --> 16:10.690
He's right.

16:12.540 --> 16:14.980
I say we call this person back.

16:15.480 --> 16:17.210
We've got no reason to hide.

16:19.410 --> 16:21.360
All right, do it. Call him.

16:21.490 --> 16:23.870
Let's find out what this loser's ever accomplished.

16:27.660 --> 16:28.800
Click it with me.

16:30.730 --> 16:32.480
One, two, three...

16:32.480 --> 16:33.580
- Click. - Click.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.080
Well, hello there.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.760
Professor Hawking?

16:40.880 --> 16:44.520
Oh, brother, you should see the look on your faces.

16:47.020 --> 16:49.030
You really didn't like our paper?

16:49.070 --> 16:51.590
I like your paper very much.

16:51.820 --> 16:54.160
The premise is intriguing.

16:54.700 --> 16:56.900
Then why are you attacking us?

16:56.960 --> 17:00.170
If you were sitting in a chair for 40 years,

17:00.170 --> 17:01.990
you'd get bored, too.

17:04.580 --> 17:05.540
Anyway,

17:05.540 --> 17:06.530
got to go.

17:06.530 --> 17:10.670
I promised to help the neighbor kid with his math homework.

17:12.090 --> 17:13.040
Ciao.

17:16.730 --> 17:19.010
Stephen Hawking liked our paper.

17:20.460 --> 17:22.770
Said the premise is intriguing.

17:23.850 --> 17:25.250
Good to see you again,

17:25.250 --> 17:27.480
Mr. Stephen-Hawking-Liked-Our-Paper.

17:29.950 --> 17:33.030
And you as well, Mr. Our-Premise-Is-Intriguing.

17:34.400 --> 17:37.540
How do you do, Mr. I'll- Admit-That's-Pretty-Cool?

17:39.380 --> 17:41.580
Yeah, you keep setting me up for failure.

17:45.050 --> 17:45.950
"With a heavy heart,

17:45.950 --> 17:48.580
Amelia stood before the newly repaired time machine.

17:48.580 --> 17:51.140
She regretted giving Cooper the part he needed."

17:51.140 --> 17:54.340
Because she wanted him to give her the part she needed.

17:56.460 --> 17:57.770
- Okay, that's enough. - What?

17:57.770 --> 18:00.360
No! I really want to know what happens--

18:00.360 --> 18:01.040
and Bernadette

18:01.040 --> 18:03.420
really, really, really wants to know what happens.

18:05.300 --> 18:06.960
You're just making fun of me.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.660
I was just kidding. I'm sorry.

18:08.660 --> 18:10.140
And the story's really good!

18:10.140 --> 18:12.110
No, it is! Does he stay?

18:12.110 --> 18:15.070
Do they kiss? Does she find out about Montana?

18:16.930 --> 18:17.980
Please?

18:18.810 --> 18:19.680
Fine.

18:22.020 --> 18:24.170
"As Cooper prepared to depart,

18:24.190 --> 18:26.420
Tears filled Amelia's eyes.

18:27.040 --> 18:30.760
he took her hand in his and said, 'I can't stay,

18:30.800 --> 18:32.610
but I will never forget you.'

18:33.150 --> 18:35.470
He brushed his fingers against her cheek,

18:35.540 --> 18:37.650
then quickly stepped into the machine.

18:38.250 --> 18:40.430
'Please don't go,' she whispered.

18:40.840 --> 18:42.330
But it was too late.

18:42.340 --> 18:44.280
The engine hummed to life."

18:44.630 --> 18:46.410
But they didn't even kiss.

18:47.140 --> 18:48.410
"She turned away,

18:48.410 --> 18:49.820
wiping her eyes.

18:50.190 --> 18:51.450
She couldn't bear to watch

18:51.450 --> 18:54.530
her one chance at true love disappear forever.

18:54.920 --> 18:55.530
Then...

18:55.530 --> 18:57.710
she felt a strong hand on her shoulder

18:57.710 --> 18:59.220
spin her around.

18:59.490 --> 19:00.880
it was Cooper."

19:01.470 --> 19:02.600
Yes!

19:05.130 --> 19:07.330
"'What about the future?' asked Amelia.

19:07.800 --> 19:10.430
He looked deeply into her eyes and whispered,

19:10.750 --> 19:13.140
'There is no future without you.'

19:13.840 --> 19:15.480
He pulled her in close.

19:15.930 --> 19:18.200
She began to tremble all over.

19:18.920 --> 19:20.600
She felt his warm breath..."

19:20.600 --> 19:22.080
You will not believe what Stephen Hawking just said.

19:22.080 --> 19:24.010
- Get out!  - Not now!

19:34.960 --> 19:37.370
Is the water warm enough?

19:37.770 --> 19:41.110
Given the fact that you took the time to build a wood fire,

19:41.110 --> 19:43.490
draw the water from the well and heat it,

19:43.490 --> 19:46.220
it would be rude to complain.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.920
But since you asked, it's a little nippy.

19:51.350 --> 19:53.300
I can fix that.

19:58.350 --> 20:02.670
I couldn't help but notice your unusual undergarments.

20:03.170 --> 20:04.820
They're not undergarments.

20:04.860 --> 20:07.300
They're Underoos.

20:08.570 --> 20:10.650
Where I come from, they're known as

20:10.660 --> 20:13.240
"Underwear that's fun to wear."

20:14.920 --> 20:18.120
And what's the significance of the spider?

20:18.120 --> 20:20.940
Oh, that represents Spider-Man.

20:20.940 --> 20:23.600
He does whatever a spider can.

20:26.200 --> 20:28.840
There's a lot of rhyming in the future, isn't there?

20:29.620 --> 20:30.650
You're right.

20:30.650 --> 20:33.510
This is even weirder than I thought.

20:33.900 --> 20:34.960
You want me to stop reading?

20:34.960 --> 20:37.050
Are you kidding? No, no.

20:38.360 --> 20:41.440
"As he stood for Amelia to dry him..."

20:46.270 --> 20:47.650
So, tell me, Cooper...

20:48.820 --> 20:52.960
are the ways of physical love different in the future?

20:52.960 --> 20:54.270
Yeah, okay, I'm good.
