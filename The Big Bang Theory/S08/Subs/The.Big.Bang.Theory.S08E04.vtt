00:03.530 --> 00:05.610
Have you guys heard about this research team

00:05.610 --> 00:08.540
that's trying to genetically manipulate Chicken DNA

00:08.540 --> 00:10.870
to create some sort of a chicken dinosaur?

00:11.490 --> 00:14.190
I think that sounds wonderful.

00:15.130 --> 00:18.490
What? You're afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens.

00:18.950 --> 00:20.350
Yes, but tell me

00:20.350 --> 00:21.990
a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich

00:21.990 --> 00:25.020
wouldn't hit the Mesozoic spot.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.100
- Hey, guys. - Hey. Hello.

00:29.100 --> 00:30.390
We still on for tomorrow night?

00:30.390 --> 00:32.230
Yeah. I'm excited to finally meet your girlfriend.

00:32.230 --> 00:34.090
Yeah, oh, and speaking of which.

00:34.090 --> 00:37.320
According to a recent study out of Oxford University,

00:37.320 --> 00:39.930
when someone takes on a new romantic partner,

00:39.930 --> 00:43.620
that person loses one or two close friends.

00:43.620 --> 00:46.130
Since when do you read social science?

00:46.130 --> 00:49.250
I go to the bathroom like everybody else.

00:49.730 --> 00:52.010
Why would I lose friends just because I started dating someone?

00:52.010 --> 00:53.820
Yeah, you didn't lose anyone when you met Amy.

00:53.820 --> 00:57.220
Yeah, well, no, the study refers to romantic partners.

00:57.730 --> 01:00.500
Not the way I would categorize the two of us.

01:00.500 --> 01:01.880
You guys kiss and hold hands.

01:01.880 --> 01:04.670
I've seen him do it. It's not romantic.

01:05.560 --> 01:06.850
Look, I'm not the kind of guy

01:06.850 --> 01:09.450
who drops his friends just because he's in a relationship.

01:09.450 --> 01:11.570
What happens if she doesn't like us?

01:11.570 --> 01:13.620
Well, hey, you're my dear friends.

01:13.620 --> 01:15.090
You'll get a Christmas card for a couple of years,

01:15.090 --> 01:17.710
and then you're dead to me.

01:44.670 --> 01:47.380
So, Howard, is Stuart still living with your mom?

01:47.380 --> 01:49.050
I don't want to talk about it.

01:49.050 --> 01:52.010
- But he's going to. - My mom got him cable!

01:52.420 --> 01:53.480
In my whole life,

01:53.480 --> 01:55.320
growing up in that house-- no cable.

01:55.320 --> 01:56.520
Do you know how many HBOs

01:56.520 --> 01:59.040
that leech had my mother get him? Seven.

01:59.040 --> 02:02.000
Seven HBOs. Seven!

02:02.410 --> 02:05.400
Long story short, they have seven HBOs.

02:06.700 --> 02:07.570
Hey, guys.

02:07.570 --> 02:08.250
Hello.

02:08.250 --> 02:10.100
- Emily, you know almost everybody here. - Hi.

02:10.100 --> 02:12.030
This is Leonard, this is Penny.

02:12.030 --> 02:13.120
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.

02:13.120 --> 02:15.210
- Nice to finally meet you, too. - Hi.

02:15.420 --> 02:16.410
Hello.

02:16.410 --> 02:18.470
Well, Raj, you were not lying about her.

02:18.470 --> 02:20.680
I told you she exists.

02:21.830 --> 02:23.560
Hey, I hear you're a dermatologist.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.210
Uh, yeah, I'm a resident at Huntington Hospital.

02:26.210 --> 02:29.340
Oh, I like their emergency room.

02:29.430 --> 02:32.100
Yeah, even if it turns out you don't have Dengue fever,

02:32.100 --> 02:34.390
they still let you take a lollipop.

02:35.850 --> 02:37.140
You know, Penny just started training

02:37.140 --> 02:38.930
to be a pharmaceutical sales rep.

02:38.930 --> 02:40.760
Maybe she can practice on you some time.

02:40.760 --> 02:43.410
Oh, it would be great to practice on a real doctor.

02:43.410 --> 02:45.370
Yeah. I'm sure that'd be fine.

02:45.700 --> 02:49.400
I have some odd freckles on my buttocks.

02:50.840 --> 02:54.220
Can I make an appointment for you to look at them?

02:54.910 --> 02:57.910
Um... okay, I guess.

02:58.990 --> 03:00.550
I'm with him three years, nothing.

03:00.550 --> 03:03.500
She's with two minutes, and he's taking his pants off.

03:08.470 --> 03:11.240
Last night was fun. What did you think of Emily?

03:11.240 --> 03:12.410
I don't know.

03:12.410 --> 03:14.450
I kind of got the sense she didn't like me.

03:14.450 --> 03:16.010
Did she say she didn't like you?

03:16.010 --> 03:17.060
Of course not. No one ever says

03:17.060 --> 03:19.000
they don't like you straight to your face.

03:19.530 --> 03:22.650
We have led different lives.

03:24.520 --> 03:27.090
You guys just met. Why would she feel that way?

03:27.090 --> 03:28.430
It's just this vibe I got.

03:28.430 --> 03:30.360
I'm sure you're worried about nothing.

03:30.360 --> 03:31.320
Yeah. You're probably right.

03:31.320 --> 03:33.510
I used to think my high school P.E. Teacher didn't like me,

03:33.510 --> 03:35.990
but it turned out, she liked me a little too much.

03:36.780 --> 03:37.750
- Really? - Yeah.

03:37.750 --> 03:38.400
It was fine.

03:38.400 --> 03:39.770
We went to a Melissa Etheridge concert,

03:39.770 --> 03:42.340
I got an A, it all worked out.

03:43.020 --> 03:45.860
When you go to Emily's office to practice, you'll see. It's fine.

03:45.860 --> 03:47.580
Yeah, I hope you're right.

03:47.580 --> 03:49.570
You really went your entire life

03:49.570 --> 03:53.330
without anyone saying "I hate you" to your face?

03:54.040 --> 03:55.220
Yeah.

03:55.660 --> 03:58.700
I'd say it now, but look at those cheekbones.

04:05.460 --> 04:07.750
I miss Stuart's place.

04:07.750 --> 04:11.560
All this loud music and exposed brick.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.430
What, is this a comic book store,

04:13.430 --> 04:17.010
or a rave at the third little pig's house?

04:18.600 --> 04:20.340
Yup, I wish Stuart would reopen.

04:20.340 --> 04:22.310
I hate this place, too.

04:22.310 --> 04:24.010
Okay, him I believe

04:24.010 --> 04:27.500
because he's an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-old's T-shirt.

04:28.360 --> 04:29.540
But you're just upset about

04:29.540 --> 04:32.410
Stuart and your mom and all their HBOs.

04:32.410 --> 04:33.600
Yes, I am.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.770
You know, I can't even watch Game of Thrones now

04:35.770 --> 04:37.390
without thinking of mother saying,

04:37.390 --> 04:41.300
"Stuart, which one is Thrones?"

04:43.170 --> 04:44.300
You know, he might not reopen.

04:44.300 --> 04:46.410
He didn't get a lot of money from the insurance company.

04:46.410 --> 04:49.130
Oh, boy, if there is one thing that gets my goat,

04:49.130 --> 04:52.160
it's those dad-gum insurance companies.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.270
Why? Because they won't get off your lawn?

04:59.480 --> 05:02.900
Oh, is Stuart trying to get a loan, or-or find investors?

05:02.900 --> 05:04.060
All I know is, he's got my mother

05:04.060 --> 05:06.200
buying four-ply toilet paper.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.310
I mean, four-ply.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.120
If his butt is so delicate,

05:10.120 --> 05:12.770
why doesn't he just use an angora rabbit?

05:14.030 --> 05:17.240
For starters, they shed and bite.

05:19.490 --> 05:20.820
Hey, here's a thought.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.720
Why don't we put up the rest of the money that Stuart needs?

05:25.200 --> 05:29.070
So, we'd be, like, owners of a comic book store?

05:29.760 --> 05:31.520
It's kind of a dream come true.

05:31.520 --> 05:33.050
That does sound fun.

05:33.050 --> 05:34.140
Ooh, maybe we could come up

05:34.140 --> 05:36.890
with a business plan to compete with this place.

05:36.890 --> 05:38.930
I'll give you a plan right now.

05:38.930 --> 05:41.480
Step one: open comic book store.

05:41.480 --> 05:42.790
Step two: start rumor

05:42.790 --> 05:45.990
this comic book store gives you genital warts.

05:48.100 --> 05:52.540
Step three: buy a big bag to put the money in.

05:55.370 --> 05:56.840
It's not that bad.

06:03.650 --> 06:06.400
Thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch on you.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.460
I really appreciate it.

06:07.460 --> 06:09.350
- Sure. - Um, I brought coffee.

06:09.350 --> 06:10.790
I wasn't sure what you like, so I got

06:10.790 --> 06:13.410
a regular, a cappuccino and a Chai tea.

06:13.410 --> 06:15.920
Since you like Raj, I thought you might be into that.

06:17.550 --> 06:19.870
Thanks. If we could get started. I'm a little busy.

06:19.870 --> 06:22.390
Oh, yeah, sure. Let me just get out my materials.

06:22.390 --> 06:23.900
Leonard gave me this briefcase.

06:23.900 --> 06:25.680
He used to carry it around in high school.

06:25.680 --> 06:29.410
You can still see the dent where they whacked him with it.

06:31.180 --> 06:32.990
Okay, I would like to talk to you

06:32.990 --> 06:35.590
about our new birth control pill, Femevra.

06:35.590 --> 06:36.510
Great.

06:36.510 --> 06:38.960
So, Femevra's triphasic design

06:38.960 --> 06:41.450
provides balanced hormonal exposure.

06:41.830 --> 06:43.130
All right.

06:44.040 --> 06:45.440
It has also been shown to cause

06:45.440 --> 06:48.850
significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives.

06:48.850 --> 06:51.210
Although it can cause acne, which, if you ask me, kind of

06:51.210 --> 06:54.490
increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive.

06:58.730 --> 06:59.980
Funny.

07:01.270 --> 07:04.070
Okay, I'm sorry. Did we get off on the wrong foot?

07:04.070 --> 07:05.660
Because since the other night, I kind of feel like

07:05.660 --> 07:07.610
you might have a problem with me.

07:07.610 --> 07:09.210
No, it's fine.

07:09.210 --> 07:11.720
Are you sure, because it doesn't seem fine?

07:12.580 --> 07:13.470
Okay.

07:13.470 --> 07:15.450
If you really want to talk about this,

07:15.450 --> 07:16.690
I do have a problem.

07:16.690 --> 07:18.780
Oh, my God. Tell me-- what did I do?

07:18.780 --> 07:20.820
Look, it's nothing. It's just...

07:20.820 --> 07:23.670
Raj told me that a while ago, you two hooked up.

07:23.670 --> 07:26.830
What?! Oh, why would he say that?

07:27.840 --> 07:28.900
Did it not happen?

07:28.900 --> 07:31.700
Well, I wouldn't exactly call it a hook-up.

07:31.700 --> 07:33.060
Did you kiss?

07:33.060 --> 07:34.230
Yeah.

07:34.770 --> 07:36.340
Were you naked?

07:36.340 --> 07:37.770
Yeah.

07:38.730 --> 07:39.800
So, it was a hook-up.

07:39.800 --> 07:40.630
No.

07:41.860 --> 07:43.280
Yeah.

07:46.990 --> 07:49.890
So, what are some ways we could set our comic book store

07:49.890 --> 07:51.520
apart from the competition?

07:51.520 --> 07:53.550
Oh, kids buy comic books. It would be great

07:53.550 --> 07:55.420
to figure out a way to get more kids in the store.

07:55.430 --> 07:57.100
You know, when I was a kid, I loved going there,

07:57.100 --> 07:58.970
but I could never get a ride.

07:58.970 --> 08:00.560
Ooh, what if we got a van

08:00.560 --> 08:03.200
and drove around and picked kids up?

08:07.910 --> 08:09.810
Nice.

08:10.920 --> 08:14.400
You mean, like at parks and schools?

08:14.750 --> 08:17.080
Toy stores, puppet shows.

08:18.360 --> 08:22.000
Hold on. So, your idea is to get a van

08:22.000 --> 08:25.760
and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up?

08:26.460 --> 08:28.000
Yes.

08:30.220 --> 08:34.000
And are you gonna use candy to lure them in?

08:35.840 --> 08:37.570
We are now!

08:39.580 --> 08:41.740
You told Emily we hooked up?!

08:41.740 --> 08:44.940
Um, well, in my defense, I tell everybody.

08:44.940 --> 08:46.410
Why would you say that?!

08:46.410 --> 08:48.640
We were having a conversation about past lovers.

08:48.650 --> 08:49.850
We weren't lovers! Come on.

08:49.850 --> 08:51.110
Everyone knows we didn't sleep together.

08:51.120 --> 08:52.410
We got drunk and fooled around.

08:52.420 --> 08:54.120
Why couldn't you just leave me out of it?

08:54.120 --> 08:55.280
Well, we were being honest.

08:55.290 --> 08:57.090
You would leave me out of the conversation

08:57.090 --> 08:58.920
with the next guy if you dump Leonard?

08:58.920 --> 09:01.130
- Why say it? - Yes!

09:02.130 --> 09:04.900
Well, I would never leave you off my list,

09:05.340 --> 09:06.630
and not just because, without you,

09:06.630 --> 09:09.630
we're playing fast and loose with the word "list."

09:10.020 --> 09:12.210
Well, good job. Now she hates me.

09:14.440 --> 09:15.990
Great.

09:15.990 --> 09:18.700
On the bright side, that Oxford study was right.

09:18.700 --> 09:20.780
One friend down.

09:22.670 --> 09:25.950
I wonder who you're going to lose next.

09:26.050 --> 09:28.930
You, okay? It's you. You're-you're next!

09:30.720 --> 09:33.210
No. You're crazy about me.

09:38.290 --> 09:40.030
I don't know what Emily's so upset about anyway.

09:40.030 --> 09:41.590
Even if I had slept with him, so what?

09:41.590 --> 09:43.230
Everyone has a past.

09:43.230 --> 09:46.630
Almost everyone has a past.

09:46.650 --> 09:47.910
Come on, look how pretty you are.

09:47.910 --> 09:50.460
I'm sure this isn't the first girl to hate you.

09:50.460 --> 09:52.250
It's not.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.330
And I'm sure you can turn it around.

09:55.330 --> 09:57.980
How? You can't force someone to like you.

09:57.980 --> 10:00.290
What if you just hang around and act like her friend

10:00.290 --> 10:01.690
until you wear her down?

10:01.690 --> 10:03.600
I mean, next thing you know, you're in her home,

10:03.600 --> 10:06.980
you're eating her food, drinking her wine.

10:08.660 --> 10:09.920
No, that won't work.

10:09.920 --> 10:11.850
You're right. Cheers.

10:12.710 --> 10:13.870
Oh, I know.

10:13.870 --> 10:15.730
Why don't you use your sales training

10:15.730 --> 10:17.930
to go back down there and sell yourself?

10:17.930 --> 10:19.260
- What? - Yeah.

10:19.260 --> 10:20.430
But instead of selling a drug,

10:20.430 --> 10:22.550
you'd be selling Penny-- it's cute.

10:22.550 --> 10:24.180
It's stupid.

10:24.180 --> 10:25.570
Well, maybe people would like you more

10:25.570 --> 10:28.180
if you didn't crap all over their ideas.

10:29.310 --> 10:31.060
I'm gonna go with Penny on this one.

10:31.060 --> 10:34.430
Then again, why wouldn't I? I mean, we go way back.

10:35.340 --> 10:37.630
Oh, my God. I didn't used to like you.

10:37.630 --> 10:39.980
Shh. Amy's here now.

10:44.720 --> 10:46.390
You know, the more I think about it,

10:46.390 --> 10:50.170
the more intrigued I am about having our own store.

10:50.170 --> 10:51.980
We'll get to see all the new stuff

10:51.980 --> 10:53.660
before it hits the shelves.

10:53.660 --> 10:56.560
And we'll get to have fun interactions with our customers.

10:56.560 --> 10:59.980
"This isn't a library... buy it or get out."

11:00.650 --> 11:03.140
You say things like that all the time.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.660
Yes, but as a store owner,

11:04.660 --> 11:06.330
I'll finally have a good comeback to,

11:06.330 --> 11:08.240
"You don't work here... shut up."

11:09.250 --> 11:11.420
Uh, do you know how Penny told Raj he should have

11:11.420 --> 11:13.770
- left her off his list? - Yeah.

11:13.770 --> 11:15.830
Well, do you think when she and I had that conversation,

11:15.830 --> 11:17.440
she left people off her list?

11:17.440 --> 11:19.020
I'm sure she did.

11:20.210 --> 11:21.410
Why?

11:21.800 --> 11:22.940
Because if she hadn't,

11:22.940 --> 11:25.620
she'd still be wading through the list.

11:26.870 --> 11:28.230
Will you stay out of this?

11:28.380 --> 11:30.970
If only Penny had said that once in a while.

11:33.340 --> 11:34.480
Hey, what difference does it make?

11:34.480 --> 11:36.430
You're the one she wants to marry.

11:36.430 --> 11:37.320
That's true.

11:37.320 --> 11:39.670
Yeah, and I'm not sure that complete honesty

11:39.670 --> 11:42.510
is always the best thing for a relationship.

11:42.510 --> 11:43.760
Yeah, he's right.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.780
Once, in a moment of candor,

11:45.780 --> 11:48.570
I told Amy that her hair reminded me

11:48.570 --> 11:51.710
of a duck caught in an oil spill. Well...

11:52.190 --> 11:53.680
she stormed out.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.410
Which was sad, because we were playing Scrabble,

11:56.410 --> 12:00.480
and I had all the letters to spell "persimmon."

12:03.890 --> 12:06.260
Why are you even part of this conversation?

12:06.260 --> 12:08.120
You don't know anything about women.

12:08.130 --> 12:10.790
I know that if I had a wife or a fiance,

12:10.800 --> 12:12.830
I'd ask her first before I invested money

12:12.830 --> 12:14.920
in a comic book store.

12:16.070 --> 12:17.080
He's right.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.680
Yeah, well, of course I am.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.230
I was also right about her hair.

12:20.230 --> 12:22.340
It did everything but quack.

12:25.410 --> 12:27.680
There's something I wanted to run past you.

12:27.680 --> 12:28.770
What's up?

12:28.770 --> 12:30.660
Mm, the guys and I were thinking about

12:30.660 --> 12:32.650
investing in Stuart's comic book store.

12:32.650 --> 12:35.120
- Is that okay? - Why are you asking me?

12:35.120 --> 12:36.950
Well, you know, we're engaged,

12:36.960 --> 12:39.460
and it's kind of a big deal financially.

12:39.460 --> 12:41.760
It seems like something we should talk about.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.430
Well, would you consider mounds of credit card debt

12:45.430 --> 12:48.030
kind of a big deal financially?

12:49.970 --> 12:51.230
Yeah.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.590
So, me and the guys were talking about

12:58.590 --> 13:00.840
this great investment opportunity...

13:00.850 --> 13:01.680
Nope.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.610
But you didn't hear what it was.

13:05.610 --> 13:06.870
I know.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.280
Oh, come on.

13:11.280 --> 13:12.480
Fine. What is it?

13:12.480 --> 13:14.790
It's to help reopen the comic book store.

13:14.790 --> 13:16.410
Nope.

13:16.410 --> 13:18.590
Well, hear me out.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.760
Howard, you know we're saving up for a house.

13:20.770 --> 13:22.720
I know, but all the guys are doing it.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.090
We're splitting it four ways,

13:24.090 --> 13:26.360
so it's really not that much money.

13:26.800 --> 13:29.030
It just seems like a risky investment.

13:29.030 --> 13:31.450
I get that. I...

13:32.850 --> 13:35.340
Okay, look...

13:36.800 --> 13:41.350
The reason this is important is...

13:42.490 --> 13:46.120
...before my dad left me and my mom...

13:46.120 --> 13:50.730
he used to... take me to the comic book store.

13:50.940 --> 13:54.560
It was one of the few things we did together.

13:54.890 --> 13:56.890
Oh. Howie, I had no idea.

13:56.890 --> 14:00.060
Well, I don't... like to talk about it.

14:00.070 --> 14:02.830
Oh, baby.

14:02.830 --> 14:05.930
That story's made up, isn't it?

14:08.050 --> 14:11.630
That's how much buying a comic book store means to me.

14:14.070 --> 14:16.590
I'd like your honest opinion on something.

14:17.140 --> 14:18.510
Of course.

14:18.510 --> 14:20.220
Now, before I start,

14:20.220 --> 14:23.630
I need you to know that I'm very excited about this,

14:23.630 --> 14:25.860
and anything you say

14:25.860 --> 14:27.920
that isn't enthusiastically supportive

14:27.930 --> 14:32.500
will throw our entire relationship into question.

14:34.160 --> 14:35.530
So...

14:35.530 --> 14:38.170
keep an open mind.

14:38.830 --> 14:41.520
I'm feeling a little backed into a corner, Sheldon.

14:41.520 --> 14:43.830
Perfect. Now...

14:44.470 --> 14:47.040
...I'm considering investing

14:47.050 --> 14:49.880
in Stuart's comic book store.

14:50.670 --> 14:52.500
Interesting.

14:54.380 --> 14:56.880
Can you see how a grown man,

14:56.880 --> 14:58.990
an accomplished scientist,

14:58.990 --> 15:00.910
who invests in a store

15:00.910 --> 15:03.050
that sells picture books

15:03.050 --> 15:06.540
about flying men in colorful underwear...

15:07.440 --> 15:09.870
...might be wasting both his financial

15:09.870 --> 15:12.590
and intellectual resources?

15:18.640 --> 15:20.010
No.

15:22.450 --> 15:24.880
Then I think it's a terrific idea.

15:25.660 --> 15:26.770
Great.

15:26.770 --> 15:30.250
Wait till you hear about our van.

15:35.920 --> 15:37.110
Thanks for inviting us over.

15:37.110 --> 15:38.480
Oh, thank you for coming.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.890
Uh, listen, Penny, before you start,

15:40.890 --> 15:42.950
I just want to apologize for being so rude

15:42.950 --> 15:44.110
the other day in my office.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.620
No, no. No need to apologize.

15:45.620 --> 15:47.410
Excuse me, can I say something?

15:47.410 --> 15:49.030
I just love both you guys,

15:49.030 --> 15:51.790
and I want you to get along.

15:52.010 --> 15:54.220
And when I say "love," I meant as a friend.

15:55.650 --> 15:58.510
And, uh, way too soon, right?

15:59.360 --> 16:01.060
Okay, sit down. Listen, Emily,

16:01.060 --> 16:02.590
what happened between me and Raj

16:02.590 --> 16:04.220
- was a long time ago. - It was,

16:04.220 --> 16:06.730
and I may have made it seem like a bigger deal than I should have.

16:06.730 --> 16:08.310
Yeah, and Leonard and I are engaged now,

16:08.310 --> 16:11.190
and I'm just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us.

16:11.580 --> 16:13.020
I'd like that, too.

16:13.020 --> 16:14.880
Yeah, I thought I'd be okay with it,

16:14.880 --> 16:16.890
but then I saw how pretty you are.

16:16.890 --> 16:18.730
Oh, that's so sweet.

16:18.730 --> 16:20.790
I mean, look at you-- you are gorgeous.

16:20.790 --> 16:23.570
It's true-- you're both gorgeous.

16:24.580 --> 16:28.060
Kind of says something about the man who could bed you both.

16:34.780 --> 16:38.020
You get why I've been alone most of my adult life.

16:40.510 --> 16:42.510
So, what brings you by?

16:42.510 --> 16:45.720
Well, I don't need a reason-- it's my house.

16:46.210 --> 16:48.110
Technically, it's your mom's house, but...

16:48.110 --> 16:51.310
we certainly want you to feel welcome.

16:51.850 --> 16:53.900
I'm always welcome.

16:53.900 --> 16:57.320
Mm, just... try and call first.

16:57.690 --> 16:59.710
Okay, let's get down to business.

17:00.890 --> 17:02.640
Howie was thinking about putting up some money

17:02.640 --> 17:04.090
to help you reopen the store,

17:04.090 --> 17:07.020
but before that happens, I have a few questions.

17:07.580 --> 17:08.720
I appreciate the offer,

17:08.720 --> 17:12.050
but actually your mother already gave me the money.

17:13.990 --> 17:15.080
What?

17:16.560 --> 17:18.270
Yeah. I told her it was too much,

17:18.270 --> 17:21.600
but she said she was happy to help out her bubala.

17:23.350 --> 17:25.010
Excuse me.

17:25.760 --> 17:28.240
Ma, you are canceling that check,

17:28.240 --> 17:30.930
and Stuart is not your bubala; I'm your bubala.

17:30.930 --> 17:33.500
You can't have more than one bubala!

17:34.630 --> 17:35.660
I don't know who he's talking to.

17:35.660 --> 17:38.470
She's at Target, buying me shirts.

17:41.500 --> 17:44.010
I'm so glad we could work this all out.

17:44.010 --> 17:45.810
Yeah, me, too.

17:45.810 --> 17:47.740
You know, we should have dinner one night with you and Leonard.

17:47.740 --> 17:49.020
Oh, we would love that.

17:49.020 --> 17:49.810
Great!

17:51.050 --> 17:53.070
- Okay, good night, guys. - All right, night.

17:53.070 --> 17:54.570
Bye.

17:55.220 --> 17:57.350
- I hate her. - I hate her.

18:03.140 --> 18:04.380
I'm really disappointed we're not gonna have

18:04.380 --> 18:06.330
- our own comic book store. - I know.

18:06.330 --> 18:07.530
I was looking forward to it.

18:07.530 --> 18:10.530
It would've been so nice to have a place that was ours,

18:10.530 --> 18:13.450
where we could just sit and read comics in peace.

18:13.450 --> 18:14.770
With comfy seats.

18:14.770 --> 18:16.150
And snacks.

18:16.150 --> 18:18.390
Well, I guess it was too good to be true.

18:18.390 --> 18:19.880
Yeah.
