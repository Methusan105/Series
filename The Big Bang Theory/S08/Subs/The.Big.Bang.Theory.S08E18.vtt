00:03.200 --> 00:05.260
Two one six four two zero

00:05.260 --> 00:07.320
one nine eight nine.

00:07.320 --> 00:11.130
And that, little lady, is pi to a thousand places.

00:11.680 --> 00:13.300
I'd say I'm sorry I asked,

00:13.300 --> 00:15.090
except I didn't.

00:15.720 --> 00:18.500
Oh, look, it's the Scientific American

00:18.500 --> 00:20.460
that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote.

00:20.460 --> 00:22.010
Oh, let me see.

00:22.580 --> 00:25.260
I have mixed feelings about doing interviews.

00:25.260 --> 00:27.200
I like the part where I talk.

00:27.200 --> 00:30.300
I do not like the part where the other man talks.

00:32.240 --> 00:35.800
Sheldon, this article doesn't mention Leonard at all.

00:35.800 --> 00:37.340
Well, that can't be right.

00:37.340 --> 00:40.270
It only refers to "Dr. Cooper and his team."

00:40.270 --> 00:41.860
Did you even talk about him?

00:41.860 --> 00:44.390
All I did was answer a few questions about the theory.

00:44.390 --> 00:46.830
And then expressed my gratitude that Scientific American

00:46.830 --> 00:50.090
doesn't include any of those smelly perfume cards.

00:50.990 --> 00:52.480
Poor Leonard.

00:52.490 --> 00:55.560
Why? The theory he came up with

00:55.560 --> 00:57.130
just got mentioned in Scientific American.

00:57.130 --> 00:58.210
He ought to be thrilled.

00:58.210 --> 00:59.920
He might not be.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.700
Oh, maybe you're right.

01:01.700 --> 01:03.940
He is kind of a lump.

01:04.520 --> 01:05.440
Think about it.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.980
How would you feel if you were referred to

01:06.980 --> 01:08.870
as part of Leonard's team?

01:08.870 --> 01:10.970
Oh, I'd be incensed.

01:10.970 --> 01:13.150
So you see what I'm getting at?

01:13.870 --> 01:16.290
Squeaky wheel gets the grease?

01:16.290 --> 01:17.320
No.

01:17.900 --> 01:20.150
Grass is always greener?

01:20.150 --> 01:21.010
Try again.

01:21.010 --> 01:22.860
Well, I don't know-- we're all Groot?

01:22.860 --> 01:24.790
Just tell me.

01:25.240 --> 01:27.920
Leonard is as much a part of this paper as you are,

01:27.920 --> 01:29.510
and he was overlooked.

01:29.510 --> 01:31.430
He's going to feel bad.

01:31.430 --> 01:33.200
But it wasn't my fault.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.740
I didn't exclude him.

01:34.740 --> 01:36.820
And I didn't write the article.

01:37.160 --> 01:39.200
Remember that time you didn't get picked to

01:39.200 --> 01:41.180
pull the sword out of the stone at Disneyland

01:41.180 --> 01:42.660
and they let that other kid do it?

01:42.660 --> 01:45.010
Oh, that kid!

01:48.400 --> 01:50.870
Poor Leonard.

01:51.400 --> 01:52.890
Exactly.

01:52.890 --> 01:55.240
For the record, that kid was a terrible choice.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.320
If you cry when you drop your churro,

01:57.320 --> 02:00.050
you do not have what it takes to rule England.

02:28.220 --> 02:30.930
Thanks for helping us sort through all my mom's stuff.

02:30.930 --> 02:32.230
Of course.

02:32.230 --> 02:33.380
I know what it's like

02:33.380 --> 02:35.940
having to go through a loved one's possessions.

02:35.940 --> 02:38.760
My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna.

02:38.760 --> 02:41.210
But after he died, you know what we found?

02:41.210 --> 02:43.870
A statue of Shiva.

02:46.920 --> 02:48.570
It may not be Crips and Bloods, okay?

02:48.570 --> 02:50.990
But in India, it's a thing.

02:52.590 --> 02:54.050
Well, it'll be good that you're there.

02:54.050 --> 02:55.320
Howard's been having trouble deciding

02:55.320 --> 02:57.440
what to keep and what to let go.

02:57.440 --> 02:58.720
Well, it's hard.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.130
A lot of Ma's stuff brings back fond memories.

03:02.130 --> 03:03.140
Is that why you couldn't get rid of

03:03.140 --> 03:06.030
her drawer full of ketchup packets?

03:06.660 --> 03:07.340
Yes.

03:07.340 --> 03:09.840
It reminds me of us eating out and her saying,

03:09.840 --> 03:13.160
"Quick, nobody's looking, fill your pockets with ketchup."

03:20.160 --> 03:21.580
Leonard?

03:21.970 --> 03:23.890
Have you ever noticed

03:23.890 --> 03:28.640
that only my name is on the cable bill?

03:30.600 --> 03:31.350
Yeah.

03:31.350 --> 03:33.860
Good, good.

03:34.290 --> 03:36.570
And your name is on the electric bill

03:36.570 --> 03:37.530
and mine isn't.

03:37.530 --> 03:39.240
And I'm okay with that.

03:39.240 --> 03:41.640
Actually, your name is on the electric bill.

03:41.640 --> 03:43.420
Oh, right.

03:45.260 --> 03:47.550
This is a disaster.

03:48.740 --> 03:51.440
I don't even know what you're talking about and I agree.

03:52.270 --> 03:55.780
Okay, I have to tell you something,

03:55.780 --> 03:57.620
but you're not going to like it.

03:57.620 --> 03:59.070
What's going on?

03:59.810 --> 04:01.660
An article was just published

04:01.660 --> 04:04.820
in Scientific American about our theory.

04:04.820 --> 04:06.230
Did they hate it?

04:06.230 --> 04:08.170
No. No, they loved it.

04:08.170 --> 04:11.120
They, uh, couldn't say enough nice things about it.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.490
So what's the problem?

04:15.040 --> 04:17.180
You know how the PennySaver only has my name...

04:17.180 --> 04:18.410
Sheldon!

04:19.870 --> 04:21.920
They didn't mention you in the article.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.430
Only me.

04:24.280 --> 04:25.160
Really?

04:25.160 --> 04:26.140
I know.

04:26.140 --> 04:28.100
It's not fair.

04:30.950 --> 04:33.490
Let the anger go, buddy.

04:33.720 --> 04:34.570
You just...

04:34.570 --> 04:37.160
you relax all your muscles.

04:37.160 --> 04:39.850
Except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter.

04:39.850 --> 04:42.050
Let's keep those tight.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.670
Uh, that-that's not necessary.

04:45.670 --> 04:49.140
It is-- they're what hold back the urine and the feces.

04:50.050 --> 04:51.580
Look, maybe-maybe you shouldn't read it.

04:51.580 --> 04:53.740
It'll only make you feel worse.

04:53.740 --> 04:55.590
"Cooper and his team"?

04:55.590 --> 04:58.760
You should know I had nothing to do with that.

05:00.590 --> 05:02.930
At least they're talking about the theory.

05:02.930 --> 05:06.000
I mean, that's what's important.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.820
You know, you're right.

05:07.820 --> 05:11.090
Yeah. You know, it's like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko

05:11.090 --> 05:12.590
created Spider-Man.

05:12.720 --> 05:14.450
Stan Lee may get all the credit,

05:14.450 --> 05:17.410
but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important.

05:17.410 --> 05:20.500
Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.580
And-and he's far richer.

05:22.580 --> 05:24.240
And he's a household name, you know?

05:24.240 --> 05:26.350
Whereas, you know, you say Ditko,

05:26.350 --> 05:30.040
and that sounds like a company that makes Dits.

05:31.700 --> 05:33.530
That's not helping.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.660
Well, I'd give more examples,

05:36.660 --> 05:40.000
but, well, everyone in your position's so forgettable.

05:42.990 --> 05:44.950
Stuart, we're here.

05:44.950 --> 05:47.700
It's nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom's house.

05:47.700 --> 05:50.270
Yeah, well, I tried putting him out on the curb,

05:50.270 --> 05:52.720
but nobody took him.

05:55.120 --> 05:56.850
Just so you know, the power's out.

05:56.850 --> 05:57.760
What happened?

05:57.800 --> 06:00.300
I called, they said a transformer blew.

06:00.300 --> 06:01.280
It's the whole block.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.000
Should be fixed by tomorrow.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.760
Wait, when did it go out?

06:04.760 --> 06:06.420
In the middle of the night.

06:06.420 --> 06:08.220
Oh, my God.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.640
Howie, what's wrong?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.650
It's all defrosting.

06:15.650 --> 06:17.150
It's okay. It's just food.

06:17.150 --> 06:20.350
It's not just food.

06:20.350 --> 06:23.410
This is the last food my mother ever made.

06:23.410 --> 06:25.490
This is her last brisket.

06:25.490 --> 06:27.790
This is her last meatloaf.

06:27.790 --> 06:29.070
This is her last...

06:30.200 --> 06:33.360
I have no idea what this is, but...

06:34.140 --> 06:36.250
it's the last one.

06:36.670 --> 06:37.540
Everything okay?

06:37.540 --> 06:38.930
No.

06:38.930 --> 06:41.750
All Ma's food is gonna be ruined.

06:41.750 --> 06:44.010
Well, why don't we take it home and put it in our freezer?

06:44.010 --> 06:45.720
You don't want to do that.

06:45.720 --> 06:47.850
Refreezing not only removes moisture,

06:47.850 --> 06:49.960
but it creates ice crystals in the fibers of the meat

06:49.960 --> 06:52.920
that can compromise its taste and texture.

06:54.300 --> 06:55.630
What? I saw a teachable moment.

06:55.630 --> 06:58.480
I dropped some culinary science.

07:00.180 --> 07:02.000
What should we do?

07:02.300 --> 07:04.380
I'll tell you exactly what we're gonna do.

07:05.160 --> 07:06.370
We're gonna eat it.

07:06.370 --> 07:08.120
There's, like, 20 pounds of food in there.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.690
All you said was I had to get rid of things.

07:10.690 --> 07:14.090
You didn't say they couldn't pass through my colon first.

07:15.110 --> 07:16.210
Howie...

07:17.450 --> 07:18.550
Okay.

07:19.080 --> 07:21.420
Then how about this?

07:21.420 --> 07:23.730
Let's invite everyone over to dinner.

07:23.760 --> 07:27.790
It'll be like Ma's feeding us one last time.

07:29.020 --> 07:30.820
I love that.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.750
Me, too.

07:33.990 --> 07:36.020
Oh, look, we've got enough ketchup

07:36.020 --> 07:38.420
to cover every ounce of it.

07:41.110 --> 07:44.090
I mean, who even reads Scientific American?

07:47.690 --> 07:49.460
It's kind of a big deal.

07:49.460 --> 07:51.440
If it's such a big deal, how come the biggest celebrity

07:51.440 --> 07:54.260
they could get for the cover is a molecule?

07:56.400 --> 07:58.430
Can we please just stop talking about it?

07:58.430 --> 08:00.050
I'm sorry. What can I do?

08:00.050 --> 08:02.020
Nothing, I'm fine.

08:02.670 --> 08:04.450
No, no. I'm gonna cheer you up.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.600
Here we go.

08:08.600 --> 08:09.590
What are we doing?

08:09.590 --> 08:11.290
I am taking you shopping.

08:11.290 --> 08:14.930
My baby is sad, and I'm gonna make him happy again.

08:14.930 --> 08:16.650
Look, I know shopping cheers you up,

08:16.650 --> 08:18.740
but it's just not really my thing.

08:18.740 --> 08:20.390
Well, what about this helicopter

08:20.390 --> 08:22.570
you control with an iPad?

08:22.570 --> 08:24.300
Does it have a camera in it?

08:25.240 --> 08:28.480
It does have a camera in it.

08:28.480 --> 08:30.750
Baby's listening.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.200
Leonard?

08:33.200 --> 08:35.240
Leonard? Leonard?

08:35.240 --> 08:35.990
What?

08:35.990 --> 08:38.700
I spoke to the reporter at the magazine.

08:40.410 --> 08:42.430
What happened? Did you tell him it was my idea?

08:42.430 --> 08:43.630
I did.

08:43.630 --> 08:45.610
Thank you. What did he say?

08:45.610 --> 08:48.340
He said they made the editorial decision

08:48.340 --> 08:50.600
to only cite the lead scientist.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.840
Why did he think you're the lead scientist?

08:52.840 --> 08:54.290
It was my idea!

08:54.290 --> 08:55.580
You know, for an extra four bucks,

08:55.580 --> 08:57.880
I can have this thing here tomorrow.

08:58.680 --> 09:00.600
Well, I know it was your idea,

09:00.600 --> 09:03.180
but the reporter said he's been following my work for a while,

09:03.180 --> 09:05.020
and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine

09:05.020 --> 09:06.260
is 'cause my name is on it.

09:06.260 --> 09:08.510
You know what? I did it. What's four bucks?

09:09.330 --> 09:11.330
If you're trying to make me feel better,

09:11.330 --> 09:12.750
it's not working.

09:12.750 --> 09:15.410
Well... then what if I told you

09:15.410 --> 09:18.400
that I added your name to the cable bill?

09:21.190 --> 09:22.830
No.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.710
That's just as well. They had me on hold for 20 minutes

09:24.710 --> 09:26.130
and I hung up. I...

09:28.280 --> 09:30.310
Leonard? Leonard?

09:30.690 --> 09:32.130
Leonard?

09:34.330 --> 09:38.200
Also, Wolowitz invited us all to dinner, so...

09:39.160 --> 09:41.030
I'm ready whenever you are.

09:47.710 --> 09:49.940
All he had was an idea.

09:49.940 --> 09:51.660
Well, that is an important part.

09:51.660 --> 09:53.060
Oh, please!

09:53.060 --> 09:55.120
I have ideas all day long.

09:55.120 --> 09:59.460
Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people.

09:59.920 --> 10:05.190
A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge.

10:05.590 --> 10:08.290
Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy.

10:08.290 --> 10:10.190
Why won't Doc prescribe him something?

10:10.190 --> 10:12.070
We finally find out.

10:12.970 --> 10:15.220
But Leonard's idea was good.

10:16.460 --> 10:20.030
Fine. Then Grumpy-- what's he so grumpy about?

10:20.030 --> 10:22.960
Maybe his girlfriend won't take his side.

10:24.490 --> 10:26.690
I'm the one who thought of it!

10:26.690 --> 10:28.740
Well, didn't he do a lot of the work?

10:28.740 --> 10:30.870
But now he's happy to let people think

10:30.870 --> 10:33.240
he's responsible for everything.

10:33.240 --> 10:37.250
And that's why you get an iPad helicopter!

10:38.390 --> 10:41.950
Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does?

10:41.950 --> 10:43.220
It's not your fault.

10:43.220 --> 10:45.230
Is it my fault that my name came first

10:45.230 --> 10:46.690
on the paper alphabetically?

10:46.690 --> 10:47.660
Not your fault.

10:47.660 --> 10:49.510
Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me

10:49.510 --> 10:52.350
as the lead scientist I didn't correct him?

10:53.050 --> 10:55.310
Hey, look at that pretty bird.

10:56.300 --> 10:58.060
He always needs all the attention.

10:58.060 --> 10:59.150
He's such a baby.

10:59.150 --> 11:00.650
I know, I know.

11:00.650 --> 11:04.090
I swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter.

11:06.760 --> 11:10.250
Okay, I'll start heating some of this stuff up.

11:10.250 --> 11:11.210
Thanks.

11:11.210 --> 11:12.700
Oh, man.

11:12.700 --> 11:16.820
This is the boutonniere from my high school prom...

11:17.610 --> 11:21.120
...A piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah.

11:21.860 --> 11:23.350
Did she throw anything away?

11:23.350 --> 11:24.270
No.

11:24.270 --> 11:27.360
If I find my foreskin, I'm gonna kill myself.

11:29.490 --> 11:32.810
Okay, so we've got, um,

11:32.810 --> 11:35.850
three briskets, four meatloafs, one lasagna...

11:35.850 --> 11:37.600
No, that's noodle kugel.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.890
One Jewish lasagna...

11:40.580 --> 11:43.840
...two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each,

11:43.840 --> 11:47.660
and one giant container of matzah ball soup.

11:47.660 --> 11:51.080
Ma always kept it on hand,

11:51.080 --> 11:53.090
in case I got sick.

11:53.830 --> 11:58.950
She thought she could cure anything with her cooking.

11:58.950 --> 12:02.720
Even the time I got food poisoning.

12:03.720 --> 12:05.570
From her cooking.

12:08.530 --> 12:09.950
You okay?

12:10.870 --> 12:12.900
Yeah, I'm okay.

12:12.900 --> 12:13.920
Let's get started.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.330
You got it.

12:20.720 --> 12:24.210
I'm never gonna talk to her again.

12:31.660 --> 12:33.470
Should we tell everyone not to come?

12:33.470 --> 12:37.000
No. I want to do this.

12:37.980 --> 12:40.430
Okay. Well, I'll keep it together if you can.

12:40.840 --> 12:41.910
Okay.

12:42.670 --> 12:45.410
I'm not making any promises!

12:48.910 --> 12:50.280
Glad you guys could make it.

12:50.280 --> 12:51.100
Of course.

12:51.100 --> 12:52.510
Wow, it looks really pretty in here.

12:52.510 --> 12:57.270
Yeah, turns out half a dozen menorahs really sets a mood.

12:58.250 --> 12:59.930
So, Stuart, have you thought about what you'd do

12:59.930 --> 13:01.210
if Howard sells the house?

13:01.210 --> 13:03.640
And there goes the mood.

13:04.190 --> 13:05.850
Hi. Hello.

13:05.850 --> 13:07.770
Oh, and a special hello to Leonard,

13:07.770 --> 13:10.070
who needs to be mentioned by name.

13:11.850 --> 13:12.940
Subtle.

13:12.940 --> 13:14.740
But you got it, right?

13:16.340 --> 13:17.460
Hey, guys.

13:18.350 --> 13:19.730
I just want everyone to know,

13:19.730 --> 13:22.880
uh, tonight's not a sad occasion.

13:22.880 --> 13:24.340
Yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner

13:24.340 --> 13:26.490
that we've all had here so many times before.

13:26.490 --> 13:29.360
Good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight,

13:29.360 --> 13:32.070
heartburn that makes you pray for death.

13:33.630 --> 13:34.900
Do you need any help in the kitchen?

13:34.900 --> 13:37.740
No, we got it. You guys make yourselves comfortable.

13:39.010 --> 13:42.250
All right, hey, you two, we're here for Howard right now, okay?

13:42.250 --> 13:44.190
Yes, so please behave yourselves.

13:44.190 --> 13:46.080
- Fine. - Of course.

13:49.860 --> 13:51.900
So I heard you two, uh, wrote a paper together.

13:51.900 --> 13:53.510
How's that going?

13:57.260 --> 13:58.800
This food is amazing.

13:58.800 --> 14:01.200
Mm, and not a vegetable in sight.

14:01.810 --> 14:02.780
That's not true.

14:02.780 --> 14:04.850
We've got tomatoes right here.

14:07.020 --> 14:10.390
All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight.

14:10.390 --> 14:13.520
Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.270
Indeed.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.030
Penny, a salon is a gathering

14:18.030 --> 14:20.200
where intellectuals entertained each other

14:20.200 --> 14:23.200
with sparkling conversations about issues of the day.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.120
Oh, so it's like The View.

14:27.280 --> 14:31.340
Sheldon, The View is a daytime talk show hosted by women.

14:32.440 --> 14:33.640
Oh, I'm aware.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.380
It features Whoopi Goldberg.

14:35.380 --> 14:38.180
She played Guinan on Star Trek: Next Gen.

14:38.770 --> 14:40.840
Penny, Next Gen refers to

14:40.840 --> 14:42.290
- Star Trek... - Shut up.

14:44.010 --> 14:46.810
I would like to propose a salon topic.

14:46.810 --> 14:48.550
Ooh, please do, Rajesh.

14:48.550 --> 14:50.510
The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman.

14:50.860 --> 14:53.100
Marvel has made "Tor" a female.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.240
Wait, who's Tor?

14:55.240 --> 14:59.010
You know, Tor, the God of "Tunder."

15:00.400 --> 15:02.480
As I was saying, is this a sign

15:02.480 --> 15:06.760
that our society is approaching gender equality?

15:06.760 --> 15:09.330
Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now.

15:09.330 --> 15:10.310
It's true.

15:10.310 --> 15:13.110
At the store, I had to put a seat on the toilet.

15:14.690 --> 15:16.200
We won't know if there's equality

15:16.200 --> 15:17.830
until female Thor has a baby

15:17.830 --> 15:21.050
and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work.

15:22.050 --> 15:23.820
I wonder if only a baby who is worthy

15:23.820 --> 15:26.610
can suckle at the bosom of Thor.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.640
Okay, new salon topic.

15:28.640 --> 15:31.060
Salons-- dumb thing from a long time ago

15:31.060 --> 15:34.350
or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes?

15:34.350 --> 15:35.930
Discuss.

15:37.160 --> 15:39.310
I don't believe it matters what the topic is.

15:39.310 --> 15:41.250
What's crucial for a salon

15:41.250 --> 15:42.790
is that we conduct the discussion

15:42.790 --> 15:45.280
in an elevated and insightful way.

15:45.280 --> 15:47.400
It's all about the execution.

15:47.400 --> 15:50.960
Of course you'd focus on that rather than the inspiration.

15:50.960 --> 15:52.400
Uh, new salon topic.

15:52.400 --> 15:55.840
What's more important, an idea or its execution?

15:55.840 --> 15:56.900
Oh, that's fun.

15:56.900 --> 15:58.430
Yeah, good for you, Leonard.

15:58.430 --> 16:00.110
That's a lovely little notion.

16:00.110 --> 16:01.390
Kind of like,

16:01.390 --> 16:03.990
"I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago."

16:03.990 --> 16:07.140
Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone.

16:07.140 --> 16:08.970
"Hello? Oh, hold on."

16:08.970 --> 16:10.100
Leonard, it's your uncle.

16:10.100 --> 16:12.310
He says you just got burned.

16:13.710 --> 16:14.420
Sheldon.

16:14.420 --> 16:15.110
You guys.

16:15.110 --> 16:16.090
No, it's okay.

16:16.090 --> 16:18.940
We're all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion.

16:18.940 --> 16:19.740
At least I am.

16:19.740 --> 16:21.370
Howard, what do you think?

16:21.370 --> 16:24.130
Well, I guess, as an engineer,

16:24.130 --> 16:26.130
lean towards execution.

16:26.130 --> 16:28.110
I spend my days trying to take

16:28.110 --> 16:30.320
ideas and make them real.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.340
Well said, old chap.

16:32.340 --> 16:34.990
I thought eloquence had died; here it stands before us.

16:34.990 --> 16:36.800
Starting today, it'll go: Gettysburg Address,

16:36.800 --> 16:38.940
"I have a dream" and what you just said.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.160
Oh, now he's a genius?

16:41.160 --> 16:43.530
All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering.

16:43.530 --> 16:45.990
Leonard, please. His mother just died.

16:47.510 --> 16:48.480
You're being ridiculous.

16:48.480 --> 16:49.220
Yeah, so are you.

16:49.220 --> 16:50.850
Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy,

16:50.850 --> 16:52.910
I'd go to my real salon.

16:53.390 --> 16:55.250
Leonard, lots of people could've had that idea,

16:55.250 --> 16:57.990
but very few people could've worked out the math the way I did.

16:57.990 --> 17:00.790
Lots of people also didn't have that idea,

17:00.790 --> 17:03.360
like everyone in the entire world except for me.

17:03.360 --> 17:05.510
Oh, well, apparently Leonard thinks

17:05.510 --> 17:07.620
he's better than everyone in the whole world,

17:07.620 --> 17:09.880
including those fighting for our freedom.

17:09.880 --> 17:11.050
Yeah, well, I don't know about you,

17:11.050 --> 17:13.670
but I support our boys overseas.

17:15.350 --> 17:16.180
And girls.

17:16.180 --> 17:18.530
Hey, you already ruined Thor; give it a rest.

17:20.020 --> 17:21.520
So I'm just supposed to be okay

17:21.520 --> 17:23.550
with you hogging all the credit?!

17:23.550 --> 17:25.370
I didn't hog anything.

17:25.370 --> 17:29.090
Unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it.

17:29.090 --> 17:29.910
You want some of this?

17:29.910 --> 17:30.680
I'll give you some.

17:31.150 --> 17:33.920
Sheldon, Leonard, living room, right now!

17:39.550 --> 17:42.120
She said my name first; that must kill you.

17:43.950 --> 17:45.430
I don't know what you think you're doing,

17:45.430 --> 17:47.940
but this is a very difficult time for my husband!

17:47.940 --> 17:50.440
We're eating the last food his mother ever made,

17:50.440 --> 17:53.030
and you were gonna throw it at each other like children?!

17:53.030 --> 17:55.490
Whatever it is you're fighting about, put it aside,

17:55.490 --> 17:57.440
go back in there and be a good friend to Howard

17:57.440 --> 18:00.310
or there's no dessert for either of you!

18:04.030 --> 18:05.570
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

18:05.570 --> 18:06.180
And don't think...

18:06.180 --> 18:08.020
You guys ever notice sometimes

18:08.020 --> 18:10.540
Bernadette sounds like my mom?

18:11.400 --> 18:12.290
I don't hear it.

18:12.290 --> 18:13.640
No, not at all.

18:25.710 --> 18:29.170
I don't think I've eaten that much in my entire life.

18:29.170 --> 18:32.520
It's why my people wandered the desert for 40 years.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.680
Took that long to walk it off.

18:36.660 --> 18:38.740
You see, Penny, the Israelites were in the desert...

18:38.740 --> 18:40.380
Shut up!

18:41.920 --> 18:44.480
So glad you two are done fighting.

18:44.480 --> 18:48.360
Right now, I'm just trying to burp without throwing up.

18:49.620 --> 18:50.460
Hang on.

18:50.460 --> 18:52.890
Physics Today mentioned the paper.

18:52.890 --> 18:54.030
What'd they say?

18:54.030 --> 18:56.520
Who cares? Did they mention Leonard?

18:56.520 --> 18:57.850
They did.

18:57.850 --> 18:59.800
Yay.

19:00.830 --> 19:02.730
Good news, I found more Tums.

19:02.730 --> 19:04.950
Yay!
