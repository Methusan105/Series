00:03.830 --> 00:06.460
I recently read that during World War Two,

00:06.460 --> 00:08.780
Joseph Stalin had a research program

00:08.780 --> 00:10.490
to create supersoldiers

00:10.490 --> 00:13.870
by having women impregnated by gorillas.

00:15.130 --> 00:16.980
What a sick use of science.

00:16.980 --> 00:19.130
Hey, as long as the baby's healthy.

00:20.980 --> 00:23.390
I wonder if Stalin considered any other animals.

00:23.390 --> 00:25.410
Hippos are the deadliest creature.

00:25.410 --> 00:28.820
A half-human, half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass.

00:29.690 --> 00:31.680
Yes, but when they're hungry-hungry,

00:31.680 --> 00:34.310
you can stop them with marbles.

00:34.470 --> 00:35.850
Yeah, the correct animal

00:35.850 --> 00:38.790
for interspecies supersolider is koala.

00:38.790 --> 00:42.780
You would wind up with an army so cute it couldn't be attacked.

00:43.920 --> 00:46.480
But half-man, half-owl could fly...

00:46.480 --> 00:49.120
The answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses.

00:49.120 --> 00:50.370
Moving on.

00:51.730 --> 00:53.370
So, Penny, when's the new job start?

00:53.370 --> 00:54.550
Next Monday.

00:54.550 --> 00:56.840
Did you get a chance to look over the materials I gave you?

00:56.840 --> 00:58.140
Uh, not yet, but I will.

00:58.140 --> 01:00.210
Great. When?

01:00.910 --> 01:02.890
I said I'll get to it.

01:06.520 --> 01:09.280
I'm sensing awkwardness, am I right?

01:09.280 --> 01:10.250
Yes.

01:11.260 --> 01:12.430
Swish.

01:15.370 --> 01:16.370
I don't want to be pushy,

01:16.370 --> 01:19.180
but you've never done pharmaceutical sales before.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.680
It seems like you could use this time to get a head start.

01:21.680 --> 01:23.280
Well, the first few weeks will be all training.

01:23.280 --> 01:24.950
They'll tell me everything I need to know.

01:25.140 --> 01:27.100
But imagine how impressed they'd be if you showed up

01:27.100 --> 01:29.010
already familiar with the material.

01:29.090 --> 01:31.260
Okay, so what, you want me to be like a teacher's pet?

01:31.730 --> 01:33.070
Couldn't hurt.

01:33.070 --> 01:34.910
Mm, I don't know.

01:34.910 --> 01:35.970
Who here has ever been hurt

01:35.970 --> 01:37.940
because they were the teacher's pet?

01:41.780 --> 01:43.890
It was like the rest of the class wanted Ms. McDonald

01:43.890 --> 01:45.260
to forget the quiz.

02:12.700 --> 02:13.840
Mrs. Davis.

02:14.370 --> 02:15.320
Guess who?

02:15.440 --> 02:16.690
Dr. Cooper.

02:17.150 --> 02:18.780
That's right, good job.

02:20.290 --> 02:21.160
Hello.

02:21.300 --> 02:23.350
Uh, you wanted to see me?

02:23.350 --> 02:24.990
Yes. Uh, welcome back.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.020
Thank you.

02:26.200 --> 02:29.120
I assume you'd like to reopen our dialogue

02:29.120 --> 02:32.040
about the university forcing me to continue with string theory?

02:32.040 --> 02:33.640
You mean the dialogue that went,

02:33.640 --> 02:36.580
"Please?" "No." "Please?" "No." "Please?" "No."

02:38.260 --> 02:39.250
That's the one.

02:40.970 --> 02:44.220
I believe you went last, so, uh, please?

02:44.950 --> 02:48.600
Dr. Cooper, while you were away, we came up with a solution

02:48.600 --> 02:51.100
that would allow you to change your field of study.

02:52.510 --> 02:55.490
Pouting and running away actually worked.

02:56.280 --> 02:57.890
Yeah, I must say, that may not be a lesson

02:57.890 --> 02:59.640
you want to reinforce with me.

03:00.690 --> 03:03.440
So, um, what is the solution?

03:03.440 --> 03:05.530
Currently, you're being paid under a grant

03:05.530 --> 03:07.560
to specifically research string theory.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.870
If we promote you to junior professor,

03:09.870 --> 03:10.860
you'll be able to choose

03:10.860 --> 03:12.850
whatever field of research you'd like.

03:14.040 --> 03:18.180
But if I'm a professor, then I'll have to teach a class.

03:18.180 --> 03:19.500
That is correct.

03:20.830 --> 03:25.460
So your solution is to promote me and pay me more money

03:25.460 --> 03:27.400
so that I can impart my knowledge

03:27.400 --> 03:29.480
to the next generation of scientists?

03:29.490 --> 03:30.540
Yes.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.790
You people are sick.

03:38.950 --> 03:40.510
Hey. Ready to go to lunch?

03:40.750 --> 03:41.550
Just give me a minute.

03:41.550 --> 03:43.940
I'm stimulating the pleasure cells of this starfish.

03:43.940 --> 03:45.110
I just need to turn it off.

03:45.110 --> 03:46.310
What happens if you don't?

03:46.310 --> 03:47.480
Then I have to sit through lunch

03:47.480 --> 03:50.190
knowing this starfish is having a better day than I am.

03:52.350 --> 03:54.250
Is Bernadette meeting us at the restaurant?

03:54.250 --> 03:57.190
Uh, no. Actually, I didn't invite her.

03:57.230 --> 03:58.090
How come?

03:58.580 --> 04:00.130
Well, ever since she helped me get this job,

04:00.130 --> 04:01.830
she won't stop bugging me.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.120
Well, I think she just wants you to do well,

04:04.120 --> 04:05.590
and she's worried that you won't

04:05.590 --> 04:09.040
'cause you were just a stunningly poor waitress.

04:09.910 --> 04:11.250
That is not true.

04:11.250 --> 04:14.540
I'm still waiting on my mini corndogs from two years ago.

04:15.540 --> 04:18.280
I told you, they'll be right out.

04:19.710 --> 04:21.870
Okay, so no Bernadette.

04:21.880 --> 04:24.540
Well, you saw her the other night. Am I wrong?

04:24.740 --> 04:26.080
No, I just...

04:26.300 --> 04:29.100
I feel kind of uncomfortable talking about her like this.

04:29.100 --> 04:31.540
Usually when someone's being talked about behind their back,

04:31.540 --> 04:34.340
it's me and it's right in front of my face.

04:35.470 --> 04:37.850
I-I'm sorry. I just need a little break from her.

04:37.850 --> 04:39.170
I understand.

04:40.130 --> 04:43.830
You know, there is some research that indicates

04:43.830 --> 04:46.940
that sharing negative attitudes about a third party

04:46.940 --> 04:50.130
can be a powerful bonding force between two friends.

04:51.570 --> 04:52.730
So, what are you saying?

04:52.730 --> 04:55.530
I'm saying, in the spirit of science,

04:55.680 --> 04:58.310
what is that little skank's problem?

05:01.730 --> 05:03.700
So, I've been trying to come up

05:03.700 --> 05:06.200
with a cute couple's nickname for me and Emily.

05:06.220 --> 05:07.330
What do you like better...

05:07.670 --> 05:08.840
Emippali...

05:10.370 --> 05:12.170
or Koothrapemily?

05:14.110 --> 05:17.090
Why is it your last name and her first name?

05:17.150 --> 05:18.620
Oh, well, her last name is Sweeney,

05:18.620 --> 05:22.190
and something just didn't seem right about Koothrapeeney.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.160
Hey, how'd it go with human resources?

05:28.330 --> 05:29.370
Awful.

05:29.370 --> 05:31.760
Yeah, they're allowing me to move on from string theory,

05:31.760 --> 05:33.590
but they made me a junior professor

05:33.590 --> 05:35.820
and are requiring me to teach a class.

05:35.930 --> 05:38.690
I don't understand. Why is it bad that you have to teach?

05:38.700 --> 05:40.950
What a stupid question.

05:42.170 --> 05:44.200
The kids are gonna love him.

05:45.050 --> 05:47.330
I can't believe I have to waste my time

05:47.330 --> 05:49.420
babysitting a bunch of grad students

05:49.420 --> 05:52.300
who probably think dark matter is what's in their diapers.

05:53.740 --> 05:55.290
This might not be that bad.

05:55.290 --> 05:57.160
Uh, you like telling people they're wrong.

05:57.160 --> 05:58.240
Wrong!

05:59.890 --> 06:02.660
Just because I enjoyed that one doesn't mean I always do.

06:03.610 --> 06:05.590
You enjoy giving people grades.

06:05.590 --> 06:09.060
A valid point, but unoriginal... B-minus.

06:09.950 --> 06:11.850
And you love the sound of your own voice.

06:11.850 --> 06:13.510
Yeah, well, of course I do.

06:13.510 --> 06:14.520
Listen to it.

06:14.520 --> 06:17.350
It's like an earful of melted caramel.

06:18.820 --> 06:20.300
Look, most importantly,

06:20.300 --> 06:23.080
this will let you move on and study dark matter.

06:24.110 --> 06:27.130
It is true that many of my heroes have taken students

06:27.130 --> 06:28.310
under their wings:

06:28.320 --> 06:31.820
Feynman, Einstein, Professor X.

06:33.180 --> 06:34.080
Humorously,

06:34.080 --> 06:35.510
in the case of Professor X,

06:35.510 --> 06:38.080
some of his students actually had wings.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.530
That's rich.

06:41.270 --> 06:43.440
I'll use that one to lighten the mood

06:43.440 --> 06:46.200
after my entire class fails the midterm.

06:50.190 --> 06:53.290
Measuring starfish serotonin levels in response to

06:53.290 --> 06:57.350
one point two molar stimulation of pleasure cells.

06:59.100 --> 07:00.570
You like that, don't you?

07:02.010 --> 07:03.370
That's right, say my name.

07:09.300 --> 07:11.580
- Hey, what's going on? - Not much.

07:11.650 --> 07:12.910
You want to get a drink later?

07:12.910 --> 07:14.090
Just the two of us?

07:14.160 --> 07:15.050
No Penny?

07:15.050 --> 07:17.520
Not tonight. I'm a little frustrated with her.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.140
Because you got her the job and you think

07:19.140 --> 07:21.300
she should be working harder to prepare for it?

07:21.450 --> 07:24.010
So it's not just me. You see it, too!

07:26.100 --> 07:28.190
I do, I see it.

07:29.300 --> 07:30.790
It's driving me crazy.

07:30.790 --> 07:32.870
Just this afternoon, I saw on Instagram

07:32.870 --> 07:35.130
that instead of studying, she went out to lunch

07:35.130 --> 07:36.890
and got a manicure.

07:37.890 --> 07:39.770
That's outrageous!

07:40.390 --> 07:41.600
I know!

07:41.600 --> 07:42.800
If she doesn't do well,

07:42.800 --> 07:45.200
th-this could reflect poorly on you.

07:45.570 --> 07:48.940
Exactly. Does she not realize it or does she not care?

07:48.940 --> 07:50.190
I don't know.

07:50.260 --> 07:52.670
The important thing is I am here for you

07:52.670 --> 07:56.700
so we can mutually disparage this unpleasing third party.

08:02.810 --> 08:05.510
Hey. We just wanted to see how your class was going.

08:05.510 --> 08:06.890
Where is everybody?

08:07.200 --> 08:08.830
There is no class.

08:08.830 --> 08:11.810
Did you send everyone to the principal's office already?

08:13.650 --> 08:15.290
No one signed up.

08:15.720 --> 08:17.480
Well, that's not your fault.

08:17.780 --> 08:20.460
I called the department secretary to see what happened.

08:20.460 --> 08:24.160
Apparently, I have a reputation for being obnoxious.

08:25.580 --> 08:27.790
What?

08:29.220 --> 08:30.930
Hey, Sheldon, I'm sorry.

08:30.930 --> 08:33.480
No, it's fine.

08:33.820 --> 08:37.240
Now I can devote all my time to dark matter.

08:37.660 --> 08:39.490
Aw, you brought cookies for everyone?

08:39.490 --> 08:41.520
Oh, yes. Fig Newtons.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.540
I was going to ask them: which scientist both helped

08:44.540 --> 08:46.390
to develop calculus

08:46.390 --> 08:48.070
and had a famous cookie named after him?

08:48.070 --> 08:49.870
And then after someone said "Newton,"

08:49.870 --> 08:51.840
I was going to tell them they're wrong.

08:52.950 --> 08:56.020
The cookies are named after a town in Massachusetts.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.680
And then I'd throw the cookies away.

09:00.820 --> 09:02.990
Hey, what if I took your class?

09:04.200 --> 09:05.630
Why would you do that?

09:05.630 --> 09:07.470
- Yeah, why would you do that? - What's wrong with you?

09:08.740 --> 09:10.770
I'm thinking about getting my doctorate,

09:10.770 --> 09:12.280
and he wants to teach... why not?

09:12.280 --> 09:14.120
Oh, Howard.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.810
I appreciate the gesture,

09:15.810 --> 09:18.930
but this is a graduate-level physics class.

09:20.770 --> 09:21.730
I don't think you'd understand

09:21.730 --> 09:23.970
a single thing I was talking about.

09:25.790 --> 09:28.140
Ask why not again; I've got an answer.

09:29.190 --> 09:32.310
Sheldon, I'm more than smart enough to take your class.

09:34.720 --> 09:35.770
No.

09:38.090 --> 09:39.270
Yes.

09:40.700 --> 09:42.950
How would you determine the ground state

09:42.950 --> 09:45.900
of a quantum system with no exact solution?

09:45.900 --> 09:48.360
I would guess a wave-function and then vary its parameters

09:48.360 --> 09:50.710
until I found the lowest energy solution.

09:53.420 --> 09:56.180
Do you know how to integrate X squared times E

09:56.180 --> 09:58.400
to the minus X, without looking it up?

09:58.820 --> 10:00.170
I'd use Feynman's trick...

10:00.170 --> 10:02.040
differentiate under the integral sign.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.880
Okay.

10:06.500 --> 10:10.340
What is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics?

10:10.340 --> 10:12.440
Since every interpretation gives exactly the same answer

10:12.440 --> 10:14.190
to every measurement, they are all equally correct.

10:14.190 --> 10:16.520
However, I know you believe in the Many Worlds Interpretation,

10:16.520 --> 10:19.730
so I'll say that. Now do you think I'm smart enough?

10:22.910 --> 10:24.220
No.

10:25.940 --> 10:27.630
Oh, come on. You might've gone to school

10:27.630 --> 10:29.520
for a couple more years than me, but guess what--

10:29.520 --> 10:32.050
engineers are just as smart as physicists.

10:32.050 --> 10:33.900
You take that back!

10:37.410 --> 10:38.920
No.

10:44.550 --> 10:46.100
So, after drinks with Bernadette,

10:46.100 --> 10:49.090
I get home, and Penny calls to complain about her.

10:49.090 --> 10:50.170
And then while I'm talking to Penny,

10:50.170 --> 10:51.630
I get a text from Bernadette.

10:51.630 --> 10:54.680
Wh... I'm trying to prepare my lesson plan for Howard.

10:54.690 --> 10:56.520
Why are you telling me this?

10:57.660 --> 10:59.180
Because it's taken 15 years,

10:59.180 --> 11:01.870
but high school is finally awesome!

11:04.200 --> 11:05.270
I love them both,

11:05.270 --> 11:08.700
but I'm in the center now, and I love that even more.

11:09.390 --> 11:12.040
Amy, please. I am trying to figure out a way

11:12.040 --> 11:15.560
to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine.

11:16.490 --> 11:18.340
- But I'm just... - Not now.

11:18.810 --> 11:20.000
You better watch that attitude, buddy.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.070
You're dating the popular girl now.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.240
You're up late.

11:28.490 --> 11:31.160
Oh, I'm working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz.

11:31.160 --> 11:33.230
He is going to be so lost.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.560
Look at this section over here.

11:36.100 --> 11:38.080
Even I don't really understand it.

11:39.870 --> 11:42.420
Sheldon, why are you doing this?

11:42.420 --> 11:43.950
I'm a teacher, Leonard.

11:43.950 --> 11:45.280
It's my job.

11:46.440 --> 11:47.430
No, I...I mean,

11:47.430 --> 11:48.820
why are you going to so much trouble

11:48.830 --> 11:50.780
to prove that you're smarter than Wolowitz?

11:50.780 --> 11:53.270
Oh, it's no trouble; it's actually a pleasure.

11:55.280 --> 11:56.620
You want to know what I think?

11:56.880 --> 11:59.960
I think the idea that someone could be as smart as you,

11:59.960 --> 12:02.760
or even smarter, scares the pants off you,

12:02.760 --> 12:04.390
and you can't deal with it.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.900
Interesting point.

12:08.380 --> 12:09.870
Wh... You're suggesting

12:09.870 --> 12:12.140
that I have emotional issues below my consciousness

12:12.140 --> 12:14.010
which drive my behavior,

12:14.010 --> 12:17.150
thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone

12:17.150 --> 12:20.140
that threatens my intellectual superiority.

12:20.570 --> 12:22.410
Might be something to think about.

12:24.210 --> 12:25.340
- Leonard? - Yeah.

12:26.310 --> 12:27.870
Howard's allergic to peanuts.

12:27.870 --> 12:29.550
How can I use that against him?

12:35.650 --> 12:39.060
Okay, now that everyone's here, we can begin.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.810
Before we do, I just talked to Leonard.

12:43.810 --> 12:45.260
And if you're gonna

12:45.260 --> 12:47.540
spend all your time trying to belittle me

12:47.540 --> 12:50.490
by making this class unnecessarily hard,

12:50.500 --> 12:52.450
then I'm out.

12:52.460 --> 12:53.570
But if you're interested in making

12:53.570 --> 12:56.270
a sincere effort to be a good teacher,

12:56.270 --> 12:59.600
then I'm willing to give this a shot.

13:01.830 --> 13:03.980
I suppose that's a fair request.

13:04.430 --> 13:08.260
There's no reason we both can't benefit from this experience.

13:08.260 --> 13:10.320
- Okay. - Okay.

13:12.040 --> 13:13.990
Well, then, uh, first things first.

13:14.490 --> 13:17.030
Um, are you familiar with the Brachistochrone problem?

13:17.030 --> 13:18.330
- I am. - Good.

13:18.330 --> 13:20.960
And how it relates to the calculus of variations?

13:20.960 --> 13:22.510
It's an inverted cycloid.

13:22.510 --> 13:23.430
Wonderful.

13:23.430 --> 13:25.790
Now, what about Euler-Lagrange theorems?

13:25.790 --> 13:27.250
That's where I'm a little fuzzy.

13:27.250 --> 13:29.160
Ha! I knew it! All right.

13:30.360 --> 13:33.980
We have a lot of information to cover before your first test.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.370
Which, by the way, is in eight minutes.

13:36.630 --> 13:39.030
The good news is I'm grading on a curve,

13:39.040 --> 13:41.260
so you're pretty much guaranteed a C.

13:41.870 --> 13:44.840
DJ KHALED - All I Do Is Win

13:41.870 --> 13:43.580
All I do is win, win, win

13:43.580 --> 13:44.840
No matter what

13:44.840 --> 13:45.620
What are you doing?

13:45.620 --> 13:48.170
Everybody hands go up, up...

13:48.170 --> 13:49.980
And they stay there!

13:49.980 --> 13:51.230
What are you doing?

13:51.230 --> 13:53.270
If you're gonna be a crappy teacher,

13:53.270 --> 13:55.290
then I'm gonna be a crappy student.

13:55.880 --> 13:56.840
Ludacris going in on the verse

13:56.840 --> 13:58.390
'Cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now..

13:58.390 --> 13:59.560
Will you stop it!

14:01.550 --> 14:02.770
This is a classroom.

14:02.780 --> 14:05.340
This is not American Bandstand. Okay.

14:05.470 --> 14:06.580
Now, where was I?

14:06.580 --> 14:07.410
Let's see.

14:07.420 --> 14:08.630
Oh, yes. Over here.

14:08.630 --> 14:09.480
You...

14:11.060 --> 14:12.330
What are you doing now?

14:12.330 --> 14:14.590
Making a straw.

14:14.590 --> 14:15.670
Why?

14:15.670 --> 14:18.460
So I can shoot you with a spitball.

14:19.910 --> 14:22.740
You're not going to do that, and I'll tell you why.

14:22.740 --> 14:25.070
This is an institution of higher learning,

14:25.070 --> 14:26.580
I am your professor,

14:26.580 --> 14:28.800
and you're going to treat me with the prop...

14:33.990 --> 14:36.240
You shot your spit in my mouth!

14:38.420 --> 14:39.510
Is that gonna be on the test?

14:39.510 --> 14:41.470
Because I don't think I can do that again.

14:45.510 --> 14:46.800
Hey, girlfriend.

14:46.830 --> 14:48.660
Can I get a what what?

14:50.180 --> 14:51.010
What?

14:52.650 --> 14:53.660
Close enough.

14:53.660 --> 14:56.620
Um, I was just calling to see what you were up tonight.

14:56.620 --> 14:58.700
Thought maybe we could hit up Color Me Mine,

14:58.700 --> 15:01.770
maybe sneak in some Pinot Greej. Whatevs.

15:02.310 --> 15:04.020
Uh, thanks, but I think I'm gonna stay in

15:04.020 --> 15:05.990
and go over the stuff Bernadette gave me.

15:06.010 --> 15:07.800
Oh. Oh, I hear you.

15:07.800 --> 15:10.230
Try and get that nag off your back, right?

15:11.000 --> 15:12.530
I mean, you're not a bicycle;

15:12.530 --> 15:15.090
why's she riding you like that?

15:15.890 --> 15:17.500
No, I think she was just trying to help.

15:17.510 --> 15:19.740
Plus, I really want to do well at this job. So...

15:19.740 --> 15:21.880
Okay, good luck. And call me later,

15:21.880 --> 15:24.750
you know, if you decide she's a bitch or something.

15:30.150 --> 15:31.420
Hey, girlfriend.

15:32.100 --> 15:32.780
Hey, Amy.

15:32.780 --> 15:34.930
Tonight. You, me, Color Me Mine.

15:34.930 --> 15:38.410
Maybe we sneak in some pinot-- make it Color Me Wine.

15:39.700 --> 15:41.300
That sounds fun, but I promised Penny

15:41.300 --> 15:42.970
I'd come by and help her study.

15:42.970 --> 15:45.460
Oh. Well, good luck getting her to do that.

15:45.470 --> 15:47.530
She's probably off getting another manicure.

15:48.500 --> 15:49.760
You remember when she did that?

15:49.760 --> 15:50.820
You remember?

15:52.650 --> 15:54.180
I was probably being too hard on her.

15:54.180 --> 15:55.750
We talked, we're good.

15:55.760 --> 15:57.230
Oh. Great.

15:57.230 --> 15:58.710
I'm happy for you guys.

15:58.710 --> 16:00.600
You know, when the two of you aren't getting along,

16:00.600 --> 16:02.650
it puts me in a really weird position.

16:03.780 --> 16:05.900
Well, don't worry-- everything's back to normal.

16:05.900 --> 16:07.310
You mean, like, where she's nice to your face?

16:07.310 --> 16:08.670
Okay got it. Bye.

16:13.270 --> 16:14.520
Hey, boyfriend.

16:15.110 --> 16:16.450
Can't talk. Spitball.

16:16.450 --> 16:17.860
Probably gonna die.

16:25.720 --> 16:26.560
Well?

16:26.560 --> 16:28.310
Sheldon, I-I promise.

16:28.310 --> 16:30.900
Your uvula does not have an STD.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.040
Are you sure?

16:35.450 --> 16:38.190
It just doesn't feel as innocent as it used to.

16:41.410 --> 16:43.990
You reported me to human resources?

16:44.600 --> 16:47.460
You violated the sanctity of my mouth.

16:48.320 --> 16:51.120
Well, I dropped your class, so I hope you're happy.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.420
I told you you weren't smart enough to take it.

16:53.420 --> 16:54.850
I'm smart enough, Sheldon.

16:54.850 --> 16:55.770
Asking me a bunch of questions

16:55.770 --> 16:56.900
about a topic I'm not familiar with

16:56.900 --> 16:57.700
doesn't prove anything.

16:57.700 --> 16:59.130
I could do the same to you.

16:59.140 --> 17:00.880
Yeah... Try me.

17:01.280 --> 17:02.460
Okay.

17:02.830 --> 17:06.540
You enjoy making fun of engineering so much;

17:06.540 --> 17:09.950
how do you quantify the strength of materials?

17:09.950 --> 17:11.610
Young's modulus.

17:12.260 --> 17:13.760
- Is that right? - Yeah.

17:17.060 --> 17:20.630
Okay, how do you prevent eddy currents in a transformer?

17:20.630 --> 17:22.620
Laminate the core material.

17:22.620 --> 17:23.700
Come on, give him a hard one.

17:23.700 --> 17:25.080
That was a hard one.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.020
All right.

17:28.070 --> 17:32.410
How does the flow rate in a pipe depend on its diameter?

17:33.490 --> 17:36.260
You don't know, do you?

17:38.130 --> 17:39.550
What's the matter, smart guy?

17:39.740 --> 17:41.440
Don't know Poiseuille's law?

17:48.480 --> 17:50.700
Thank goodness I got it!

17:54.060 --> 17:56.260
Now I can quit checking my stool.

18:00.430 --> 18:02.720
Okay, what are the potential side effects

18:02.720 --> 18:04.980
for our erectile dysfunction drug?

18:04.980 --> 18:07.570
Headaches, dizziness and nausea.

18:07.600 --> 18:08.530
Yes.

18:08.540 --> 18:09.690
Those are also the side effects

18:09.690 --> 18:13.040
of having a 75-year-old man with an erection climb on top of you.

18:14.790 --> 18:17.030
- Want to stop here? - Uh, no. I can keep going.

18:17.030 --> 18:18.200
Nah, you got this.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.720
Let's go for a drink. I'll call Amy.

18:19.720 --> 18:22.720
Okay, good. She seemed like she really wanted to go out tonight.

18:32.020 --> 18:32.940
Hey, girl.

18:38.750 --> 18:42.450
Okay, next question, for the Butterfinger:

18:42.830 --> 18:45.140
how long is a galactic year?

18:45.140 --> 18:46.460
250 million years!

18:46.460 --> 18:47.380
Yes!

18:50.520 --> 18:54.640
Okay, this one is for a Cadbury Creme Egg.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.200
It's not even Easter time.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.530
This is crazy!

18:59.710 --> 19:03.880
Which Archimedean solid has 20 regular triangular faces,

19:03.890 --> 19:06.400
30 square faces, 12 pentagonal faces,

19:06.400 --> 19:10.340
60 vertices and 120 edges?

19:10.420 --> 19:12.810
The Rhombicosidodecahedron!

19:12.810 --> 19:15.000
Yes!

19:15.750 --> 19:17.660
We are so smart!

19:17.670 --> 19:19.610
Why didn't girls like us in high school?

19:19.610 --> 19:20.710
Because we were awkward and weird

19:20.710 --> 19:22.840
- and couldn't play sports! - Right again!
