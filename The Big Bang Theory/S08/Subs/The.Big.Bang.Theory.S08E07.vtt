WEBVTT

00:03.940 --> 00:05.570
So, what are you working on these days?

00:05.570 --> 00:07.510
I'm studying one-celled organisms

00:07.510 --> 00:09.120
to try and find the neurochemicals

00:09.120 --> 00:11.120
that lead to the feeling of shame.

00:11.120 --> 00:13.930
What would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about?

00:13.930 --> 00:17.320
Same as all of us, getting out of a car without underwear.

00:18.690 --> 00:20.010
Speaking of underwear,

00:20.010 --> 00:21.740
I have some interesting news...

00:21.740 --> 00:23.790
Okay, if it's sometimes Howie wears yours,

00:23.790 --> 00:25.900
Leonard already told us.

00:27.150 --> 00:29.050
He was being funny.

00:29.590 --> 00:31.710
I'm pretty sure.

00:32.810 --> 00:35.720
Anyway, I was asked to be a part of a magazine article

00:35.720 --> 00:38.950
about the 50 sexiest female scientists in California.

00:38.950 --> 00:40.220
Isn't that cool?

00:40.220 --> 00:41.630
I think it's awful.

00:41.630 --> 00:43.050
Why would you say that?

00:43.050 --> 00:45.980
Bernadette is a successful microbiologist.

00:45.980 --> 00:48.640
She should be celebrated for her achievements, not her looks.

00:48.640 --> 00:50.630
I mean, what kind of message does that send?

00:50.630 --> 00:54.290
I think the message is-- "Check out the rack on that scientist."

00:55.960 --> 00:59.610
Why can't someone be thought of as both smart and pretty?

00:59.610 --> 01:01.820
I just don't think a professional woman should have

01:01.820 --> 01:04.570
to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead.

01:04.570 --> 01:05.690
Okay, what's the big deal?

01:05.690 --> 01:07.350
Look, if it helps me make a sale with a physician,

01:07.350 --> 01:09.130
I don't think it hurts to flirt a little.

01:09.130 --> 01:11.940
I mean, laugh at their joke, touch their arm,

01:11.940 --> 01:14.160
maybe crank up the AC in the car beforehand, you know,

01:14.160 --> 01:16.250
to wake up the girls.

01:18.250 --> 01:20.060
Maybe it's different in the world of sales,

01:20.060 --> 01:22.060
but it's already hard enough for women

01:22.060 --> 01:24.680
to be taken seriously in science.

01:24.680 --> 01:26.380
I was kind of excited about the article,

01:26.380 --> 01:28.020
but now you're making me feel bad.

01:28.020 --> 01:30.100
No, I think you should do whatever you want.

01:30.100 --> 01:33.000
You know, maybe if fashion magazines had female scientists in them,

01:33.000 --> 01:35.990
I would've become a theoretical physicist.

01:37.610 --> 01:39.890
Stop smirking at each other.

02:14.800 --> 02:15.530
Thank you.

02:15.530 --> 02:17.750
No, thank you.

02:17.750 --> 02:20.650
Delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers

02:20.650 --> 02:22.530
of our nation's commerce.

02:23.260 --> 02:24.740
It's because of people like you,

02:24.740 --> 02:28.110
people like me can limit our human contact.

02:28.780 --> 02:32.350
I'd shake your hand, but, well, you know.

02:33.110 --> 02:35.690
I'm not a delivery man, I-I'm a doctor.

02:35.690 --> 02:37.430
Although I do often deliver

02:37.430 --> 02:41.110
alarming biopsy results to my patients.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.350
That's humorous.

02:45.880 --> 02:47.210
All right.

02:49.250 --> 02:52.830
Yeah, I-I bet you leave your patients in stitches.

02:55.380 --> 02:57.560
That was also humorous.

02:59.050 --> 03:00.400
All right.

03:02.320 --> 03:04.580
Are you bringing flowers to a patient

03:04.580 --> 03:07.800
to cushion the blow of a terminal diagnosis?

03:13.160 --> 03:15.280
That wasn't a joke.

03:15.840 --> 03:17.360
All right.

03:19.120 --> 03:20.790
These are actually for a nice woman

03:20.790 --> 03:22.910
who makes sales calls to my office.

03:24.790 --> 03:27.520
You know, they have delivery people that will do that for you.

03:29.110 --> 03:31.090
I was hoping to impress her

03:31.090 --> 03:32.700
by tracking her down on the Internet

03:32.700 --> 03:35.690
and then showing up unannounced at her door.

03:38.020 --> 03:39.360
Making the extra effort.

03:39.360 --> 03:40.880
Good for you.

03:50.140 --> 03:51.840
Great timing, food just got here.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.570
- Ooh, Siam Palace? - Yes.

03:53.570 --> 03:55.360
- Uh, mee krob and chicken satay? - Yes.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.840
- Uh, extra peanut sauce? - No, but you can have mine.

03:57.840 --> 03:59.500
Eh, well, very well.

04:00.200 --> 04:03.760
Oh, and on the topic of sharing things that are yours,

04:04.450 --> 04:05.850
there is a gentleman caller

04:05.850 --> 04:09.210
bringing flowers to your fiancee as we speak.

04:09.770 --> 04:10.640
What?

04:11.450 --> 04:13.990
Why didn't you say that first?

04:13.990 --> 04:16.890
Why didn't you get extra peanut sauce?

04:17.730 --> 04:19.720
We can both play this game.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.540
Can I help you?

04:21.960 --> 04:22.740
Oh, hi.

04:22.740 --> 04:24.550
Uh, does Penny live here?

04:24.550 --> 04:26.790
May I ask why?

04:28.280 --> 04:31.410
I-I met her at my office, she winked at me.

04:33.210 --> 04:38.270
I-I came hoping to initiate a romantic relationship.

04:41.760 --> 04:44.310
Look, I'm pretty sure she didn't wink at you.

04:44.310 --> 04:45.710
Oh, she did.

04:47.090 --> 04:49.280
Seductively, like this.

04:52.630 --> 04:55.000
And then she touched my arm for two Mississippis.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.080
Like, you know, one Mississippi, two...

04:57.080 --> 04:58.790
I got it, I got it.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.220
Listen, um...

05:02.220 --> 05:04.860
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

05:04.860 --> 05:07.570
See, Penny is my fiancee.

05:07.570 --> 05:09.300
Really?

05:11.050 --> 05:14.130
I've never seen her wear an engagement ring.

05:14.130 --> 05:16.090
Really?

05:20.550 --> 05:22.450
So, am I to presume

05:22.450 --> 05:25.400
that her flirtation was just a sales technique?

05:25.400 --> 05:26.880
I think so.

05:27.270 --> 05:29.400
When will I learn?

05:30.090 --> 05:34.080
It's just like the cute girl at the pet store all over again.

05:34.860 --> 05:36.210
Excuse me?

05:36.720 --> 05:39.650
Oh, uh, she touched my arm for five Mississippis,

05:39.650 --> 05:43.320
and I bought a $2,000 iguana habitat.

05:45.160 --> 05:49.130
Which she was always too busy to come over and see.

05:50.540 --> 05:52.490
You give these to Penny.

05:53.750 --> 05:55.950
You're, you're a lucky man.

05:56.340 --> 05:57.610
Thank you.

05:57.940 --> 05:58.920
Sorry.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.230
You probably don't want her to see this.

06:02.230 --> 06:05.490
It's unnecessarily graphic.

06:07.560 --> 06:08.600
Hold on, Doctor.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.410
Leonard, where are your social skills?

06:11.410 --> 06:13.350
This man is clearly upset.

06:13.350 --> 06:16.420
We should invite him in for a hot beverage.

06:19.030 --> 06:20.790
He tried to score with Penny.

06:20.790 --> 06:24.090
So have these two, and they're having dinner with us.

06:29.830 --> 06:32.070
So, how was work today?

06:32.070 --> 06:34.120
It was fine, but you'll be happy to know

06:34.120 --> 06:36.470
they pulled the sexy scientists article.

06:36.470 --> 06:37.820
What happened?

06:37.820 --> 06:38.970
I don't know.

06:38.970 --> 06:40.350
They just canceled the photo shoot

06:40.350 --> 06:42.570
and said they're rethinking it.

06:42.570 --> 06:43.550
Well, I'm really sorry,

06:43.550 --> 06:46.520
but I think it's for the best.

06:46.520 --> 06:48.440
You want people focusing on your achievements,

06:48.440 --> 06:51.120
not staring at your breasts in some magazine.

06:51.120 --> 06:52.000
I guess.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.080
It's really not that important.

06:54.790 --> 06:57.040
Hey, up here.

06:58.430 --> 07:01.030
Sorry, we're... we were talking about them.

07:03.200 --> 07:06.390
So, look, I-I wasn't going to say anything,

07:06.390 --> 07:08.850
but since you seem to be okay with the article being canceled,

07:08.850 --> 07:10.650
I have a little confession.

07:10.650 --> 07:12.850
I'm the reason it was pulled.

07:12.850 --> 07:14.790
What? How?

07:14.790 --> 07:16.420
I sent the editors of the magazine

07:16.420 --> 07:18.480
a pretty scathing e-mail.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.170
Amy, what did you say?

07:20.170 --> 07:21.510
I simply pointed out

07:21.510 --> 07:23.470
that they would never consider doing an article

07:23.470 --> 07:25.750
ranking male scientists on their sexuality,

07:25.750 --> 07:28.790
let alone showing them in various stages of undress.

07:28.790 --> 07:30.810
Because no one wants to see Neil deGrasse Tyson

07:30.810 --> 07:34.080
in a wet T-shirt, bent over the hood of a Porsche.

07:36.390 --> 07:37.620
Well, it doesn't make a difference,

07:37.620 --> 07:39.850
because they agreed it was in bad taste,

07:39.850 --> 07:42.370
and now you agree, so...

07:42.700 --> 07:44.810
Amy saves the day.

07:45.870 --> 07:47.720
No, what happened was you got jealous,

07:47.720 --> 07:50.560
so you took away a chance for me to get some publicity.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.240
But it was bad publicity.

07:52.240 --> 07:54.450
That's for me to decide, not you.

07:54.450 --> 07:55.970
I disagree.

07:55.970 --> 07:59.920
As a female scientist, I think what you do affects all of us.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.400
And I think you don't like people expressing their sexuality

08:02.400 --> 08:05.190
because no one wants you to express yours.

08:06.980 --> 08:08.560
Oh, Amy, I'm so sorry.

08:08.560 --> 08:10.200
That was over the line.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.400
You have a nice night.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.480
Please don't go.

08:13.480 --> 08:16.780
Up until my vicious attack, you were the one in the wrong.

08:20.210 --> 08:21.730
Here you go, Doctor.

08:21.730 --> 08:24.650
Red Zinger with one teaspoon of honey.

08:24.650 --> 08:25.470
Thank you.

08:25.470 --> 08:27.600
Neat Star Trek mug.

08:27.600 --> 08:30.790
I actually have one of the phasers from the original TV show.

08:30.790 --> 08:32.080
Oh, cool.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.440
How'd you get that?

08:33.440 --> 08:36.530
Oh, easy, Gene Roddenberry needed a vasectomy.

08:37.990 --> 08:39.290
Wait a minute.

08:39.290 --> 08:42.460
You've snipped Gene Roddenberry's vas deferens?

08:43.120 --> 08:44.380
Yes.

08:44.380 --> 08:47.930
Wow, he really went where no man has gone before.

08:50.550 --> 08:53.030
I don't like to brag, but, uh, you see,

08:53.030 --> 08:58.120
I'm kind of the doctor to the stars' urinary tracts.

09:03.310 --> 09:07.170
Uh, you, you want to see James Cameron's kidney stone?

09:13.010 --> 09:14.520
He was so happy after he passed it,

09:14.520 --> 09:17.160
he gave me a Terminator.

09:17.680 --> 09:18.900
That is amazing.

09:18.900 --> 09:20.690
How long have you been collecting?

09:20.690 --> 09:21.990
Ever since I was a kid,

09:21.990 --> 09:23.780
but, uh, I didn't really get serious

09:23.780 --> 09:28.170
until William Shatner's bladder infection.

09:28.250 --> 09:29.930
What'd you get? What'd you get?

09:30.650 --> 09:32.110
Well, he said it was a tribble.

09:32.110 --> 09:33.200
It could be a toupee,

09:33.200 --> 09:35.260
but either way, it's pretty cool.

09:37.120 --> 09:39.400
I-I would love to see your collection.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.800
Anytime.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.560
Uh, I've got some cool stuff.

09:42.560 --> 09:43.580
When I first started,

09:43.580 --> 09:45.510
I thought it would be a good way to meet women,

09:45.510 --> 09:48.250
but, well, you know...

09:48.950 --> 09:50.790
- Sure. - Preach.

09:52.180 --> 09:54.400
Can I ask you a personal question?

09:54.610 --> 09:55.670
Sure.

09:55.670 --> 10:00.210
Um, I mean, you're a guy like me,

10:00.210 --> 10:03.270
so how'd you get a girl like Penny?

10:05.060 --> 10:07.130
Well, you know, just...

10:07.130 --> 10:09.820
being myself, really.

10:09.820 --> 10:11.140
Oh, please!

10:11.140 --> 10:12.840
You know, I'll tell you how he did it.

10:12.840 --> 10:16.430
Implacable, relentless badgering.

10:17.010 --> 10:18.480
In urology terms,

10:18.480 --> 10:21.420
he was a drug-resistant staph infection.

10:21.420 --> 10:25.030
And she was a urethra that could not shake him.

10:27.690 --> 10:30.370
I don't know that I'd call myself an infection.

10:30.910 --> 10:32.150
A gallant man would defend

10:32.150 --> 10:35.130
his fiancee for being called a urethra.

10:36.480 --> 10:38.420
Can we please change the subject?

10:39.330 --> 10:42.000
Well, that didn't go your way.

10:44.280 --> 10:46.980
Dr. Lorvis, what are you doing here?

10:46.980 --> 10:49.530
Uh, well, actually I came to see you.

10:49.530 --> 10:50.750
Really? Why?

10:50.780 --> 10:53.200
Ah, that's a good question.

10:54.370 --> 10:56.920
Apparently someone was being awfully flirty

10:56.920 --> 10:58.600
while not wearing their engagement ring,

10:58.600 --> 11:00.100
causing another someone to show up here

11:00.100 --> 11:02.200
thinking the first someone might be available.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.790
Oh, God. Don't make it so hard on her.

11:03.790 --> 11:07.010
Look, the first someone is the deceitful you.

11:07.010 --> 11:08.890
The second someone

11:08.890 --> 11:11.590
is the delightful Dr. Lorvis.

11:12.080 --> 11:14.020
Oh, this is very embarrassing.

11:14.070 --> 11:15.540
Dr. Lorvis, I am so sorry.

11:15.540 --> 11:18.030
I did not mean to lead you on.

11:18.030 --> 11:21.280
You touched my arm for two Mississippis.

11:22.550 --> 11:25.580
That's why you were mumbling "Mississippi."

11:26.420 --> 11:27.460
Can we talk in private?

11:27.460 --> 11:28.600
Please, yes.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.880
I'll be right back.

11:32.290 --> 11:36.100
So what other celebrity genitalia have you handled?

11:37.470 --> 11:38.960
So, uh, what's the deal?

11:38.960 --> 11:41.010
You take off your ring when you go to work?

11:41.010 --> 11:42.340
What? No! No!

11:42.340 --> 11:44.390
I just put it on the other hand and...

11:44.890 --> 11:46.620
turn it around.

11:47.080 --> 11:49.100
Keep that hand in my pocket.

11:49.740 --> 11:50.670
Why?

11:50.670 --> 11:51.600
Well, what do you mean why?

11:51.600 --> 11:52.700
Look, I make more sales

11:52.700 --> 11:54.090
if these doctors think I'm single.

11:54.090 --> 11:55.840
I did the same kind of thing as a waitress.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.250
The real question is, what is he doing in your apartment?

11:58.250 --> 11:59.560
Oh, he was upset.

11:59.560 --> 12:02.890
So Sheldon invited him in for a hot beverage.

12:03.570 --> 12:04.560
You were okay with that?

12:04.560 --> 12:06.150
No. I got upset!

12:06.150 --> 12:08.820
And Sheldon made me a beverage, too.

12:09.290 --> 12:10.720
Okay, he just showed up at my door.

12:10.720 --> 12:12.350
Don't you think that's a little weird?

12:12.350 --> 12:14.890
A little, but... he's basically harmless.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.900
- He's actually kind of a nice guy. - Okay.

12:16.900 --> 12:18.720
Whatever, look, my company does not allow me

12:18.720 --> 12:20.350
to socialize with doctors outside of work.

12:20.350 --> 12:21.610
You got to get rid of him.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.320
Why am I the one that has to get rid of him?

12:23.320 --> 12:25.680
I can't do it! He's my best client!

12:26.540 --> 12:28.230
All right, I'll get rid of him.

12:28.230 --> 12:30.420
But you owe me one.

12:30.420 --> 12:32.640
Hey, we're going to Oliver's house to see his collection.

12:32.640 --> 12:33.310
You want to go with us?

12:33.310 --> 12:34.930
Yeah, sure.

12:36.410 --> 12:38.320
You owe me.

12:48.220 --> 12:50.890
Oh, my God!

12:52.620 --> 12:54.250
Leonard, I was wrong.

12:54.250 --> 12:56.460
Heaven does exist.

12:57.150 --> 12:59.070
And it's in the basement of a urologist's house

12:59.070 --> 13:01.120
in Sherman Oaks.

13:02.810 --> 13:05.800
Welcome to my Fortress of Solitude.

13:06.270 --> 13:08.250
This is where I go to get away from...

13:09.210 --> 13:12.190
all my other solitude.

13:13.310 --> 13:15.420
Oh, come on. It's a replica.

13:15.420 --> 13:16.600
Original.

13:17.350 --> 13:20.040
Oh, I think I just cheated on my wife.

13:22.920 --> 13:24.720
The gun from Hellboy?

13:24.720 --> 13:25.500
Yup.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.730
How did you get it?

13:26.730 --> 13:27.890
Bought it at auction.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.940
Oh, I was hoping for a juicy tidbit

13:29.940 --> 13:32.560
about Ron Perlman's testicles.

13:34.250 --> 13:36.630
Oliver! I'm going to play bingo!

13:36.630 --> 13:38.870
Okay, Mother. Have fun.

13:38.870 --> 13:40.010
Still lives with his mom.

13:40.010 --> 13:41.800
Yikes, right?

13:43.840 --> 13:47.030
Yeah, I'm not quite sure how to respond.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.150
Wow, Donkey Kong!

13:50.150 --> 13:52.550
This-this was my game when I was a kid!

13:52.550 --> 13:54.930
Because it's a story of a pretty blonde girl

13:54.930 --> 13:58.620
tirelessly pursued by a small, oddly-shaped man?

14:01.240 --> 14:03.210
No, because I liked it.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.190
Well, now, don't get defensive.

14:05.190 --> 14:08.570
You're oddly-shaped, but you got the girl.

14:10.190 --> 14:12.000
So, I've noticed Leonard gets teased a lot

14:12.000 --> 14:14.180
about his relationship with Penny.

14:14.180 --> 14:16.520
Yes. If you'd like to join in,

14:16.520 --> 14:20.830
the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure.

14:21.780 --> 14:24.330
So, you think she'll be single soon?

14:24.330 --> 14:26.250
Oh, if you want to get in on the pool,

14:26.250 --> 14:27.620
you're too late...

14:27.620 --> 14:30.560
All the squares have been purchased.

14:31.380 --> 14:32.380
Interesting.

14:32.380 --> 14:35.040
Excuse me, I have to take care of something.

14:45.110 --> 14:46.490
Leonard, as your friend I feel

14:46.490 --> 14:49.020
- I should tell you something. - What?

14:49.020 --> 14:51.810
I'm still upset about that peanut sauce.

14:55.860 --> 14:57.020
Oh, could you hold the door?

14:57.480 --> 14:59.050
- Nice flowers. - Thank you.

14:59.050 --> 15:00.160
They're for a girl.

15:00.160 --> 15:03.130
Uh, I'm being implacable and relentless.

15:04.680 --> 15:06.660
Isn't she lucky?

15:08.300 --> 15:10.090
She keeps sending me mixed signals.

15:10.090 --> 15:12.660
But I-I think we both want the same thing.

15:12.660 --> 15:13.650
What's that?

15:13.650 --> 15:15.600
Unconditional love.

15:16.460 --> 15:18.250
I guess that's all anybody wants.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.470
I guess so.

15:19.470 --> 15:22.790
Well, I hope you get it.

15:22.790 --> 15:25.430
One Mississippi, two Mississippi.

15:33.570 --> 15:35.340
Next game, let's switch helmets.

15:36.090 --> 15:38.340
No, I'd look silly in that helmet.

15:43.690 --> 15:45.670
I-I can't take these.

15:45.670 --> 15:46.730
Well, why not?

15:46.730 --> 15:48.180
I mean, you want what I want.

15:48.180 --> 15:51.070
And we had two wonderful Mississippis.

15:53.380 --> 15:55.340
But what about the other girl?

15:55.340 --> 15:56.260
Oh, right.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.810
I'll tell her we should just be friends.

16:06.150 --> 16:07.450
Dr. Lorvis?

16:07.450 --> 16:10.230
Penny, we should just be friends.

16:11.950 --> 16:13.830
Happy?

16:23.490 --> 16:24.950
You think he bites?

16:25.540 --> 16:27.700
Stick your hand in there and find out.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.410
You fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo.

16:31.410 --> 16:33.330
You will not fool me again.

16:35.460 --> 16:36.690
I wonder where Dr. Lorvis is.

16:36.690 --> 16:38.110
He's been gone a while.

16:38.480 --> 16:41.180
Maybe he's playing bingo with his mommy.

16:42.190 --> 16:45.740
It's sad how some guys can't cut the apron strings.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.340
Okay, now you're messing with me.

16:50.990 --> 16:53.790
Uh, guys, we're locked in here.

16:54.550 --> 16:57.010
Oh, this day just keeps getting better!

17:00.850 --> 17:04.040
So, you just left them alone playing games in your house?

17:04.040 --> 17:05.990
Well, they seemed happy and...

17:06.460 --> 17:07.990
I thought that would give me time

17:07.990 --> 17:10.620
for you and I to get to know each other better.

17:13.100 --> 17:15.250
That was before we met.

17:17.720 --> 17:19.590
We all have a past.

17:20.910 --> 17:22.220
Doc, you've got to see what you're doing

17:22.220 --> 17:23.930
is-is a little creepy.

17:23.930 --> 17:25.580
You sound just like Sigourney Weaver

17:25.580 --> 17:28.260
when I followed her into a restroom.

17:29.720 --> 17:31.320
Okay, you can't just go chasing after

17:31.320 --> 17:33.000
every girl who's nice to you.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.860
Well, that's not what Sheldon says.

17:34.860 --> 17:37.490
And he seems to know his way around the ladies.

17:42.320 --> 17:45.220
Hey, Leonard. Guess who's back! Dr. Lorvis!

17:45.220 --> 17:47.230
Yeah. You care to join us?

17:47.230 --> 17:48.280
What?!

17:48.280 --> 17:50.520
You locked them in your basement?!

17:51.250 --> 17:53.090
Well, they're, they're not locked in.

17:53.090 --> 17:54.670
The door just sticks.

17:54.670 --> 17:57.390
Okay, so how do they unstick it?

17:57.390 --> 17:59.720
They'd need the key.

18:02.840 --> 18:03.370
Okay.

18:03.370 --> 18:04.570
Nope. That's it.

18:04.570 --> 18:06.420
We are gonna go over there right now.

18:06.420 --> 18:08.480
And you are going to let them out.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.530
- Three Mississippi, four Mississippi... - Move it!

18:16.560 --> 18:17.600
Oh, good, you're here.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.610
Amy, I am so sorry.

18:19.610 --> 18:21.380
That has to wait. This weirdo locked

18:21.380 --> 18:23.260
- the guys up in his basement. - What?!

18:23.260 --> 18:25.860
- She seems nice. Who's she? - Just walk.

18:32.480 --> 18:33.770
You can do this.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.110
One ladder left!

18:37.530 --> 18:38.820
- Oh-ho! Yeah! - Yes!

18:38.820 --> 18:39.760
Next level!

18:39.760 --> 18:41.740
- Leonard, are you okay? - Better than okay.

18:41.740 --> 18:44.400
I am having the game of my life!

18:45.770 --> 18:48.300
Dr. Lorvis, isn't there something you want to say?

18:48.300 --> 18:48.910
Yes.

18:48.910 --> 18:51.200
I'm very sorry for locking you in my home.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.490
Yeah, that was very uncool.

18:52.490 --> 18:53.660
Get the hammer! Get the hammer!

18:53.660 --> 18:54.790
Got it.

18:57.350 --> 18:58.930
Okay, Leonard, let's go!

18:58.930 --> 19:00.930
J-Just hang on!

19:01.710 --> 19:02.880
Well, while we wait,

19:02.880 --> 19:06.730
would you like to see Tobey Maguire's prostate sonogram?

19:07.390 --> 19:08.680
Sure. Yeah.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.110
Oh, spoiler alert.

19:10.110 --> 19:12.740
Uh, he was worried about nothing.
