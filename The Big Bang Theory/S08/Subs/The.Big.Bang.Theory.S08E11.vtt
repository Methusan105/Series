WEBVTT

00:03.930 --> 00:05.870
Hey, how are things going with your parents?

00:05.870 --> 00:08.340
Not great. They hired divorce attorneys.

00:08.340 --> 00:10.300
You know, speaking of attorneys,

00:10.300 --> 00:12.780
if I ever needed a lawyer,

00:12.780 --> 00:17.200
I would not hire She-Hulk.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.200
You know what? That was almost on topic.

00:19.200 --> 00:21.560
I'm gonna say, "Good job, Sheldon."

00:22.140 --> 00:24.190
Wait, She-Hulk's a lawyer?

00:24.190 --> 00:26.180
Yeah, she works at a law firm in New York.

00:26.180 --> 00:29.600
Yes, but she's the only monster at the firm.

00:29.600 --> 00:31.430
Between you, me and the wall,

00:31.430 --> 00:35.790
I think she's an affirmative action hire.

00:35.730 --> 00:37.790
Anyway, Dad's gonna be here in town,

00:37.790 --> 00:40.390
so I won't be able to do Christmas dinner this year.

00:40.390 --> 00:42.580
If you're not up to hosting Christmas dinner,

00:42.580 --> 00:43.690
I'm happy to do it.

00:43.690 --> 00:45.640
You can even bring your father.

00:45.640 --> 00:47.040
That would be nice.

00:47.040 --> 00:50.010
I've always wanted to do a traditional Victorian Christmas.

00:50.010 --> 00:54.180
Parlor games, goose and figgy pudding...

00:55.570 --> 00:57.020
English pudding.

00:57.020 --> 00:58.920
Y-You get yourself all excited for pudding,

00:58.920 --> 01:02.130
and here comes a cake with raisins in it.

01:02.530 --> 01:03.750
I'm not going.

01:03.750 --> 01:04.890
You're going.

01:04.890 --> 01:06.930
Why do you hate me?

01:07.540 --> 01:08.580
I don't hate you.

01:08.580 --> 01:09.620
I love you.

01:09.620 --> 01:11.330
Well, you call it love,

01:11.330 --> 01:13.910
but it has a lot of raisins in it.

01:14.900 --> 01:17.030
Amy, good luck getting these guys excited

01:17.030 --> 01:18.500
about a dinner with a theme.

01:18.500 --> 01:22.340
I gave up when no one cared about my Tom Hanks-giving.

01:24.040 --> 01:26.320
I think a Victorian Christmas sounds nice.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.390
- I agree. - Me, too.

01:27.390 --> 01:29.560
You guys suck!

01:57.110 --> 01:59.390
You know the best part of working in the clean room?

01:59.390 --> 02:00.670
No allergies.

02:00.670 --> 02:01.860
Check it out.

02:04.680 --> 02:07.500
Oh, that-that... that's a lot of oxygen.

02:08.750 --> 02:10.550
We should get going to Amy's.

02:10.680 --> 02:12.040
Can you believe there was a time

02:12.040 --> 02:13.550
when we would have needed an array

02:13.550 --> 02:16.570
of giant Cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles?

02:16.570 --> 02:19.570
And here we are building our own multi-wire detector

02:19.570 --> 02:22.520
like a couple of badasses.

02:23.460 --> 02:24.780
I know. If we were still single,

02:24.780 --> 02:27.930
we'd be tripping over all that booty.

02:28.460 --> 02:32.470
Ladies do love a man dressed like a kitchen garbage bag.

02:38.150 --> 02:39.930
Oh, no.

02:41.350 --> 02:42.800
How the hell did a pigeon get in here?

02:42.800 --> 02:45.020
- You shut the loading doors, right? - I thought you did.

02:45.020 --> 02:47.230
Do you know what a disaster this is?!

02:47.230 --> 02:49.310
You mean 'cause this room isn't supposed to have dust in it,

02:49.310 --> 02:52.280
and we just let in a flying crap machine?!

02:53.440 --> 02:55.100
What do we do? Should we call someone?

02:55.100 --> 02:57.840
And tell them that we compromised all the equipment?

02:57.840 --> 03:00.810
Let's just get it out of here before anyone knows.

03:00.810 --> 03:01.980
Okay, how do we catch it?

03:01.980 --> 03:04.160
Well, what if we turn off all the lights

03:04.160 --> 03:06.530
except for one, and it'll come to it.

03:07.740 --> 03:09.820
It's not a moth!

03:11.170 --> 03:12.500
Don't yell at me.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.970
You're not gonna get any good ideas out of me if you're yelling.

03:14.970 --> 03:16.450
Okay, so if I remain calm,

03:16.450 --> 03:19.690
I'll get more gems like, "Turn off the lights"?!

03:20.580 --> 03:21.530
Great, we're turning on each other.

03:21.530 --> 03:24.170
That's just what the bird wants us to do!

03:26.160 --> 03:28.940
So, Dr. Koothrappali, long flight?

03:28.940 --> 03:31.360
- 20 hours. - Oh, that's rough.

03:31.360 --> 03:32.500
Not at all.

03:32.500 --> 03:35.490
Did you know that when you fly transcontinental without your wife,

03:35.490 --> 03:38.190
you don't pray for the plane to crash?

03:40.450 --> 03:43.120
Can you please talk about anything else?

03:43.120 --> 03:44.460
Forgive me.

03:44.870 --> 03:45.950
How are you and Leonard?

03:45.950 --> 03:47.640
Oh, great. Everything's good.

03:47.640 --> 03:50.310
- I see you got engaged. - Yes, we did.

03:50.310 --> 03:51.670
Let me tell you a story.

03:51.670 --> 03:52.650
Dad!

03:54.040 --> 03:55.120
Sorry.

03:55.120 --> 03:58.030
I'm sure you won't grow to hate each other.

04:01.870 --> 04:03.940
Hey, Leonard. What's up?

04:03.940 --> 04:07.450
What? How did that happen?

04:07.450 --> 04:09.390
Yeah, okay. I'll be there as soon as I can.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.950
Sorry. I have to run to the university.

04:11.950 --> 04:13.030
What's going on?

04:13.030 --> 04:15.670
There's been a problem with our experiment.

04:15.670 --> 04:18.220
A bird got into the clean room.

04:18.790 --> 04:19.700
You want me to come?

04:19.700 --> 04:21.220
Uh, no. You had a long flight.

04:21.220 --> 04:22.840
You stay here and relax.

04:22.840 --> 04:25.170
"Relax." Easy for you to say.

04:25.170 --> 04:28.120
Your mother isn't cleaning out your bank account.

04:28.120 --> 04:31.460
40 years, the woman never cleaned a thing.

04:32.290 --> 04:33.340
You're just gonna leave him here?

04:33.340 --> 04:36.110
- "Relax," He says. - Yup. Bye.

04:38.740 --> 04:41.020
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus

04:41.020 --> 04:43.500
Right down Santa Claus Lane

04:43.500 --> 04:46.040
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer

04:46.040 --> 04:47.810
Pulling on the reins...

04:47.810 --> 04:49.200
Yeah, I appreciate the ride...

04:49.200 --> 04:50.940
Bells are ringing, children singing

04:50.940 --> 04:53.250
All is merry and bright

04:53.250 --> 04:55.800
So hang your stockings and say your prayers

04:55.800 --> 04:57.780
'Cause Santa Claus is coming tonight...

05:00.140 --> 05:01.510
Why'd you turn it off?

05:01.510 --> 05:04.330
Because in the last ten minutes, Santa came to town,

05:04.330 --> 05:05.410
kissed Mommy

05:05.410 --> 05:07.830
and ran Grandma over with a reindeer.

05:08.270 --> 05:10.370
I had a drunk uncle who did all those things.

05:10.370 --> 05:12.800
Nobody sings songs about him.

05:13.660 --> 05:16.310
Maybe you'd like it more if you thought of Santa as a superhero

05:16.310 --> 05:18.900
and his power is bringing joy to children.

05:18.900 --> 05:21.560
My uncle was accused of that, too.

05:21.940 --> 05:24.550
It turned out to be legal in Oklahoma.

05:25.650 --> 05:27.220
Okay, new subject.

05:27.220 --> 05:28.650
Let's talk about presents.

05:28.650 --> 05:30.280
What did you get Amy?

05:30.280 --> 05:32.460
Oh, we're not exchanging gifts.

05:32.460 --> 05:35.170
Come on, Sheldon, you have to get her something.

05:35.170 --> 05:36.490
Why should I?

05:36.490 --> 05:38.490
She knows that I don't like Christmas,

05:38.490 --> 05:41.380
and yet, every year, she forces me to celebrate it.

05:41.380 --> 05:44.370
Not only am I going to this foolish dinner against my will.

05:44.370 --> 05:46.800
At the Christmas tree lot, there was mistletoe,

05:46.800 --> 05:49.240
and she kissed me under it in public.

05:49.240 --> 05:52.780
Like we were the stars of a Tijuana sex show.

05:53.880 --> 05:56.350
She's just excited about the holidays.

05:56.350 --> 06:00.360
Yes, and she's not taking my feelings into account at all.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.910
Maybe it's time I teach her a lesson.

06:03.150 --> 06:04.470
How?

06:05.810 --> 06:08.170
It'd have to be something heinous,

06:08.170 --> 06:11.840
something that makes her as miserable as she's making me.

06:12.630 --> 06:14.340
Oh, I've got it.

06:15.170 --> 06:17.810
This is good.

06:18.380 --> 06:19.300
What?

06:19.300 --> 06:22.130
I'm going to buy her a present.

06:24.060 --> 06:26.620
Yeah, you're gonna have to walk me through that.

06:26.620 --> 06:29.480
With gift-giving, there's an implied social contract.

06:29.480 --> 06:31.370
If I show up tonight with a present,

06:31.370 --> 06:32.900
and she doesn't have one for me,

06:32.900 --> 06:35.440
she'll feel terrible.

06:36.080 --> 06:38.030
Then you're both sad?

06:38.030 --> 06:40.080
Yes.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.230
Maybe she'll feel so guilty,

06:41.230 --> 06:44.320
she'll never make me celebrate the holidays again.

06:44.320 --> 06:48.430
So your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?

06:48.430 --> 06:49.900
That's right.

06:49.900 --> 06:53.170
So stay on my good side, or I'll get you a little something, too.

06:59.670 --> 07:01.540
Okay, here's the plan.

07:01.540 --> 07:03.380
I'm gonna put the food in the bag,

07:03.380 --> 07:06.810
and when he lands in the bag to eat it, we close it up.

07:06.810 --> 07:08.720
A Slim Jim?

07:09.500 --> 07:11.300
It's all I could find. It'll work.

07:11.300 --> 07:11.910
Sure.

07:11.910 --> 07:14.660
If the pigeon's stoned or a trucker.

07:16.050 --> 07:17.630
Okay, well, what's your plan?

07:17.630 --> 07:18.790
I told you my plan.

07:18.790 --> 07:20.770
Let's call Building Services and get help.

07:20.770 --> 07:23.790
And admit that we contaminated the clean room?

07:23.790 --> 07:26.660
No, admit that you contaminated the clean room.

07:26.660 --> 07:29.270
Why do you keep assuming it was me?

07:29.270 --> 07:31.280
Because you do this kind of thing all the time,

07:31.280 --> 07:33.120
and then you try to cover it up.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.190
Like when?

07:34.810 --> 07:37.310
What about when you flipped the Mars Rover,

07:37.310 --> 07:38.830
or lost Koothrappali's dog,

07:38.830 --> 07:41.490
or almost drove off with that baby?

07:42.040 --> 07:45.160
Again, it looked like my car, and the baby didn't even cry

07:45.160 --> 07:48.170
until his mother punched me with her keys.

07:48.550 --> 07:50.680
Fine, put the Slim Jim in the garbage bag.

07:50.680 --> 07:53.010
Well, what if you said it without sounding so condescending?

07:53.010 --> 07:54.830
I can try, but your plan has the words

07:54.830 --> 07:57.590
"Garbage bag" and "Slim Jim" in it!

07:58.770 --> 07:59.720
Hey, what's going on?

07:59.720 --> 08:01.310
Genius here wants to catch a bird

08:01.310 --> 08:03.720
with a garbage bag and a Slim Jim.

08:09.230 --> 08:11.600
Should have put it in the bag first.

08:16.750 --> 08:18.500
So, if you don't mind me asking,

08:18.500 --> 08:20.460
do you think you might start dating again?

08:20.460 --> 08:21.960
It's much too soon for that.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.440
Why? Do you know someone?

08:25.070 --> 08:26.950
No, but if things don't work out with me and Leonard,

08:26.950 --> 08:28.520
I'll give you a call.

08:28.520 --> 08:31.960
Wait. How much do you talk about Star Trek?

08:33.490 --> 08:37.290
Okay, let's get this Victorian party started.

08:37.290 --> 08:38.430
I've done some research

08:38.430 --> 08:40.900
about some traditional parlor games we can play.

08:40.900 --> 08:42.300
Like what?

08:42.300 --> 08:46.290
Well, there's a fun one called Ball of Wool.

08:47.440 --> 08:49.360
You take a ball of wool,

08:49.920 --> 08:52.170
and you put it right in the center of the table.

08:52.170 --> 08:54.370
Then people sit on opposite sides of the table

08:54.370 --> 08:56.750
and try to blow the wool off.

08:59.670 --> 09:02.640
Sorry. She's taken, too.

09:04.830 --> 09:06.400
You know what I think your problem is?

09:06.400 --> 09:07.370
You're jealous

09:07.370 --> 09:09.530
because you and I used to be best friends

09:09.530 --> 09:11.820
until Koothrappali came along.

09:11.820 --> 09:14.170
And you found somebody you could push around?

09:14.440 --> 09:16.570
- Stay out of this. - Okay.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.940
You know, maybe I'm best friends with Raj

09:19.940 --> 09:22.530
because he doesn't think he's smarter than me.

09:22.530 --> 09:24.800
- Actually... - I said, stay out of it!

09:25.050 --> 09:27.380
N-No. No, Raj, go ahead, say what you were gonna say.

09:27.380 --> 09:28.560
All I'm gonna say is

09:28.560 --> 09:30.690
you guys need to stop this right now.

09:30.690 --> 09:33.360
It-It's bad enough that my parents are fighting,

09:33.360 --> 09:35.340
now I have to hear the two of you?

09:35.340 --> 09:37.120
And who cares who's smarter?

09:37.120 --> 09:38.880
If it's Leonard or me or...

09:38.880 --> 09:41.600
you know, it's Christmas, let's say it's Howard.

09:44.130 --> 09:46.770
Well, if you're so smart, you get the bird out.

09:46.770 --> 09:48.280
No, you're the one who let him in.

09:48.280 --> 09:50.100
How do you know it wasn't Leonard?

09:50.100 --> 09:52.210
Come on.

09:55.880 --> 09:57.340
What about that sweater?

09:57.340 --> 09:59.080
No, it's not good enough.

09:59.080 --> 10:01.150
It has to be perfect.

10:01.150 --> 10:03.120
I think the nicest gifts I've got from Howie

10:03.120 --> 10:05.230
show how well he knows me.

10:06.090 --> 10:08.890
Let's see, what do I know about Amy?

10:08.890 --> 10:12.880
She loves medieval literature; Chaucer's her favorite.

10:12.880 --> 10:16.920
And her eyes sparkle when she watches old French movies.

10:17.250 --> 10:20.990
I enjoy how harp music causes her fingers to dance

10:20.990 --> 10:23.380
as if she's playing along.

10:23.380 --> 10:26.570
Wow, you really do love her.

10:27.570 --> 10:29.180
I do.

10:30.720 --> 10:31.690
Now, let's find the kind of gift

10:31.690 --> 10:34.880
that makes her feel small and worthless.

11:04.610 --> 11:06.170
You won!

11:07.640 --> 11:10.380
Certainly doesn't feel like it, does it?

11:12.140 --> 11:15.690
You know, my wife used to throw theme parties like this all the time.

11:15.690 --> 11:18.410
Oh, I guess that's where Raj gets it from.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.050
Well, he and his mother

11:20.050 --> 11:21.790
spent a lot of time together when he was young.

11:21.790 --> 11:23.750
I was always working.

11:23.750 --> 11:27.660
Hey, you know, Raj is dating a doctor who works a lot.

11:27.660 --> 11:29.800
Him and his mom have a type.

11:29.800 --> 11:33.360
You g... Y-You got to laugh at that, right?

11:34.820 --> 11:37.110
No? All right.

11:38.990 --> 11:42.130
All right, let me see if I've got this straight.

11:42.790 --> 11:44.820
A picture of you on my lap

11:44.820 --> 11:46.620
is a way to punish your girlfriend

11:46.620 --> 11:49.070
for making you celebrate Christmas?

11:49.380 --> 11:50.310
Correct.

11:50.310 --> 11:55.230
Santa thinks dating you may be punishment enough.

11:57.190 --> 11:59.280
There's an argument for that.

11:59.280 --> 12:01.300
But I want to make sure.

12:01.300 --> 12:02.370
Smile.

12:02.370 --> 12:04.170
Ho, ho, ho!

12:09.690 --> 12:12.060
Okay. On the count of three,

12:12.060 --> 12:14.110
I'll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne.

12:14.110 --> 12:16.410
Howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit.

12:16.410 --> 12:19.210
Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out.

12:19.210 --> 12:21.370
Are you sure a dummy like me can handle something

12:21.370 --> 12:24.010
as complicated as a blanket?

12:24.390 --> 12:25.860
Do you want the fire extinguisher?

12:25.860 --> 12:27.110
- Yeah, I do. - Great.

12:27.110 --> 12:27.980
Here you go.

12:28.320 --> 12:29.180
Okay.

12:32.680 --> 12:35.760
One, two, three.

12:39.130 --> 12:40.700
Uh, you have to take the pin out.

12:44.750 --> 12:47.680
You miss the blanket now, don't you?

12:50.020 --> 12:50.960
On three.

12:50.960 --> 12:53.470
One, two, three.

13:02.210 --> 13:04.450
What did you do?

13:04.450 --> 13:05.790
It was an accident.

13:05.790 --> 13:07.830
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.240
Relax, it wasn't your fault.

13:09.240 --> 13:10.940
Uh, maybe it's just stunned.

13:10.940 --> 13:13.270
Dude, I-it's not breathing.

13:13.270 --> 13:16.450
Oh, no. I killed it.

13:16.450 --> 13:18.580
Oh, not again.

13:19.360 --> 13:20.790
What do you mean, not again?

13:23.890 --> 13:25.290
When I was ten,

13:25.290 --> 13:27.430
I was playing in my backyard and...

13:29.420 --> 13:31.840
sat on a blue jay.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.330
I mean, I tried to bring it back to life with electricity,

13:36.330 --> 13:38.360
but it just...

13:39.060 --> 13:40.460
caught on fire.

13:43.430 --> 13:45.960
The worst part was it smelled delicious.

13:48.070 --> 13:49.730
Uh, guys, I found an article here

13:49.730 --> 13:52.100
that says you can do CPR on birds.

13:52.100 --> 13:53.630
Great! Do it!

13:53.630 --> 13:55.390
I'm not doing it. You killed him, you do it.

13:55.390 --> 13:56.900
- I'll do it. - No.

13:57.330 --> 13:58.830
I need to do it.

13:58.830 --> 14:00.580
This is on me.

14:04.690 --> 14:05.330
Okay.

14:05.970 --> 14:09.080
"Mouth over beak and light chest compressions."

14:09.080 --> 14:09.970
Don't blow too hard.

14:09.970 --> 14:12.530
If you pop him, I will vomit.

14:15.320 --> 14:16.380
Anything?

14:16.380 --> 14:18.770
I am tasting a lot of Slim Jim.

14:22.710 --> 14:24.840
Wait, wait, his wing moved!

14:24.840 --> 14:26.620
Oh, he blinked his eyes! He's alive!

14:26.620 --> 14:28.180
It's a Christmas miracle!

14:28.180 --> 14:31.500
I might argue a Hanukkah miracle, but I'll take it.

14:31.500 --> 14:34.190
Come on, little guy, let's get you outside. Get the curtain.

14:41.380 --> 14:44.720
Someone should really close that loading door.

14:50.680 --> 14:52.930
Well, that's that.

14:52.930 --> 14:54.470
The room's compromised.

14:54.470 --> 14:56.340
They'll have to change all the filters,

14:56.340 --> 14:59.100
probably shut it down for weeks.

14:59.430 --> 15:02.260
You were right. Go ahead, call Building Services.

15:02.260 --> 15:04.850
- Tell them it was my fault. - No, we're both to blame.

15:04.850 --> 15:06.720
You know, let me take the heat on this one.

15:06.720 --> 15:07.720
Yeah, just leave me out of it.

15:07.720 --> 15:09.210
You know if they come here and see crap everywhere,

15:09.210 --> 15:11.650
they're just gonna blame the Indian guy.

15:16.890 --> 15:19.020
Hey. I'm sorry, we're still here.

15:19.020 --> 15:20.210
Is everything okay?

15:20.210 --> 15:21.560
It's kind of boring.

15:21.560 --> 15:23.030
Although it did get exciting for a minute

15:23.030 --> 15:25.420
when Amy inhaled a wool ball.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.120
How much longer do you think you'll be?

15:28.120 --> 15:28.960
I don't know.

15:28.960 --> 15:30.490
There's still a bird in here.

15:30.490 --> 15:32.390
We are gonna get in a ton of trouble.

15:32.390 --> 15:33.610
Honey, it's Christmas Eve.

15:33.610 --> 15:34.650
Who even knows you're in there?

15:34.650 --> 15:36.800
No, our names are on the sign-in sheet.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.550
So erase them and walk out.

15:38.550 --> 15:40.470
I can't do that.

15:40.470 --> 15:41.410
Can't do what?

15:41.410 --> 15:44.370
She says take our names off the sign-in sheet and leave.

15:44.370 --> 15:47.030
- We can't do that. - Yeah.

15:49.040 --> 15:52.310
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way

15:52.310 --> 15:54.040
Oh, what fun it is to ride

15:54.040 --> 15:56.530
in a one-horse open sleigh, hey!

15:58.960 --> 16:01.580
Amy, that pudding was delicious.

16:01.580 --> 16:03.950
If you like raisins.

16:04.660 --> 16:06.680
Thank you. And it's figs.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.650
Oh, in that case, it was pretty good.

16:11.070 --> 16:13.470
You feeling okay? You hardly touched your goose.

16:13.470 --> 16:16.260
It smelled too much like blue jay.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.170
Can I help you clean up?

16:18.170 --> 16:20.030
Oh, you Heimliched a ball of wool out of me;

16:20.030 --> 16:21.270
you're good.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.260
Uh, what do you say we exchange gifts?

16:25.260 --> 16:26.690
Oh, Sheldon, we didn't bring any.

16:26.690 --> 16:28.220
I thought you hate giving gifts.

16:28.220 --> 16:29.110
Yeah, I do.

16:29.110 --> 16:32.680
Which is why I got Amy this.

16:32.680 --> 16:34.470
You got me something?

16:34.470 --> 16:35.890
Oh, not just something, no.

16:35.890 --> 16:38.640
It's from the heart, it's holiday-themed,

16:38.640 --> 16:42.970
and I swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it.

16:46.150 --> 16:48.680
Look at you on Santa's lap.

16:48.680 --> 16:50.030
That's so sweet.

16:50.030 --> 16:53.150
Of course it is. It's the perfect gift.

16:53.150 --> 16:54.820
H-How are you feeling right now?

16:54.820 --> 16:57.400
Guilty? Sad?

16:57.400 --> 16:59.220
Wishing you were Jewish?

17:00.820 --> 17:02.440
No, I love it.

17:02.440 --> 17:03.720
Oh, really?

17:03.720 --> 17:05.570
Well, how about now?

17:06.950 --> 17:11.230
Happy holidays to my dear Amy.

17:11.230 --> 17:13.530
I hope you treasure this

17:13.530 --> 17:17.010
as much as I treasure you.

17:18.280 --> 17:20.990
And you got me nothing.

17:21.590 --> 17:23.190
Christmas is ruined.

17:23.190 --> 17:25.850
Let's never speak of it again.

17:25.850 --> 17:28.310
Well, this was fun.

17:29.070 --> 17:30.380
Actually,

17:30.810 --> 17:33.190
I did get you something.

17:33.810 --> 17:35.580
But what about our agreement?

17:35.580 --> 17:38.540
Well, you got me something. Here.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.410
Cookies?

17:44.810 --> 17:47.610
They're your Meemaw's Christmas cookies.

17:47.610 --> 17:50.350
I called and got the recipe.

17:59.580 --> 18:02.030
They're perfect.

18:03.050 --> 18:05.170
It tastes like her hugs.

18:07.790 --> 18:10.480
Merry Christmas, Sheldon.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.310
I can't believe this.

18:13.310 --> 18:17.240
You're happy, I'm happy.

18:17.240 --> 18:19.690
Well, maybe a holiday that's all about giving isn't so...

18:19.690 --> 18:21.610
Get your hand out of that box!

18:26.390 --> 18:27.440
Okay.

18:27.440 --> 18:31.710
The next game is called Hot Boiled Beans.

18:33.010 --> 18:34.760
Of course it is.

18:35.630 --> 18:37.610
One person is sent out of the room

18:37.610 --> 18:40.280
while the others hide a small item.

18:40.280 --> 18:43.450
Then they invite the first person back by saying,

18:43.450 --> 18:45.470
"Hot boiled beans and bacon for supper,

18:45.470 --> 18:48.270
hurry up before it gets cold."

18:51.720 --> 18:54.250
If you people think this is better than Tom Hanks-giving,

18:54.250 --> 18:56.320
you're all crazy.
