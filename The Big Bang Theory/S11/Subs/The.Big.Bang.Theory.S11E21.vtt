WEBVTT

00:06.508 --> 00:07.509
What're you doing?

00:07.884 --> 00:09.386
Pigeon check for Sheldon.

00:11.096 --> 00:12.555
North side's all clear.

00:12.639 --> 00:14.391
Great. Let's look at some planets.

00:16.017 --> 00:18.186
Hey, why'd you lug your telescope
all the way over here?

00:18.269 --> 00:19.479
Leonard has one in our apartment.

00:19.562 --> 00:21.147
Yeah, I'm gonna
use Leonard's.

00:21.231 --> 00:24.067
Might as well hold my hand up like this
and squint.

00:26.945 --> 00:28.279
I don't know, it seemed pretty good.

00:28.363 --> 00:29.447
You know, once when the cable went out

00:29.531 --> 00:30.699
I watched an entire episode of

00:30.782 --> 00:32.951
<i>The Bachelor</i> on the TV
across the street.

00:34.160 --> 00:36.121
This one's more of a professional model.

00:36.204 --> 00:37.539
So was the girl he picked!

00:38.957 --> 00:43.294
This baby's got a 10-inch diameter
with F-10 ACF optics.

00:43.378 --> 00:46.881
And tonight,
Mercury is at its highest elongation.

00:47.590 --> 00:51.761
It makes far away things seem close,
and Mercury is a planet.

00:53.054 --> 00:57.392
I know Mercury is a planet.
But the other thing was helpful.

00:58.893 --> 01:01.896
Oh, look at that.
Neil Gaiman tweeted about my store.

01:01.980 --> 01:03.189
What did he say?

01:03.273 --> 01:06.025
"Next time you're in Pasadena,
check out The Comic Center.

01:06.109 --> 01:09.738
"Great vibe, old school,
the owner really knows his stuff."

01:09.821 --> 01:10.989
Isn't that amazing?

01:11.072 --> 01:12.949
Well, it's no <i>Sandman</i>

01:13.032 --> 01:15.952
but I guess we can't expect everything
he writes to be a masterpiece.

01:16.661 --> 01:18.163
When was he in your store?

01:18.246 --> 01:20.749
I have no idea.
I think I would remember that.

01:21.499 --> 01:24.878
Obviously vibranium
is the most powerful metal in comics.

01:25.378 --> 01:27.255
More powerful than adamantium?

01:27.338 --> 01:32.093
Mmm. He's right, Wolverine's claws,
Ultron's outer shell, need I go on?

01:32.177 --> 01:34.637
You don't need to,
but you probably will.

01:36.765 --> 01:38.558
What about Wonder Woman's bracelets?

01:38.641 --> 01:42.854
Good point. Strong as a metal
and fierce as a fashion choice.

01:44.439 --> 01:46.357
You know,
Thor's hammer is pretty powerful,

01:46.441 --> 01:49.027
and in the comics
it's made out of enchanted uru.

01:50.236 --> 01:52.530
Yeah. I think it's the enchantment
that's powerful

01:52.614 --> 01:55.158
and not the Uru, but thanks for playing.

01:58.661 --> 02:02.165
Oh, man! I can't believe Neil Gaiman
came in and we weren't even there.

02:02.248 --> 02:03.249
No.

02:30.610 --> 02:31.903
Can you see Mercury? Can you see it?

02:33.029 --> 02:34.322
One second.

02:34.948 --> 02:37.700
You know the
Greek version of Mercury, Hermes,

02:37.784 --> 02:41.454
was worshiped in Athens by the
carving of giant wooden phalluses.

02:42.121 --> 02:45.834
Please, Amy, get your mind
out of the ancient Athenian gutter.

02:47.418 --> 02:49.587
Got another follower, I'm blowing up.

02:51.172 --> 02:53.424
- Great, how many does that make?
- High double digits.

02:53.508 --> 02:55.718
- The nineties?
- Mid double digits.

02:57.512 --> 02:58.972
Hey, uh, Penny,
you wanna check this out?

02:59.055 --> 03:00.056
Yeah. Sure.

03:00.139 --> 03:01.558
All right. Just look through here

03:01.641 --> 03:03.351
and if you wanna take a picture
just push that button.

03:03.434 --> 03:06.896
Okay. Oh, what is that?

03:06.980 --> 03:08.982
Is it Mercury?
I'm really jonesing for Mercury.

03:10.817 --> 03:13.361
I think it's a little early
for Mercury to be visible yet.

03:14.070 --> 03:16.531
Playing hard to get.
I like that in a planet.

03:18.616 --> 03:20.410
No, there's something fuzzy.

03:20.743 --> 03:22.453
Is it your teen years?

03:24.497 --> 03:29.669
No. Yes. Shut up. Look, I...
No really, I think I see something.

03:29.752 --> 03:31.004
Well, it could just be your eyelash.

03:31.087 --> 03:32.338
It's not an eyelash.

03:32.422 --> 03:34.507
Okay, well, take a picture. Let's see.

03:34.591 --> 03:36.426
Okay. Here.

03:40.805 --> 03:41.806
Hmm.

03:42.098 --> 03:43.933
- I do see something.
- Told ya.

03:44.017 --> 03:47.937
- What is it?
- I don't know. Maybe it's a comet.

03:48.396 --> 03:49.898
That would be so cool.

03:49.981 --> 03:53.067
You guys wanna see a real star,
look over here.

03:53.151 --> 03:54.152
What?

03:54.235 --> 03:58.239
I just got retweeted by
Patton Oswalt's brother.

04:04.412 --> 04:06.289
So, this is really
where Neil Gaiman shops?

04:06.831 --> 04:10.627
Neil Gaiman, Nicholas Cage,
Natalie Portman, the list goes on.

04:11.502 --> 04:12.545
They all come here?

04:13.796 --> 04:15.048
Unless I'm lying.

04:24.641 --> 04:28.811
Who are all these people?
What... Wait is this a flash mob?

04:30.813 --> 04:32.148
Are they dancing?

04:33.524 --> 04:35.526
I don't know what
today's dancing looks like.

04:36.819 --> 04:40.365
Hey, guys. That tweet actually
got people to come in. Isn't that great?

04:40.657 --> 04:43.242
No. I like the way the store was before.

04:43.660 --> 04:45.453
You mean empty and sad?

04:47.163 --> 04:48.414
Yes, it was perfect.

04:49.874 --> 04:52.085
Like a funeral home
that sells Pokemon cards.

04:55.213 --> 04:58.049
What am I supposed to do now if
I wanna hang out and read a comic book?

04:58.591 --> 04:59.592
Go sit on the couch.

05:01.594 --> 05:03.346
A... Next to a stranger?

05:04.347 --> 05:06.808
I say, if I'm gonna sit,
read and ignore a woman,

05:06.891 --> 05:08.184
it's gonna be my fiancÃ©e.

05:09.769 --> 05:11.521
Why're you being such a baby
about the crowds?

05:11.604 --> 05:12.605
You go to Comic Con.

05:12.814 --> 05:15.984
You... I'm sorry. You're comparing
this place to Comic Con?

05:16.901 --> 05:18.444
What... Can I go to the bathroom here,

05:18.528 --> 05:20.405
next to a Wookiee
who got his zipper stuck in his fur?

05:22.031 --> 05:24.409
Wow, we go to Comic Con
for different reasons.

05:26.577 --> 05:28.079
You know... Just...

05:28.162 --> 05:31.499
Get me a copy of <i>Action Comics</i> #1,000,
and I'll be on my way.

05:31.749 --> 05:32.834
Sorry, all out.

05:33.501 --> 05:35.878
Now you just let people
come in and buy them?

05:37.005 --> 05:39.757
Oh, so I didn't realize
your soul was also for sale.

05:41.009 --> 05:43.970
Well, it wasn't. But make me an offer.

05:48.891 --> 05:50.435
- Who is that?
- Sheldon.

05:50.518 --> 05:51.811
- Who's he mad at?
- Neil Gaiman.

05:51.894 --> 05:52.895
- Who's that?
- Not us.

05:52.979 --> 05:53.980
Oh, great.

05:57.025 --> 05:58.026
- Guys.
- Hey.

05:58.109 --> 05:59.944
- Hi.
- So guess what.

06:00.278 --> 06:03.322
That indeed was a comet last night,

06:03.656 --> 06:05.450
and it turns out
no one's seen it before.

06:05.700 --> 06:07.035
- Wow!
- What? Really?

06:07.118 --> 06:09.912
Look at that,
I just discovered a comet. Oh!

06:10.079 --> 06:11.914
What do you mean, you discovered it?

06:12.206 --> 06:13.499
Well, I'm the one who saw it.

06:13.791 --> 06:17.628
In my telescope, that I positioned.
All you did was look into it.

06:17.712 --> 06:19.297
You both discovered it.

06:19.380 --> 06:21.632
You can put both your names
on the registration form.

06:21.716 --> 06:23.551
- Actually we can't.
- Why not?

06:23.634 --> 06:24.802
Because when I filled it out,

06:24.886 --> 06:27.764
it asked for name of discoverer
and I put Rajesh Koothrappali,

06:27.847 --> 06:32.018
because, because that's who I am
and that's what I did.

06:32.977 --> 06:33.978
Are you kidding me?

06:34.062 --> 06:36.564
Well, he is the one
who knew it was a comet.

06:36.647 --> 06:38.483
No he didn't,
he thought it was an eyelash.

06:39.275 --> 06:41.569
And you thought it was a fuzzy streak.

06:41.652 --> 06:43.404
I mean, do you even know
what a comet is?

06:43.488 --> 06:44.822
Yeah. The thing I saw first.

06:46.532 --> 06:49.202
I honestly don't think that
that qualifies as a discovery.

06:49.285 --> 06:50.411
But I took the picture.

06:50.495 --> 06:51.662
Because I told you to.

06:51.746 --> 06:54.540
Like, if a monkey took the picture,
did it discover the comet?

06:54.624 --> 06:56.000
Excuse me?

06:59.420 --> 07:00.797
He didn't mean monkey.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.465
Get the hell out of my apartment!

07:02.548 --> 07:03.800
She didn't mean that...

07:03.883 --> 07:05.218
Actually, I think she did,
you should go.

07:09.764 --> 07:11.641
- You look great.
- Thanks.

07:11.724 --> 07:14.393
Would you believe this is actually
a dress from before I was pregnant?

07:14.477 --> 07:17.772
Well, it's not a competition
but I wore this suit to my Bar Mitzvah.

07:20.191 --> 07:22.151
Where's Stuart? I told him
we had a 6:30 reservation.

07:22.735 --> 07:23.986
I don't know. I'll call him.

07:26.781 --> 07:28.741
Comic Center,
where the real superhero is you.

07:30.409 --> 07:32.453
Stuart, you're supposed
to be babysitting.

07:32.537 --> 07:36.791
Oh, shoot! That was tonight.
I forgot, the store's been really busy.

07:36.874 --> 07:38.835
Well, when can you get here?

07:38.918 --> 07:41.003
Um, I don't think I can. Listen to this.

07:41.087 --> 07:43.339
I was ringing up a customer
and I heard someone say,

07:43.422 --> 07:45.758
"Hey, there's a line,"
and I looked, and there was.

07:47.718 --> 07:49.595
Come on. You can't do this to us.

07:49.679 --> 07:52.765
I am really sorry,
I will make it up to you.

07:52.849 --> 07:55.601
But it won't be with
a Val Kilmer Batman figurine

07:55.685 --> 07:57.728
because some
sucker's buying that right now.

07:58.980 --> 08:00.356
Not you, this is great.

08:03.109 --> 08:04.694
He says he has to work.

08:04.777 --> 08:07.363
Oh, it's okay, we can have
date night another night.

08:07.446 --> 08:08.990
But you got all dressed up.

08:09.073 --> 08:12.034
We were supposed to
have dinner and romance.

08:12.118 --> 08:14.120
We'll just have to divide and conquer.

08:14.203 --> 08:17.957
I'll go to dinner and you can stay home
with the internet and have romance.

08:21.544 --> 08:22.962
Okay, look, I googled it.

08:23.045 --> 08:24.881
I took the picture,
so it's my discovery.

08:25.256 --> 08:26.465
He stole my comet.

08:26.674 --> 08:29.010
I know. But on the other hand,
do you really care?

08:29.302 --> 08:31.721
Yes, I care.
This happens to me all the time.

08:31.804 --> 08:34.390
People take one look at me and assume
I don't know what I'm talking about.

08:34.640 --> 08:35.892
Mmm, I'm sure that's not true.

08:36.100 --> 08:38.477
I'm sorry, are you saying
I don't know what I'm talking about?

08:40.146 --> 08:42.440
No, I'm not saying anything ever again.

08:44.025 --> 08:45.109
Look, I'm serious.

08:45.193 --> 08:46.944
The other day at work,
I had this great idea.

08:47.028 --> 08:48.070
But no one was listening to me,

08:48.154 --> 08:49.822
and then five minutes later
Paul said the same thing

08:49.906 --> 08:51.324
and they practically
carried him around the room.

08:51.407 --> 08:52.825
Oh, well, what was it?

08:52.909 --> 08:55.745
Well, CPK for lunch
but that's just one example.

08:56.871 --> 08:58.998
It also happens with all the doctors
I have to deal with,

08:59.081 --> 09:00.833
you know, they're so condescending.

09:00.917 --> 09:03.211
I'm so sick of letting this stuff slide.
I found that comet.

09:03.294 --> 09:04.712
Why shall I let Raj say he found it?

09:05.171 --> 09:08.424
I know you're right but he is our friend
and this could be good for his career.

09:08.716 --> 09:11.469
Wait. So you agree with me
but he still gets his way?

09:11.761 --> 09:13.137
There you go. Everybody wins.

09:13.930 --> 09:17.266
My God, you're such a people pleaser.
You can't stand making anyone angry.

09:17.642 --> 09:19.310
Why would I want to make anyone angry?

09:19.393 --> 09:21.187
'Cause it would mean
you were on my side.

09:21.270 --> 09:22.855
Oh, I am on your side.

09:22.939 --> 09:26.359
Hey, let's not forget
who you're really mad at here.

09:26.442 --> 09:29.946
Raj. Oh and Paul. Paul sucks, right?

09:31.864 --> 09:33.324
But don't tell him I said that.

09:36.369 --> 09:38.913
Hey, Howard. Did you see the...

09:46.671 --> 09:47.672
I'm over here, Sheldon.

09:49.674 --> 09:53.344
Oh! That was a close one.
I almost went home with that guy.

09:55.137 --> 09:57.139
You doing okay? Do we need to go?

09:57.306 --> 09:58.933
No, I'm fine.

09:59.016 --> 10:01.852
I admit, all these people
did take me by surprise at first.

10:01.936 --> 10:04.563
But I've learnt that
I can accept change.

10:05.481 --> 10:06.524
Since when?

10:07.984 --> 10:10.278
I managed it when
Amy switched her shampoo

10:10.361 --> 10:12.029
from Prell to Prell for oily hair.

10:13.072 --> 10:16.242
Although, I do miss the way her head
used to slide off the pillow.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.917
- May I help you?
- Who are you?

10:25.209 --> 10:27.044
Oh, I'm Denise.
The new assistant manager.

10:28.546 --> 10:29.588
Nope.

10:36.929 --> 10:38.389
Can you believe it?

10:38.472 --> 10:41.892
In the past decade I have spent
thousands of dollars in that store.

10:41.976 --> 10:43.352
And this is the thanks I get.

10:43.686 --> 10:46.314
You're right, I mean,
he could at least get you a mug.

10:48.441 --> 10:51.110
He gave me a mug.
What do you think I'm drinking out of?

10:52.028 --> 10:54.071
Oh, do you even pay attention?

10:54.155 --> 10:55.614
Honestly, less and less.

10:58.242 --> 11:00.911
Amy, the comic book store is like

11:00.995 --> 11:03.914
my version of the country
in <i>Black Panther.</i>

11:04.373 --> 11:07.877
Okay, I'm afraid this is gonna get
really offensive to certain groups.

11:08.669 --> 11:09.712
But go on.

11:11.339 --> 11:14.175
The nation of Wakanda was a hidden gem

11:14.258 --> 11:16.052
and they wanted to keep it that way

11:16.135 --> 11:18.804
because they knew
if they opened it up to the world,

11:18.888 --> 11:21.223
everything that was special about it
would get ruined.

11:22.808 --> 11:23.934
- Are you done?
- Yes.

11:24.060 --> 11:29.231
Okay! That both
made sense and wasn't offensive.

11:30.983 --> 11:33.361
And to make things worse,
Stuart hired some woman.

11:33.444 --> 11:34.570
There we go.

11:34.653 --> 11:36.197
Yep. No.

11:36.572 --> 11:40.368
I'm not annoyed that she's a woman.
I'm annoyed and she's a woman.

11:40.826 --> 11:43.871
No, I get that.
I'm annoyed and I'm a woman.

11:46.082 --> 11:48.751
It's just, Stuart knows
my likes and dislikes

11:48.834 --> 11:50.711
and I can count on his discretion

11:50.795 --> 11:54.715
if I pick up the occasional back issue
of Superman's pal, Jimmy Olsen.

11:57.176 --> 11:58.427
Which I don't.

11:59.637 --> 12:02.264
Well, don't think of her as a stranger.

12:02.640 --> 12:06.519
Just think of her as a friend
you haven't berated,

12:06.602 --> 12:08.354
lectured or condescended to yet.

12:10.189 --> 12:13.401
I hadn't thought of it that way.
Thank you.

12:13.484 --> 12:14.485
You're welcome.

12:14.568 --> 12:17.363
I mean, you're wise
and you smell like books.

12:20.533 --> 12:22.076
You really are the whole package.

12:26.330 --> 12:27.581
Raj, just help me out.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.625
Penny's pretty mad
about this comet thing.

12:29.708 --> 12:33.295
Well, I'm sorry she's upset.
But she didn't discover it.

12:33.379 --> 12:36.757
Come on. You know she was a part of it.
Just add her name to the registration.

12:36.841 --> 12:39.218
But I already told everyone at work
that I did it.

12:39.301 --> 12:41.762
My boss was so excited
he started calling me Captain Comet,

12:43.180 --> 12:45.641
which is better than
his last nickname for me, Doctor Donuts,

12:46.851 --> 12:50.729
because one time I had two donuts.
And two times I had three donuts.

12:53.649 --> 12:55.734
I guess you're just gonna
have to swallow your pride.

12:55.818 --> 12:57.736
I... I can't do that.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.656
Sure you can.
Just pretend it's two or three donuts.

13:01.782 --> 13:05.202
You don't understand, Leonard,
I need this.

13:05.286 --> 13:08.247
My last big discovery was
if you press your upper lip hard enough,

13:08.330 --> 13:09.707
you can block a sneeze.

13:12.751 --> 13:14.003
I told you that.

13:15.588 --> 13:18.924
This is all my fault.
I brought this upon myself.

13:20.176 --> 13:23.012
I'm a bad scientist.
I'm a selfish person.

13:23.095 --> 13:26.056
No, no, don't get upset.
You're not a bad person.

13:26.140 --> 13:30.519
Just let me talk to Penny.
I'm sure I can make her understand.

13:30.603 --> 13:32.897
Thank you.
You're a good friend, Leonard.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.691
I'm glad you think so,
'cause I may be living here soon.

13:45.159 --> 13:47.286
Just look at her, over there.

13:47.369 --> 13:49.872
She just started and
she gets to put up "Staff Picks."

13:49.955 --> 13:53.083
I've been coming here over ten years,
I still can't put up "Sheldon Dislikes."

13:54.335 --> 13:57.963
I talked to her yesterday,
she really seems to know her stuff.

13:59.340 --> 14:00.799
Challenge accepted.

14:01.717 --> 14:03.719
That is not what that was.

14:05.930 --> 14:09.475
Excuse me, I was wondering
if you could recommend something.

14:09.558 --> 14:11.435
Oh, sure.
You wanna tell me what you like?

14:11.769 --> 14:12.853
I would not.

14:18.484 --> 14:20.569
All right, well you're wearing
a Green Lantern shirt

14:20.653 --> 14:22.363
so I'm guessing you're a DC fan,

14:22.446 --> 14:23.948
although that's from the Alan Scott era

14:24.031 --> 14:26.033
so you're probably not super
into the current run.

14:26.116 --> 14:28.327
How would you
feel about an alternate history

14:28.410 --> 14:31.038
where World War One was fought
with dragons and magic?

14:31.830 --> 14:34.708
That's what I wanted the theme
of my tenth birthday party to be.

14:35.876 --> 14:39.880
Here. Check this out,
it's by Kurt Busiek.

14:40.214 --> 14:42.174
You know, if you're interested
in alternate histories,

14:42.341 --> 14:44.343
Neil Gaiman wrote one called <i>1 602.</i>

14:45.970 --> 14:47.429
I'm sorry,
we're in the middle of something here.

14:49.640 --> 14:50.724
It is pretty good, actually.

14:50.849 --> 14:54.853
He takes the Marvel superheroes and
he puts them into Elizabethan England.

14:55.187 --> 14:58.315
Let me guess, everyone thinks
the X-Men are the witches?

14:59.775 --> 15:00.776
Yeah.

15:04.446 --> 15:06.156
Why don't you take this home,
and if you don't like it,

15:06.532 --> 15:08.075
return it,
and I'll give you your money back.

15:08.367 --> 15:09.368
Just don't tell Stuart.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.328
Stuart who?

15:15.499 --> 15:16.792
Hey, where have you been?

15:17.293 --> 15:19.336
I went to yell at Raj.

15:19.712 --> 15:21.797
And? Is he gonna give me back my comet?

15:22.756 --> 15:23.757
Interesting thing.

15:24.258 --> 15:25.384
Did you cave?

15:25.467 --> 15:28.137
Maybe I did, or... Maybe I did.

15:30.639 --> 15:32.766
But I did realize something.

15:32.850 --> 15:35.561
I don't need
to fight your battles.

15:35.644 --> 15:38.606
You, you are a strong
and independent woman,

15:38.689 --> 15:40.608
you have your own voice.

15:40.691 --> 15:42.318
And to quote another strong woman,

15:42.401 --> 15:44.194
Katy Perry,
"It's time to hear you roar."

15:46.530 --> 15:48.449
Did you just think of that
on your way home?

15:48.532 --> 15:50.284
What do you want from me?
The song was on in the car.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.996
But it doesn't mean it's not true.

15:54.788 --> 15:57.833
Well, you make a good point.
I'm gonna go talk to Raj myself.

15:59.752 --> 16:02.588
I know I don't say it enough,
but you go, girl.

16:04.423 --> 16:05.466
That was enough.

16:09.470 --> 16:10.679
What's all this?

16:10.763 --> 16:14.141
Well, we missed our date night
and Stuart's working again.

16:14.224 --> 16:16.769
So, I thought we could have
a date night here at home.

16:17.186 --> 16:18.729
Why, that's so sweet.

16:18.812 --> 16:22.483
Oh, so, is that really
what you're wearing to our date night?

16:24.860 --> 16:27.404
Well, Stuart's not here
and the kids are sleeping.

16:27.488 --> 16:28.656
I can wear nothing.

16:29.406 --> 16:32.951
You might wanna hold off on that.
We're starting with soup.

16:35.454 --> 16:36.497
Hey!

16:36.580 --> 16:38.457
Wha... I thought you were
working late again.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.542
I was but Denise has got it covered.

16:41.043 --> 16:43.087
Oh, the funniest thing happened today.

16:43.170 --> 16:47.633
You know, the receipt tape
in the cash register, it ran out.

16:47.716 --> 16:49.843
I didn't even know
it could do that.

16:52.262 --> 16:54.056
You know,
we were just sitting down to dinner.

16:54.139 --> 16:56.058
Oh! Perfect timing. I'll go wash up.

16:58.394 --> 16:59.520
There goes date night.

16:59.603 --> 17:02.398
Are you kidding? Stuart's here,
get your purse, we're going out.

17:02.481 --> 17:03.982
What about the dinner you made?

17:04.441 --> 17:06.110
Right. Well, hey, Stuart!

17:06.193 --> 17:08.195
That can of soup sittin' by the stove,
that's for you.

17:09.321 --> 17:11.532
You made canned soup for date night?

17:11.615 --> 17:13.075
And you wore sweat pants. Let's go.

17:16.578 --> 17:20.290
Oh, and it turns out
Denise is also really excited

17:20.374 --> 17:21.792
for Dan Slott's run on Iron Man

17:21.875 --> 17:24.336
because he was her
favorite Spider-Man writer too.

17:24.420 --> 17:25.587
How about that?

17:27.047 --> 17:31.135
Oh, and guess who goes to
art school right here in Pasadena?

17:31.510 --> 17:33.595
Hmm, I don't know. Denise?

17:36.890 --> 17:40.936
You're a good guesser, Amy.
Not as good as Denise though.

17:41.019 --> 17:42.980
She thought
I would like this comic, <i>Arrowsmith,</i>

17:43.063 --> 17:44.231
and she was right.

17:45.190 --> 17:47.943
Well, was the store crowded?
I bet it was, I know you hate that.

17:48.026 --> 17:50.529
Yeah, It was.
But if it weren't for the crowds

17:50.612 --> 17:53.574
Stuart never would have hired Denise,
and she's the best.

17:59.496 --> 18:01.999
- You must be Denise.
- Oh, yeah. How can I help you?

18:02.082 --> 18:03.876
I'm Amy, Sheldon's fiancÃ©e.

18:04.168 --> 18:05.878
Oh. I gotta be honest,

18:05.961 --> 18:07.713
I wasn't a hundred percent sure
you were real.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.217
Oh, I am.

18:12.301 --> 18:13.635
And I heard you and Sheldon had

18:13.719 --> 18:15.262
a great time today
talking about comic books.

18:15.345 --> 18:16.346
We did.

18:16.430 --> 18:20.434
Great, here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna teach me how to do that.

18:20.809 --> 18:23.353
- Do what?
- Pretend to like comic books.

18:23.437 --> 18:25.856
Oh, no. I actually like comic books.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.983
All right, let's not
get hung up on semantics,

18:28.066 --> 18:29.401
it's late, we got a lot of work to do.

18:39.953 --> 18:40.954
I'm sorry.

18:42.414 --> 18:43.582
I haven't even said anything yet.

18:43.665 --> 18:45.834
I know but I heard
your footsteps coming up the stairs

18:45.918 --> 18:47.211
and they sounded angry.

18:48.504 --> 18:50.130
They are angry. I'm mad at you.

18:50.214 --> 18:52.299
And you have every right to be.

18:52.382 --> 18:54.176
Okay. I was... I was being a jerk.

18:54.676 --> 18:58.180
We did this together
and I hogged all of the credit.

18:58.639 --> 19:01.099
And after you've been
such a good friend to me over the years.

19:01.183 --> 19:03.894
Like, I wouldn't even be able to
talk to women if it wasn't for you.

19:03.977 --> 19:07.648
So... so, I'm... I'm gonna make sure
that your name is on the comet.

19:08.232 --> 19:09.566
Thank you.

19:09.650 --> 19:13.237
Even if it's
professionally embarrassing, you know.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.739
Or maybe put me on thin ice at work.

19:16.907 --> 19:22.287
I may lose my funding.
Still, uh, still wanna make this right.

19:22.371 --> 19:23.372
Good. Bye.

19:27.668 --> 19:29.294
That worked way better with Leonard.

19:39.763 --> 19:41.390
- Hello.
- Hi.

19:43.183 --> 19:44.768
Why are you reading a comic book?

19:45.686 --> 19:47.354
Denise recommended it to me.

19:48.146 --> 19:49.565
It's the <i>Rebirth Omnibus.</i>

19:49.648 --> 19:52.985
She thought it would be a good
entry point for me into the DC universe.

19:53.068 --> 19:54.486
And I have to say,
I really do like how...

19:54.570 --> 19:57.197
You know, Amy... Amy, I've talked
a lot about comic books lately.

19:57.281 --> 19:58.615
Can we talk about something else?

20:30.898 --> 20:31.899
English - SDH
