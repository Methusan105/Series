WEBVTT

00:05.048 --> 00:06.216
Why are you wearing a Band-Aid?

00:06.549 --> 00:07.592
Halley bit me.

00:07.884 --> 00:09.886
You got beaten up by a girl.

00:11.763 --> 00:12.764
Hey, that's sexist.

00:13.014 --> 00:14.015
You're right.

00:14.099 --> 00:16.059
You got beaten up by a baby.

00:18.561 --> 00:19.646
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:20.146 --> 00:21.147
Whatcha got there?

00:21.272 --> 00:23.191
I grabbed a sandwich
from the food truck out front.

00:23.483 --> 00:27.987
Hold on, tonight is Friday
and I believe you know what that means.

00:28.321 --> 00:31.032
That my fun, young life
took a drastic turn somewhere.

00:32.617 --> 00:34.285
- No.
- But, yeah.

00:36.121 --> 00:38.123
No, that means it's Chinese food night.

00:38.540 --> 00:40.375
Yeah, and you have Chinese food,
so eat it.

00:41.084 --> 00:42.877
But, I can smell your pastrami.

00:43.211 --> 00:45.547
And we can all hear your complaining,
so, no one's happy.

00:47.006 --> 00:48.049
It does smell good.

00:48.258 --> 00:49.467
It is, I had one the other day.

00:49.884 --> 00:51.052
What is happening?

00:51.553 --> 00:53.555
Everybody's supposed to be
eating Chinese food.

00:53.805 --> 00:56.725
Well, actually, I believe the Chinese
may have invented the sandwich.

00:56.975 --> 01:00.270
Their dish "rou jia mo" literally means
"meat between bread."

01:00.562 --> 01:03.690
So, looks like all of us, including
Penny, are eating Chinese food.

01:03.940 --> 01:05.984
Except for you Sheldon,
you're eating crow.

01:08.445 --> 01:10.780
I'm sorry, I think you're forgetting
that the sandwich

01:10.864 --> 01:14.325
was invented by John Montagu,
the Earl of Sandwich.

01:15.034 --> 01:17.787
Oh! The truck's called
Pearl of Sandwich. Now, I get it. Mmm.

01:19.706 --> 01:22.333
All right, that smells too good.
I gotta get one of those.

01:23.001 --> 01:26.045
And, I think you're forgetting that
there are written documents

01:26.129 --> 01:30.049
of meat between bread being eaten
in China during the Tang Dynasty.

01:30.550 --> 01:33.011
You know what, I'll go with you.
And then, maybe we just go home.

01:34.888 --> 01:37.140
I think you're defining bread
very loosely.

01:37.265 --> 01:38.933
If we go down that road,
where does it end?

01:39.309 --> 01:42.187
I would say when we go to bed,
but you talk in your sleep.

01:43.229 --> 01:44.898
I don't want to get into this
with you right now.

01:44.981 --> 01:46.608
We'll talk about this when I'm asleep.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.279
I don't wanna talk about it
when you're asleep.

01:51.488 --> 01:52.864
How come we can't talk about it now?

01:52.989 --> 01:54.282
Because I'm eating now.

01:55.492 --> 01:56.785
Fine, how's your Moo shu?

01:57.035 --> 01:58.203
You know what, it's great.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.580
What? Look at that.

02:01.623 --> 02:02.665
Hmm.

02:02.999 --> 02:05.460
Maybe the Chinese did invent
the sandwich.

02:07.128 --> 02:08.379
I guess you were right.

02:10.590 --> 02:12.091
Too bad no one's around to hear it.

02:41.496 --> 02:43.498
I can smell that food truck
from up here.

02:44.916 --> 02:47.252
Just close the window
if you don't like the smell.

02:47.669 --> 02:50.922
Of course, I like the smell,
it's salt and fat.

02:52.382 --> 02:53.925
My brain may be evolved

02:54.008 --> 02:55.802
but my tongue still wants to
pick up a club

02:55.885 --> 02:57.512
and drag that truck back to my cave.

02:59.138 --> 03:02.517
So there's something you like
but it's also driving you crazy.

03:03.518 --> 03:04.811
Been there, doing it now.

03:06.604 --> 03:08.481
No, it's a distraction.

03:08.565 --> 03:10.483
Now, how can I focus on my work
when all I can think about

03:10.608 --> 03:12.026
is how much I want that sandwich?

03:12.402 --> 03:13.444
So, go get one.

03:13.695 --> 03:16.197
I can't just give into every urge
I have when I have it.

03:16.322 --> 03:18.157
That's why I have a rigid schedule.

03:18.575 --> 03:21.244
It's bad enough I had to give into
my urge to create a rigid schedule.

03:22.620 --> 03:26.749
You know, why don't I just go down
to the food truck and ask them to move?

03:27.750 --> 03:29.502
- Why are you taking cash?
- No reason.

03:34.632 --> 03:39.137
Ah! This is the life.
What could be better than this?

03:39.971 --> 03:42.181
If you weren't wearing
one of my swimsuits.

03:43.892 --> 03:45.143
I'll give it back.

03:45.226 --> 03:46.895
Huh. You know the rule.

03:46.978 --> 03:49.898
Once it touches heinie,
it's no longer miney.

03:52.275 --> 03:55.486
You're such a prude. Do you know all the
things this water is touching right now?

03:55.737 --> 03:57.322
Well, I'm relaxed enough.

04:00.950 --> 04:02.577
Hey, Howard, look.

04:03.620 --> 04:04.621
What's that?

04:05.496 --> 04:06.539
Huh.

04:07.248 --> 04:09.292
Looks like someone's drone.

04:10.209 --> 04:12.253
Oh, no, do you it was spying on us
in the hot tub?

04:12.378 --> 04:14.756
'Cause I'm only 40% of the way
to my beach-bod.

04:16.132 --> 04:19.344
One of the propellers is broken,
it must've crashed.

04:19.594 --> 04:21.554
Oh. Do you think you could fix it?

04:21.804 --> 04:24.515
Maybe. Should we try
and track down the owner first?

04:25.141 --> 04:26.809
Yeah. That's probably a good idea.

04:27.727 --> 04:28.937
Anyone lose a drone?

04:31.731 --> 04:32.732
Looks like it's ours.

04:33.066 --> 04:34.359
Yay, we got a drone!

04:34.442 --> 04:37.153
- Shh!
- Oh! Yay, we got a drone.

04:43.284 --> 04:44.869
The pastrami truck moved.

04:47.288 --> 04:49.582
That is the danger
of a restaurant on wheels.

04:51.501 --> 04:54.003
No, apparently someone complained
to the tenants association.

04:54.087 --> 04:55.713
They're not allowed to park
on our street anymore.

04:56.339 --> 04:59.050
Who would complain about something
that everyone loves? Oh.

05:00.969 --> 05:03.721
Did you complain to the tenants
association about the food truck?

05:03.888 --> 05:05.556
- Yes.
- Wha...

05:07.016 --> 05:09.018
They actually took you seriously?

05:09.686 --> 05:12.188
Oh, the tenants association
takes every complaint seriously.

05:12.480 --> 05:16.901
Great, because I'm about to send them
an email complaining about you.

05:19.737 --> 05:21.030
Excuse me.

05:26.327 --> 05:27.453
Wow.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.082
Someone should have spell-checked.

05:32.917 --> 05:35.628
- What is going on here?
- You're the tenants association?

05:35.920 --> 05:37.839
You should see
the look on your face.

05:39.757 --> 05:42.760
And you might want to tell your wife
that there's no "Y" in pastrami.

05:47.724 --> 05:49.350
Okay, that oughta do it,

05:49.559 --> 05:53.855
I've replaced the propeller and
reattached the gimbal controller unit.

05:54.188 --> 05:56.774
Dude, you're like
<i>Grey's Anatomy</i> for robots.

05:58.651 --> 06:00.278
Also, why isn't that a show?

06:01.571 --> 06:05.450
I just need to see if I can re-sync
the controls to this old remote.

06:05.700 --> 06:06.701
We should name it.

06:07.035 --> 06:09.203
What? The drone
or your stupid robot show?

06:11.080 --> 06:15.168
The drone. The show's already
got a name, <i>General Bot-spital.</i>

06:18.004 --> 06:19.380
I got it working!

06:21.215 --> 06:22.341
Oh! Oh!

06:22.425 --> 06:23.718
Let's play William Tell.

06:23.843 --> 06:25.303
I'll put this bowl on my head,

06:25.470 --> 06:27.638
see if you can knock it off
without hitting me.

06:29.766 --> 06:31.142
You read my mind.

06:32.268 --> 06:33.436
What are you doing?

06:34.062 --> 06:37.065
Either breaking a bowl
or breaking Raj's head.

06:38.357 --> 06:40.401
Be careful, they don't make
that bowl anymore.

06:48.117 --> 06:49.285
It's a nice one.

06:49.452 --> 06:52.455
Yeah, we found it in the yard
and fixed it up.

06:52.789 --> 06:54.874
Aren't you worried there's some kid
out there missing his drone?

06:55.374 --> 06:58.002
Oh, please, Bernadette,
this is not a children's toy, okay?

06:58.086 --> 06:59.962
This thing's got a HD camera on it.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.048
Okay, then aren't you worried
there's some rich Peeping Tom

07:02.131 --> 07:03.424
out there missing his drone?

07:04.967 --> 07:09.555
We asked around and no one claimed it.
Ha. I think we've done all we can do.

07:11.432 --> 07:12.809
Did you check the video card?

07:12.934 --> 07:14.352
Maybe you could see
where it started off from.

07:15.728 --> 07:17.021
What a great idea, honey.

07:20.274 --> 07:21.317
So, let me get this straight,

07:21.484 --> 07:23.694
you are the president
of the tenants association?

07:24.028 --> 07:26.697
President, only member
and harshest critic.

07:28.825 --> 07:32.662
I once gave myself an official reprimand
for conducting a meeting in the shower.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.833
The steam warped my gavel.

07:37.875 --> 07:40.670
Okay, so, when I got a fine for leaving
my clothes in the dryer too long,

07:40.753 --> 07:41.754
that was from you?

07:41.963 --> 07:45.550
$14.99, the exact price of a new gavel.

07:47.510 --> 07:51.013
And the noise complaint we got
for singing you "Happy Birthday?"

07:52.014 --> 07:54.142
As a friend, I was touched.

07:54.433 --> 07:55.810
As a representative of the building,

07:55.893 --> 07:57.728
I thought that you should pick a key
and stick with it.

08:00.481 --> 08:01.482
Hi.

08:01.566 --> 08:03.860
Do you know he's
the entire tenants association?

08:04.193 --> 08:06.154
No, but I'm not surprised.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.948
He's also the pope of a planet
he invented in hyperspace.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.201
Why didn't you tell me?

08:12.410 --> 08:15.246
I wanted to make that sure
you loved the man, not the office.

08:16.622 --> 08:18.875
You can't just
declare yourself president.

08:19.167 --> 08:21.169
I didn't. I called a meeting,

08:21.252 --> 08:22.837
I was the only one to attend,

08:22.962 --> 08:23.963
I nominated myself

08:24.046 --> 08:26.757
and after a pretty moving speech,
I voted myself in.

08:29.010 --> 08:31.679
Well, if you can vote yourself in,
then we can vote you out.

08:31.762 --> 08:33.848
- Yeah.
- Fine make a motion at the next meeting.

08:33.931 --> 08:34.932
When is that?

08:35.016 --> 08:36.267
It's the first Saturday
of every month.

08:36.475 --> 08:37.977
Unless there's an emergency meeting.

08:38.269 --> 08:39.478
Then we call an emergency meeting.

08:39.729 --> 08:42.064
You don't really have to,
this is the first Saturday of the month.

08:43.608 --> 08:45.193
Okay, fine, then, we vote you out.

08:45.401 --> 08:47.069
Hold on, hold on,

08:47.236 --> 08:50.406
first, we have to read the minutes
from last month's meeting.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.576
Amy, would you do the honors?

08:53.868 --> 08:55.036
Why not?

08:55.703 --> 08:59.248
"Saturday, March third,
7:05, meeting called to order.

08:59.498 --> 09:02.627
"7:06, president gets shampoo in eye."

09:02.835 --> 09:03.878
Mmm-hmm.

09:04.670 --> 09:06.172
"7:07, meeting adjourned."

09:06.964 --> 09:08.341
Okay, can we vote you out now?

09:08.424 --> 09:11.135
Ah! Very well. New business.

09:13.262 --> 09:15.723
I move for a vote of no confidence
in the president.

09:15.932 --> 09:17.558
- Yeah.
- Two to one, you lose.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.185
Not so fast.

09:19.352 --> 09:22.396
I believe we have one tenant here
who has not made her voice heard.

09:25.650 --> 09:26.776
Oh.

09:28.194 --> 09:30.071
We're waiting, fiancée.

09:31.697 --> 09:33.741
Yeah, we're waiting, best friend.

09:35.284 --> 09:36.285
Yeah, we're waiting,

09:36.702 --> 09:38.704
neighbor who needed a battery

09:38.788 --> 09:41.249
and totally got one from me,
no strings attached.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.419
I don't wanna be in the middle of this.

09:45.795 --> 09:48.256
No matter which way I vote,
I'm either a bad friend,

09:48.381 --> 09:51.801
a bad fiancée or
an ungrateful recipient of a battery.

09:53.344 --> 09:55.763
Next time I have a meeting
in the shower, you're welcome to attend.

09:55.972 --> 09:57.807
Sheldon, Sheldon for president,
I pick Sheldon.

10:05.064 --> 10:07.149
Can't believe my best friend
sided with Sheldon.

10:07.275 --> 10:08.818
Can't believe my best friend is Sheldon.

10:11.570 --> 10:14.615
Ugh. I should've taken that gavel
and shoved it right down his throat.

10:15.199 --> 10:17.326
Ugh. I would've gone the other way
but it would've gotten to this throat.

10:19.537 --> 10:20.538
What?

10:20.621 --> 10:23.082
Don't be mad at me,
I mean, I can't vote against him.

10:23.207 --> 10:24.583
What? Even when he's being crazy?

10:24.792 --> 10:26.252
What other times are there?

10:27.628 --> 10:29.171
So you'll just let him
get away with anything?

10:29.338 --> 10:30.548
Well, not anything,

10:30.965 --> 10:34.176
but honestly, pastrami sandwich
is not the hill I want to die on.

10:35.386 --> 10:37.638
It's not about the sandwich,
it's about the principle.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.974
Yeah, principle.
And a little bit sandwich.

10:40.057 --> 10:41.058
Yeah.

10:41.559 --> 10:43.853
Look, there are a bunch of other
tenants in this building,

10:44.061 --> 10:46.022
all you need is
for one of them to vote your way,

10:46.230 --> 10:48.524
and then Sheldon's out
and I didn't betray him.

10:48.858 --> 10:50.234
Hey, you know
that's actually a good plan.

10:50.443 --> 10:53.070
That you came up with all by yourself.

10:55.072 --> 10:57.158
Now, if you'll excuse me,

10:57.408 --> 10:59.327
told Sheldon I was going to the market

10:59.994 --> 11:01.162
so taking some of your stuff.

11:11.672 --> 11:12.882
I was never here.

11:16.177 --> 11:18.179
Sometimes you don't see it
'cause she's next to Sheldon,

11:18.262 --> 11:19.388
but she's pretty weird.

11:22.975 --> 11:24.935
Okay, all hooked up. Here we go.

11:25.394 --> 11:27.355
I hope there's
nothing disturbing on there.

11:27.688 --> 11:28.939
Like you two in a hot tub?

11:31.567 --> 11:33.486
Hold on, now I'm getting a picture.

11:38.324 --> 11:39.658
It's not very much to go on.

11:40.117 --> 11:42.912
Oh, that's plenty to go on.

11:45.081 --> 11:47.208
We can't give up, we gotta find her.

11:49.210 --> 11:50.920
You just wanna find her
'cause she's cute.

11:51.170 --> 11:52.963
Not just because she's cute.

11:53.339 --> 11:54.840
She also owns a pretty expensive drone

11:54.924 --> 11:57.551
which means she has money
and doesn't mind wasting it

11:57.968 --> 11:59.345
and I... I like that in a woman.

12:01.389 --> 12:03.140
Do you see anything
that can help us locate her?

12:03.682 --> 12:04.934
Mmm, let me have a look.

12:05.017 --> 12:06.143
She's got eagle eyes.

12:06.310 --> 12:08.646
Always spotting
continuity errors in movies.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.773
It's not annoying at all.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.610
Oh, there. Right there.

12:15.111 --> 12:17.947
Check out the pin on her jacket,
isn't that from the comic book store?

12:18.572 --> 12:20.449
Mmm. Is it? Hey, Howard, zoom in.

12:21.659 --> 12:23.035
Fine, zooming in.

12:27.164 --> 12:29.625
Yeah, I know you're being a jerk,
but it's actually helpful.

12:32.962 --> 12:33.963
Hey.

12:34.046 --> 12:35.714
Hi, we're your neighbors
from downstairs.

12:36.006 --> 12:37.049
We've met.

12:37.967 --> 12:40.970
Remember I invited you
to my housewarming when I moved in?

12:41.470 --> 12:44.098
Oh, yeah, sorry, you know,
it's been a crazy couple of months.

12:44.515 --> 12:45.891
That was two years ago.

12:48.811 --> 12:49.812
Welcome to the building.

12:51.480 --> 12:54.275
So I'm running for
president of the tenants association,

12:54.358 --> 12:55.651
I could really use your vote.

12:55.860 --> 12:58.779
You said you were gonna stop by,
I bought a lot of food.

13:00.531 --> 13:03.367
Anyway, meeting's tomorrow,
we really hope you can make it.

13:03.659 --> 13:05.327
- I'll be there.
- Ah, really?

13:05.411 --> 13:07.413
Yeah, you should buy a lot of food.

13:10.541 --> 13:12.960
So, I'm running for
president of the tenants association

13:13.085 --> 13:14.086
and I could really use your vote.

13:14.545 --> 13:15.546
Uh, who's president now?

13:15.713 --> 13:16.797
Uh, Sheldon Cooper.

13:16.964 --> 13:19.884
You know, about yay tall
and about yay annoying.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.387
So you want me to vote
against Sheldon Cooper?

13:23.762 --> 13:25.014
Yeah. You just need to show up
at a meeting and...

13:25.139 --> 13:26.474
Oh, no, no, no can do.

13:26.557 --> 13:28.058
He's got a restraining order against me.

13:29.560 --> 13:30.561
Really? Why?

13:30.811 --> 13:33.522
- I locked him on the roof once.
- Three times.

13:35.566 --> 13:37.526
So, Mrs. Petrescu, we were hoping

13:37.693 --> 13:40.112
you would vote for Leonard
instead of voting for Sheldon.

13:40.654 --> 13:41.655
Vote Sheldon.

13:43.282 --> 13:44.742
No, no, vote Leonard.

13:45.075 --> 13:46.327
No, vote Leonard.

13:47.953 --> 13:50.623
No. Vote Leonard.

13:52.458 --> 13:53.626
Thank you.

13:57.755 --> 14:00.966
She's wearing a pin from your store.
Do you know who she is?

14:01.050 --> 14:02.134
Oh, sure, yeah, that's Cynthia.

14:02.426 --> 14:03.886
Wha... So she's a customer?

14:04.178 --> 14:06.889
Yeah, yeah,
but I... I haven't seen her in a while.

14:07.014 --> 14:09.600
And before you say anything,
there's a lot of reasons

14:09.683 --> 14:11.727
women stop coming here,
it's not just me.

14:13.687 --> 14:14.688
But this time?

14:14.855 --> 14:16.357
It was me. Yeah.

14:17.399 --> 14:20.486
I was trying out a flirty new smile.

14:25.574 --> 14:29.203
Now, I don't use
the word "ghoulish" a lot

14:31.622 --> 14:33.499
but I just can't think
of another word.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.169
Wait, do you know how to find her?

14:37.419 --> 14:40.047
Yeah, I think I have her address
on my mailing list.

14:40.548 --> 14:42.675
Hey, please let me bring
the drone back to her.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.761
You think you've got a shot?
What if she's married?

14:45.844 --> 14:48.138
- She's not.
- It's meant to be.

14:49.306 --> 14:52.268
Little tip. Uh,
stick with the smiles you know.

14:58.566 --> 14:59.567
Hi, what are you doing?

14:59.817 --> 15:02.486
Leonard and Penny are trying to turn
the tenants against me.

15:02.903 --> 15:04.697
So they are about to see
just what kind of power

15:04.780 --> 15:07.241
the president
of the tenants association wields.

15:08.742 --> 15:11.120
"You must be at least this tall
to use washing machine."

15:13.831 --> 15:15.583
I'm going to hang it up higher
than Leonard.

15:17.626 --> 15:19.253
Then his clothes will smell

15:20.087 --> 15:21.964
and nobody's voting for a man
with smelly clothes. No.

15:22.715 --> 15:25.259
Not when there's a perfectly
unscented incumbent on the ballot.

15:26.677 --> 15:29.888
Sheldon, I have an advanced degree
in the study of the human brain,

15:30.180 --> 15:33.976
so if my fiancé's a raving lunatic,
it's kind of a ding on my reputation.

15:35.477 --> 15:38.647
If leaders just stepped aside every time
they didn't have the consent

15:38.772 --> 15:40.274
of the governed, what would we have?

15:40.691 --> 15:41.900
Democracy.

15:44.570 --> 15:45.863
Not on my watch.

15:50.951 --> 15:54.038
Okay, don't be weird,
don't be weird, don't be weird.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.123
Hello.

15:56.915 --> 15:59.084
Hey, you found my drone.

15:59.460 --> 16:02.046
Yeah, yes, it took a while
to track you down,

16:02.129 --> 16:04.590
but to see the look on your face,
it was worth it.

16:04.882 --> 16:06.008
Aw.

16:06.091 --> 16:07.092
That's sweet.

16:07.426 --> 16:08.427
Rajesh.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.262
- Cynthia.
- Pleasure to meet you.

16:10.387 --> 16:11.597
Likewise.

16:12.973 --> 16:14.933
I feel like I should give you
a reward or something.

16:15.059 --> 16:16.560
Oh, no, you don't have to do that.

16:16.644 --> 16:18.646
- No, I insist.
- How about your phone number?

16:20.731 --> 16:21.732
Give me your phone.

16:26.153 --> 16:29.239
Thanks. So, I'll call you, Cynthia.

16:29.657 --> 16:31.784
Great, Rajesh.

16:31.867 --> 16:33.744
- And thanks again.
- Uh, sure.

16:38.832 --> 16:39.833
Just checking.

16:45.964 --> 16:49.885
Hey, Sheldon,
we found something pretty interesting.

16:50.761 --> 16:51.804
Huh.

16:51.887 --> 16:53.514
Well, that is surprising.

16:54.932 --> 16:57.476
I for one have no idea
what they're talking about.

16:58.686 --> 17:01.230
Turns out, when Amy took over
Penny's apartment

17:01.438 --> 17:03.774
she was put on the lease, not you.

17:04.024 --> 17:05.401
Yeah and when I moved across the hall

17:05.484 --> 17:07.569
you got taken off the lease
and I got added.

17:07.986 --> 17:09.863
What are you saying?

17:10.364 --> 17:12.908
That Sheldon's not technically
a tenant at all

17:13.033 --> 17:16.120
and therefore has no standing to be
president of the tenants association

17:16.203 --> 17:17.621
no matter who votes for him?

17:19.623 --> 17:23.001
I don't know how you found that out
but I'm guessing all on your own.

17:24.294 --> 17:27.089
So looks like we need to figure out
who the new president should be.

17:27.172 --> 17:28.882
- I nominate myself.
- I second it.

17:29.466 --> 17:30.676
Huh.

17:30.968 --> 17:33.637
Well, as a woman in love,
I want to stand by my man.

17:34.513 --> 17:36.974
Too bad that's been rendered
bureaucratically impossible.

17:39.727 --> 17:42.020
Well, this is hard for me

17:42.479 --> 17:44.732
because I do love a legal technicality,

17:44.857 --> 17:46.150
and this is a good one.

17:46.442 --> 17:50.070
Although not quite as good
as the provision in California law

17:50.195 --> 17:54.450
which states a person who occupies
a dwelling for thirty consecutive days

17:54.533 --> 17:56.827
becomes a tenant at will. And as such...

17:56.910 --> 17:58.120
- I vote for Leonard.
- You...

18:00.122 --> 18:01.165
What?

18:01.290 --> 18:02.624
I'm sorry, Sheldon.

18:02.875 --> 18:05.627
With minimal power
comes minimal responsibility,

18:06.295 --> 18:07.296
and you couldn't handle it.

18:07.463 --> 18:08.464
You...

18:09.465 --> 18:11.383
Don't you misquote <i>Spider-Man</i> to me.

18:12.593 --> 18:14.052
It's not your fault.

18:14.303 --> 18:16.263
I mean, what man
wouldn't be seduced by the power

18:16.346 --> 18:18.474
to decide how late
the laundry room stays open?

18:19.892 --> 18:22.936
Wait, you're the reason I had to come
back and get my jeans the next morning?

18:24.605 --> 18:26.398
I can't believe you expect me
to give that up.

18:28.776 --> 18:32.321
Sheldon, it's the American way,
the peaceful transfer of power.

18:32.571 --> 18:33.864
I don't know.

18:34.281 --> 18:35.657
Think about <i>Ant-Man.</i>

18:35.908 --> 18:37.326
I'm always thinking about <i>Ant-Man.</i>

18:39.328 --> 18:42.998
Michael Douglas had the suit
and then he passed it on to Paul Rudd.

18:45.542 --> 18:46.877
Maybe you're right.

18:47.169 --> 18:49.505
Really? The <i>Ant-Man</i> thing,
that's what won you over?

18:50.923 --> 18:53.926
Yes, he got the details right,
that's how you use a superhero.

18:55.719 --> 18:58.597
I suppose it is time
I pass this on to Leonard.

18:58.806 --> 19:00.307
- Thank you.
- Yeah, thanks.

19:00.516 --> 19:02.100
Uh, I know that's hard for you.

19:02.267 --> 19:04.686
Well, it was, but you know what?

19:05.229 --> 19:09.608
Instead of being in charge,
I can now be the vocal opposition,

19:09.858 --> 19:13.111
criticizing and badgering
the president at every turn.

19:13.529 --> 19:15.322
I think you'll be really good at that.

19:16.824 --> 19:17.825
Me too.

19:19.701 --> 19:21.495
I think I've made a huge mistake.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.206
Me too.

19:30.921 --> 19:32.256
Can't believe you got her number.

19:32.339 --> 19:34.049
I know, right?

19:34.299 --> 19:36.468
How amazing would it be
if this worked out

19:36.677 --> 19:38.136
and the story of how I met my wife

19:38.262 --> 19:40.389
started with you and me
in the hot tub together?

19:43.308 --> 19:46.520
No, do us both a favor
and start the story later.

19:47.896 --> 19:52.150
Whatever. I have a good feeling about
this girl, like we really hit it off.

19:53.485 --> 19:55.821
<i>Stop flying it around,
you're gonna break it.</i>

19:56.488 --> 19:57.698
<i>Why do you care?</i>

19:58.365 --> 20:01.243
<i>Because we have to give it back
to the beautiful mystery girl.</i>

20:01.451 --> 20:04.288
- Aw.
<i>- I mean, did you see how hot she was!</i>

20:04.371 --> 20:07.165
<i>I want to get all up on that
and start making babies.</i>

20:09.293 --> 20:13.255
<i>I know exactly what underwear
I'm gonna wear on our first date.</i>

20:13.338 --> 20:14.590
<i>None!</i>

20:40.949 --> 20:41.950
English - SDH
