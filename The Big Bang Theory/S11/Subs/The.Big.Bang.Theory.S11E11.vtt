00:02.045 --> 00:03.672
<i>Previously
on</i> The Big Bang Theory...

00:04.464 --> 00:05.799
Want to grab some lunch?

00:06.549 --> 00:08.385
You know what? I don't think so.

00:08.468 --> 00:10.136
Well, let me guess, you're not eating

00:10.220 --> 00:13.723
because the mean girls circled
your chubby bits in marker?

00:14.766 --> 00:16.184
No. That, that right there.

00:16.267 --> 00:18.728
That's the reason.
You're always making fun of me.

00:19.145 --> 00:20.605
Those are just jokes.

00:20.689 --> 00:22.982
It's my way of saying
that we're friends,

00:23.066 --> 00:25.985
and it wouldn't hurt you to drop a few.

00:27.445 --> 00:29.864
Fifteen years of constant ridicule.

00:30.198 --> 00:33.159
I think our relationship
has become toxic.

00:33.451 --> 00:35.245
What are you saying?

00:36.746 --> 00:39.249
I think you and I need to spend
some time away from each other.

00:41.501 --> 00:42.752
Look, I...

00:43.044 --> 00:45.046
I can see you're upset, but...

00:45.171 --> 00:48.550
I'm gonna need some ground rules.

00:48.967 --> 00:51.886
While we're apart,
can I see other needy Indian men?

00:52.011 --> 00:53.304
Get out!

00:56.891 --> 00:58.810
Hi Stuart, two questions.

00:58.893 --> 01:00.979
Do you have the new <i>Aquaman,</i>

01:01.146 --> 01:04.733
and do you mind if I use your
back room to smoke some meat?

01:07.318 --> 01:08.361
Well, since it's you asking,

01:08.445 --> 01:11.698
I'm gonna guess that's not a euphemism.

01:12.824 --> 01:14.409
Why are you smoking meat?

01:14.492 --> 01:16.661
And why are you reading <i>Aquaman?</i>

01:17.704 --> 01:21.040
I am trying to make Amy
a historically accurate

01:21.124 --> 01:24.377
<i>Little House on the Prairie</i>
dinner for her birthday, and

01:24.461 --> 01:27.797
I want to be able to say I was
reading it before it was cool.

01:28.506 --> 01:30.300
Wow, well, that's actually really sweet.

01:30.383 --> 01:32.969
The dinner thing.
The <i>Aquaman</i> thing's dumb.

01:34.471 --> 01:37.265
Is-Isn't Halley's birthday
the same as Amy's?

01:37.348 --> 01:39.559
Yeah, but we're not doing
anything big 'cause she's one,

01:39.642 --> 01:42.771
Bernadette's on bed rest, and I'm lazy.

01:44.689 --> 01:45.732
Hey, guys.

01:45.815 --> 01:47.233
- Hello.
- Hey.

01:47.942 --> 01:49.194
Howard.

01:49.319 --> 01:50.528
Raj.

01:51.404 --> 01:52.989
Excuse me.

01:53.656 --> 01:55.492
Really? Is this still happening?

01:55.575 --> 01:58.369
I'm willing to make up,
but someone's being a baby.

01:58.453 --> 02:01.289
I do love a riddle. Let me see.

02:01.998 --> 02:03.708
See, my first guess would be Halley,

02:03.792 --> 02:05.668
but that'd be strange to
accuse her of being a baby

02:05.752 --> 02:07.253
'cause she is a baby.

02:07.337 --> 02:09.172
Erm, I suppose it could be Stuart,

02:09.255 --> 02:11.841
his head does have
a certain milky scent.

02:15.553 --> 02:16.763
Although...

02:16.846 --> 02:19.641
It's me, Sheldon.
He's calling me a baby.

02:19.724 --> 02:23.186
No, I don't know. I saw Leonard
put his keys in his mouth today.

02:24.604 --> 02:26.856
You're a grown man. Act like it.

02:26.981 --> 02:30.109
Big talk coming from a guy
holding an <i>Archie</i> comic book.

02:30.193 --> 02:33.321
Hey, werewolf Jughead
is not your dad's Jughead.

02:34.072 --> 02:37.075
Come on, you guys have been
friends forever. Quit fighting.

02:37.158 --> 02:38.284
I have an extra ticket

02:38.368 --> 02:39.828
to the opening of <i>The Last Jedi</i> tonight.

02:39.911 --> 02:42.205
It was gonna be Howard's,
but you can have it.

02:42.622 --> 02:44.165
You two had a good run.

03:12.485 --> 03:14.737
Who wants to go see
<i>Last Jedi</i> again tonight?

03:14.821 --> 03:16.364
- I'm in.
- Me, too.

03:16.447 --> 03:18.992
It'll be nice to see the parts
I missed while I was blinking.

03:20.451 --> 03:21.828
Hey, guys, there's a change of plans.

03:21.911 --> 03:24.455
We are having a party
for Halley's birthday after all.

03:24.539 --> 03:28.751
Turns out Bernadette and "anyone
who's not a heartless monster"

03:28.835 --> 03:31.170
thinks that's the right thing to do.

03:31.421 --> 03:33.882
I don't like kids,
but I do like birthday cake.

03:33.965 --> 03:36.968
No. Wait, will there be
sugary icing flowers on it?

03:37.135 --> 03:38.344
I don't know.

03:38.553 --> 03:40.555
I'll risk it.

03:40.847 --> 03:43.516
But if I have a tantrum and have
to leave early, you'll know why.

03:45.310 --> 03:48.021
Here you go. Here you go.

03:49.772 --> 03:51.149
See you two there.

03:51.232 --> 03:52.358
Are you kidding me?

03:52.442 --> 03:54.319
You're not gonna invite me
to Halley's birthday?

03:54.402 --> 03:56.487
I'm her godfather, that means something.

03:56.654 --> 03:59.782
Or, hear me out on this. It doesn't.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.243
Okay, that's enough.

04:02.327 --> 04:05.830
This fight either has to end
or get way more entertaining.

04:06.623 --> 04:09.918
Don't worry about it 'cause
I'm done putting up with him!

04:15.506 --> 04:17.342
I know you have a lot on your mind,

04:17.425 --> 04:19.928
but when do you think we'll have
an answer on those cake flowers?

04:23.973 --> 04:26.100
- Hey.
- Hey. What you reading?

04:26.184 --> 04:27.852
It's your brother's Christmas letter.

04:28.019 --> 04:31.272
Ugh. If there's a picture
of his wife and his kids

04:31.356 --> 04:34.067
and his dogs and his horses
all in matching pajamas,

04:34.150 --> 04:36.110
I beg you to burn it.

04:36.653 --> 04:39.280
The people's pajamas
have little horses on them,

04:39.364 --> 04:41.783
and the horses have little people.

04:42.533 --> 04:45.161
It's just his chance to brag
about how great his life is.

04:45.244 --> 04:46.371
Oh, come on, it's nice.

04:46.454 --> 04:47.997
You know that nonprofit he works with?

04:48.081 --> 04:50.083
They built a hospital in Rwanda.

04:50.333 --> 04:53.503
"Look at me.
I built a hospital in Rwanda."

04:54.629 --> 04:57.382
That is a good point.
I hadn't thought of it that way.

04:58.049 --> 04:59.384
- Hello.
- Hey.

04:59.467 --> 05:02.679
So this is for Amy's birthday.
Can I leave it here?

05:02.845 --> 05:03.888
Sure. What is it?

05:03.972 --> 05:05.264
A butter churn.

05:05.348 --> 05:07.225
Ooh. That's what I got her.

05:08.935 --> 05:12.230
It's for her surprise
frontier birthday dinner.

05:12.313 --> 05:13.773
I am making

05:13.856 --> 05:16.401
hardtack, boiled salt pork,

05:16.484 --> 05:20.446
and because it's a special day,
a chewable gob of tree sap.

05:22.323 --> 05:23.491
Is that good?

05:23.574 --> 05:25.493
Compared to other foods, no.

05:25.576 --> 05:27.495
Compared to other parts of a tree?
Meh.

05:30.456 --> 05:33.584
And then after dinner,
we will have birthday coitus.

05:34.961 --> 05:37.672
Do you think that will also
be historically accurate?

05:37.797 --> 05:40.133
I assume like the rest of frontier life,

05:40.216 --> 05:42.427
it'll be exhausting and short.

05:43.553 --> 05:45.430
You're exhausting and short.

05:51.185 --> 05:54.731
Hey, Stuart, you're coming
to Halley's party, right?

05:55.106 --> 05:58.401
You bet.
Plus, I live there and I was invited,

05:58.484 --> 06:01.029
so it's already better
than my 10th birthday party.

06:02.488 --> 06:04.991
- Great. Can you bring a few things?
- Sure. What do you need?

06:05.074 --> 06:06.284
Balloons, streamers,

06:06.367 --> 06:08.411
ice, snacks, a bounce house,
face painter,

06:08.494 --> 06:10.079
and a couple kids whose parents
are willing to lie and say

06:10.163 --> 06:12.457
they know me from the Daddy
and Me class I've never been to.

06:13.958 --> 06:15.793
Where do you and Halley go every week?

06:15.918 --> 06:17.712
The important thing is we're together,

06:17.795 --> 06:20.715
and if the movie gets
too violent, I cover her eyes.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.469
Don't stress about this party.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.179
She's one, she's not gonna remember.

06:26.262 --> 06:29.265
The other day I showed her
her toe, and she was shocked.

06:30.975 --> 06:32.935
It's not for the baby,
it's for Bernadette.

06:33.061 --> 06:34.353
She's feeling guilty

06:34.437 --> 06:36.939
about all the stuff
she's missing with Halley.

06:37.023 --> 06:38.232
All right.

06:38.316 --> 06:40.234
Uncle Stuart's got your back.

06:40.359 --> 06:42.570
Ain't no party like a Stuart party

06:42.653 --> 06:46.115
because Stuart's
never invited to parties.

06:51.537 --> 06:53.331
Did the electricity go out?

06:53.873 --> 06:55.750
I don't know what you mean
by "electricity," ma'am.

06:55.833 --> 06:59.128
I am just a farmer boy living in
a little house on the prairie.

07:05.551 --> 07:06.803
I'm glad you're happy.

07:06.886 --> 07:09.305
I wanted to do something special
for your birthday.

07:09.388 --> 07:13.309
You did,
you did! It's perfect!

07:13.476 --> 07:15.394
You do know that my birthday's
tomorrow, right?

07:15.561 --> 07:18.648
This is just step one
of your birthday weekend.

07:18.773 --> 07:22.777
Now, would you care to join me
for an authentic frontier dinner

07:22.860 --> 07:24.237
made entirely from scratch?

07:24.320 --> 07:27.448
I can't believe you did this.
It's amazing!

07:27.532 --> 07:29.450
Oh, it's not a big deal.

07:29.534 --> 07:31.577
Just to be clear, it was a big deal.

07:33.579 --> 07:35.665
I was being modest. You got that, right?

07:36.124 --> 07:37.875
- Loud and clear.
- Well, I hope you're hungry.

07:37.959 --> 07:39.168
Oh, I'm starving.

07:39.252 --> 07:43.339
Oh, good. Starvation is authentic
to the time period.

07:44.632 --> 07:46.259
If you also have malaria

07:46.342 --> 07:48.136
and a deep distrust of Native Americans,

07:48.219 --> 07:50.304
we're really cooking with a wood stove.

07:51.139 --> 07:52.515
Is that butter?

07:52.598 --> 07:54.475
Yes. But don't blow it all
on one biscuit.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.310
Took me nine hours to make that.

07:57.353 --> 07:59.856
I think I got churner's elbow.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.817
I know we only have coitus
on my birthday,

08:02.900 --> 08:05.695
but I don't know if I can wait
until midnight.

08:06.737 --> 08:08.447
Well, you'll be glad you did.

08:08.531 --> 08:10.241
Everyone knows the best foreplay

08:10.324 --> 08:12.535
is rigid adherence to a strict schedule.

08:17.415 --> 08:18.666
Hey. What are you doing?

08:18.749 --> 08:21.586
Oh, I've decided to write
my own Christmas letter.

08:21.669 --> 08:22.670
So I'm gonna make a list

08:22.753 --> 08:24.297
of all the cool things we did this year.

08:24.505 --> 08:26.465
Oh! Fun. Can I help?

08:26.549 --> 08:29.635
Yes. Can you think of a single
cool thing we did this year?

08:31.179 --> 08:34.098
Well, both of our jobs are going great.

08:34.432 --> 08:37.268
Sure. I mean, my Air Force
project got taken away,

08:37.351 --> 08:40.229
and you're not crazy about
selling pharmaceuticals.

08:41.981 --> 08:44.567
I'll just write down "still employed."

08:45.943 --> 08:47.987
Oh!
We had our second anniversary.

08:48.070 --> 08:49.530
Yeah, but we did

08:49.655 --> 08:50.823
kind of forget about it,

08:50.907 --> 08:54.076
so... Maybe just write "still married."

08:56.162 --> 08:57.747
Great. Okay.

08:58.122 --> 08:59.999
Okay, that's a start.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.002
What else?

09:05.588 --> 09:09.342
You know, maybe this is enough.

09:10.885 --> 09:13.971
Let's look at our pictures.
That'll jog our memories.

09:15.306 --> 09:16.599
What is that a picture of?

09:16.682 --> 09:19.185
Oh, that's a mole on my back.

09:21.437 --> 09:23.272
I wanted to make sure
it wasn't growing, so...

09:24.273 --> 09:26.150
How'd you get a picture
of your own back?

09:26.234 --> 09:28.277
Sheldon took it.
We're kind of mole buddies.

09:31.113 --> 09:32.573
Hey, that's a cute picture.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.450
Isn't that the day
we almost went to the beach?

09:34.533 --> 09:35.534
Memorial Day?

09:35.618 --> 09:37.745
No, that was the day we almost
went to the mountains.

09:37.828 --> 09:39.163
Oh.

09:39.497 --> 09:40.998
That's the great thing about California,

09:41.082 --> 09:42.083
you can almost go to the mountains

09:42.166 --> 09:43.209
and almost go to the beach
in the same day.

09:43.292 --> 09:44.752
Yeah.

09:52.260 --> 09:53.886
Look, I'm sorry about
not inviting you

09:53.970 --> 09:55.930
to Halley's birthday.
That wasn't cool.

09:56.013 --> 09:58.516
And of course we would
love to have you. Here.

10:00.518 --> 10:02.520
Thank you.
I'd really like to be there.

10:02.603 --> 10:05.648
Great, 'cause it's tomorrow,
and I need you to plan it.

10:08.150 --> 10:09.318
What?

10:09.402 --> 10:10.403
Stuart was gonna help,

10:10.486 --> 10:12.863
but the free clinic had
an open spot for a colonoscopy,

10:12.947 --> 10:14.490
and he jumped on it.

10:15.616 --> 10:19.745
Wait, so you're just apologizing
because you need something?

10:20.162 --> 10:23.457
Yes, and I think it's pretty
mature of me to admit it.

10:23.666 --> 10:25.668
Well, that's very insulting.

10:25.751 --> 10:28.504
Right again.
Are you gonna help me or not?

10:29.005 --> 10:30.840
No, I will not help you.

10:33.592 --> 10:35.428
But I will help Halley.

10:35.886 --> 10:37.972
She's my goddaughter, and I love her.

10:38.389 --> 10:39.682
And I have a lot of party favors

10:39.765 --> 10:41.809
left over from
Cinnamon's birthday, so...

10:43.686 --> 10:46.856
I hope she likes things that
squeak when you chew on them.

10:47.606 --> 10:50.443
She's a human being, not an animal.

10:50.526 --> 10:52.695
But that actually would be a hit.

10:55.990 --> 10:57.616
Can I get you anything else?

10:58.075 --> 11:00.745
No, thanks. I think I'm good.

11:00.828 --> 11:03.789
You sure?
There's still plenty of pork fat.

11:04.707 --> 11:07.460
Although, if we don't eat it,
I suppose we could turn it into soap.

11:09.045 --> 11:10.963
That might taste better.

11:14.258 --> 11:16.344
I think I'm just gonna go over here
and sit on the couch.

11:16.719 --> 11:19.722
Great. Then we will move on
to stage two,

11:19.805 --> 11:21.932
the pitching of woo.

11:23.893 --> 11:25.436
Ooh!

11:27.313 --> 11:31.192
Should I read you some bawdy
19th century limericks?

11:31.609 --> 11:32.943
Okay.

11:33.235 --> 11:34.278
Oh, here.

11:34.362 --> 11:37.031
"There once was a priest
from Terre Haute

11:37.198 --> 11:39.784
"who purchased a sheep and a goat..."

11:41.577 --> 11:42.870
Hold on a second.

11:43.079 --> 11:44.622
Is it getting hot in here?

11:44.705 --> 11:46.874
Well, I didn't even get
to the dirty part yet.

11:48.501 --> 11:50.294
No, I'm serious.

11:50.836 --> 11:53.047
Do you think there was
something wrong with that food?

11:53.339 --> 11:56.050
Frontier scallops? I shouldn't think so.

11:57.468 --> 11:59.303
My stomach's feeling a little weird.

11:59.428 --> 12:01.764
Yeah. Mine, too.

12:01.889 --> 12:05.393
I'm sure it's just the first
sharp cramps of arousal.

12:12.441 --> 12:14.693
No. This doesn't feel right.

12:14.777 --> 12:17.530
Hey, hey, save that sexy talk
for the bedroom.

12:19.949 --> 12:21.784
You know, if you'll excuse me,

12:21.867 --> 12:25.162
I am just going to go freshen up.

12:30.334 --> 12:31.335
Sheldon?

12:31.419 --> 12:32.795
<i>I'll be out in a minute.</i>

12:33.462 --> 12:35.297
I don't have a minute!

12:42.346 --> 12:44.765
I can't believe you pulled
this all together overnight.

12:44.890 --> 12:47.643
If I had more time, I could
have gotten the Blue Man Group.

12:49.019 --> 12:50.729
One of them goes to my dry cleaner.

12:50.855 --> 12:52.940
Who, by the way, hates him.

12:54.150 --> 12:55.443
You really saved the day.

12:55.526 --> 12:57.862
Well, it's not for you. It's for Halley.

12:58.070 --> 12:59.113
<i>And I'm sure</i>

12:59.196 --> 13:02.825
she'd appreciate it, if she knew
what's going on or who you are.

13:11.208 --> 13:12.585
Morning.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.420
Happy birthday.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.922
Yeah, sure.

13:19.133 --> 13:20.718
Did you sleep at all?

13:20.843 --> 13:22.887
No. You?

13:23.304 --> 13:26.098
I passed out on the toilet once.

13:27.141 --> 13:29.268
I don't know if that counts.

13:30.269 --> 13:31.353
Feel any better?

13:31.520 --> 13:33.606
I feel terrible.

13:35.357 --> 13:37.067
Well,

13:37.985 --> 13:40.196
should we make love now?

13:41.739 --> 13:44.283
How can you even think about sex?

13:44.366 --> 13:48.204
Hey, I'm a man,
I have annual needs just like anyone.

13:49.038 --> 13:52.041
And besides,
it's our birthday tradition.

13:54.168 --> 13:55.836
You think you can do it

13:56.086 --> 13:59.215
while I lie perfectly still
and you don't touch me?

14:01.634 --> 14:03.511
I can try.

14:09.558 --> 14:11.685
Want to do it again?

14:14.563 --> 14:16.732
- Morning.
- Morning.

14:17.399 --> 14:20.027
"Kept Fern alive"? Who's Fern?

14:22.446 --> 14:24.657
No, the fern. The one in the bathroom.

14:25.032 --> 14:27.952
We're really calling
that brown thing alive? Okay.

14:30.079 --> 14:32.039
So, how long have you
been working on this?

14:32.122 --> 14:33.541
Couple of hours.

14:33.624 --> 14:36.835
I took a break to try to beat
my high score on <i>Mario Kart.</i>

14:37.044 --> 14:38.504
Well, did you do it?

14:38.754 --> 14:40.464
Do you see it on the board?

14:41.590 --> 14:43.968
Okay, this is silly.
Our lives are great.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.094
I think so, too.

14:45.219 --> 14:47.304
So then why is this bugging you so much?

14:47.721 --> 14:52.226
I guess it feels like everyone's
moving forward, and we're stuck.

14:52.309 --> 14:53.310
What do you mean?

14:53.394 --> 14:57.565
Well, we've been married two years.
Should we think about what's next?

14:57.648 --> 15:00.234
Like buying a house or having a baby?

15:00.317 --> 15:02.152
Look, I want to do
all those things someday,

15:02.236 --> 15:03.946
but there's a bunch of stuff
I want to do first.

15:04.113 --> 15:05.197
Okay, like what?

15:05.447 --> 15:08.784
I don't know, stay thin and have money.

15:09.660 --> 15:11.161
No, no, I'm serious.

15:11.245 --> 15:13.581
If there's things we want to do,
let's start doing them.

15:13.956 --> 15:16.875
Okay. Well, we've never been
on a big trip together.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.210
I would love that.

15:18.294 --> 15:19.587
Okay, there's something for your letter.

15:19.670 --> 15:22.339
"Considered going on a trip."

15:24.341 --> 15:25.634
It's just a day trip,

15:25.718 --> 15:28.262
but we could take the ferry
out to Catalina.

15:28.387 --> 15:29.680
Great, let's do it.

15:29.930 --> 15:32.266
Amy's in the bathroom and I need to...

15:38.814 --> 15:41.150
It's like I can hear the ocean already.

15:44.069 --> 15:46.655
Okay. Thanks for letting me know.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.157
Hey, what's going on?

15:48.240 --> 15:51.327
Bernadette's sister's kids are sick
and they're not coming.

15:51.577 --> 15:54.580
But they're the whole reason
the cupcakes are vegan!

15:55.831 --> 15:58.250
<i>- How's the party coming?</i>
- Good!

15:58.500 --> 16:01.378
Great! Our friends
should be here any second!

16:01.712 --> 16:04.465
Those are the only
other people you invited?

16:04.548 --> 16:06.842
What about the kids
from the Daddy and Me class?

16:06.925 --> 16:08.344
Grow up.

16:12.181 --> 16:14.350
- Uh-oh.
- What?

16:14.433 --> 16:16.352
I left the food out.

16:16.769 --> 16:19.021
You afraid it's gonna go good?

16:23.192 --> 16:24.985
How are you feeling?

16:25.611 --> 16:29.031
My stomach aches, I got the chills,

16:29.490 --> 16:31.158
my mouth tastes weird,

16:31.575 --> 16:34.745
it hurts to swallow,
and I've got a little double vision.

16:34.870 --> 16:36.246
Yeah.

16:36.538 --> 16:38.082
I'm feeling better, too.

16:46.799 --> 16:49.760
- Well, this party's a disaster.
- Don't blame the party!

16:49.843 --> 16:51.512
You know how many favors
I had to call in

16:51.595 --> 16:54.556
with my bounce house guy
to get Wonder Woman?

16:55.766 --> 16:57.768
Is that Wonder Woman?

16:59.353 --> 17:01.105
Technically,
it's a Chinese knockoff called

17:01.188 --> 17:03.315
Happy Strong Swimsuit Lady.

17:04.274 --> 17:06.777
Then I take it back, it's a great party.

17:07.319 --> 17:09.113
Well, you can sit here
and sulk if you want.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.198
I'm gonna go celebrate
Halley's first birthday.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.992
Which I planned with no help from you.

17:14.201 --> 17:15.369
What are you doing?

17:15.452 --> 17:18.330
It's a bounce house!
I'm gonna go bounce in it!

17:19.832 --> 17:21.458
You're supposed to take your shoes off

17:21.542 --> 17:23.085
before you go in there!

17:25.671 --> 17:27.214
You know what?

17:27.339 --> 17:30.092
I'm stressed about
my daughter's birthday party.

17:30.175 --> 17:31.593
I don't need your attitude.

17:31.677 --> 17:32.928
Well, I worked really hard on this,

17:33.095 --> 17:35.055
and you haven't even said thank you.

17:35.139 --> 17:36.598
I'm sorry. Thank you.

17:36.765 --> 17:37.808
Thank you for blaming me

17:37.891 --> 17:39.685
for everything
that's wrong in your life!

17:39.768 --> 17:42.396
Thank you for walking out
on our friendship!

17:42.563 --> 17:43.897
You are welcome!

17:43.981 --> 17:46.400
And thank you for mocking me
for all of these years!

17:46.483 --> 17:48.777
Thank you for making it so easy!

17:50.696 --> 17:52.489
Why are you being such a jerk?

17:52.573 --> 17:56.535
Because you're my best friend
and you hurt my feelings!

17:56.618 --> 17:59.455
Well, you're my best friend
and you hurt my feelings!

18:01.707 --> 18:04.209
I can't believe you shoved me!

18:06.378 --> 18:08.046
Well, I can't believe you shoved me!

18:08.130 --> 18:09.715
But it was kind of fun, wasn't it?

18:09.923 --> 18:12.259
- It was! Do it again!
- Gladly!

18:14.261 --> 18:16.597
Okay, now at the same time!

18:18.307 --> 18:19.600
That was awesome!

18:19.683 --> 18:22.144
Yeah, okay, this time, knees, then feet.

18:22.227 --> 18:23.729
One, two, three.

18:26.648 --> 18:28.692
Again! Again!

18:33.071 --> 18:34.072
Hello.

18:34.156 --> 18:35.282
- Hi.
- You made it.

18:35.365 --> 18:36.450
How you two feeling?

18:36.533 --> 18:37.785
Oh, a little better.

18:37.868 --> 18:38.911
Those books should have been called

18:38.994 --> 18:41.330
<i>Little Outhouse on the Prairie.</i>

18:42.289 --> 18:44.708
<i>Halley's awake
and ready for her party!</i>

18:44.792 --> 18:45.876
Be right up!

18:45.959 --> 18:48.170
- I want to see the birthday girl.
- I'd love to see her.

18:48.295 --> 18:51.715
<i>Walk slow, it takes a while
to put this bra back on!</i>

18:54.676 --> 18:56.345
You know,

18:56.720 --> 18:58.555
it's still your birthday.

18:59.139 --> 19:00.349
It is.

19:00.432 --> 19:04.353
And we are both feeling better.

19:06.188 --> 19:07.648
We are.

19:08.232 --> 19:09.900
And there's no one in that bounce house.

19:10.067 --> 19:11.443
No.

19:11.902 --> 19:13.362
Great.

19:13.904 --> 19:15.614
Let's go jump for a bit,

19:15.697 --> 19:17.950
and then find a bedroom
to have coitus in.
