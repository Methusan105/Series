WEBVTT

00:03.797 --> 00:06.132
But why do they still call Batman
using the Bat-Signal?

00:06.299 --> 00:08.176
Wouldn't it just be, like,
easier to text him?

00:08.259 --> 00:10.595
The Bat-Signal
isn't just to alert Batman,

00:10.679 --> 00:12.847
it's also to strike fear
in the hearts of his enemies

00:12.931 --> 00:13.973
and let them know he's coming.

00:14.307 --> 00:16.059
Sort of like Sheldon's knock.

00:17.686 --> 00:19.479
Comparing me to Batman? I'll take it.

00:21.690 --> 00:24.818
If we don't do anything how long do you
think they'll talk about Batman?

00:25.068 --> 00:28.905
Well, I've known them for 11 years,
so 11 years.

00:31.032 --> 00:32.659
I believe they do text him.

00:32.742 --> 00:35.203
The Bat-Signal is linked
to his phone via Bluetooth.

00:35.745 --> 00:36.788
Has that been in the comics?

00:36.913 --> 00:38.123
No, it's just what I believe.

00:39.833 --> 00:41.418
All right, I'm putting a stop to this.

00:41.626 --> 00:43.336
If you knew how,
why'd you wait eleven years?

00:45.296 --> 00:46.756
Hey, guys, guess what?

00:47.173 --> 00:50.677
Today at work I found out
I'm going to meet Bill Gates.

00:52.011 --> 00:54.097
Sorry, Leonard,
you and Penny had a good run.

00:55.890 --> 00:57.350
I'm not leaving him for Bill Gates.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.686
Are you sure?
I bet his internet's really fast

01:01.479 --> 01:02.564
How did this happen?

01:02.647 --> 01:05.567
Well, his foundation is looking to
partner with a pharmaceutical company

01:05.650 --> 01:08.820
to help develop affordable vaccines,
so they asked me to show him around.

01:09.320 --> 01:10.780
That's great, when's he coming?

01:11.030 --> 01:12.991
He gets in on Sunday, and Monday morning

01:13.074 --> 01:15.160
I'm gonna give him a tour
of the labs and offices.

01:15.410 --> 01:16.786
Oh.

01:16.911 --> 01:19.122
He gets in on Sunday, April 1st.

01:19.205 --> 01:21.207
Nice try, Penny.

01:23.209 --> 01:24.210
What are you talking about?

01:24.461 --> 01:25.462
April Fools' Day.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.882
This is another one of your classic
pranks you try to pull on me every year.

01:29.549 --> 01:31.176
Literally never pulled a prank on you.

01:32.093 --> 01:34.512
Oh, really? What about last year,
when you sent me that email

01:34.596 --> 01:37.974
with the photo attached
but you didn't attach a photo?

01:38.683 --> 01:39.684
That was a mistake.

01:40.059 --> 01:41.519
Messing with me, yes, it was.

01:42.979 --> 01:44.981
And this year, I'm not falling for it.

01:45.356 --> 01:47.442
- Sheldon, I swear...
- What are you doing?

01:47.776 --> 01:50.236
Oh, you're right.
He's not coming. April Fools.

01:51.613 --> 01:53.990
You know what they say,
fool me n times,

01:54.157 --> 01:57.285
where n equals the amount of times
you've already fooled me, shame on you.

01:57.619 --> 02:00.538
Fool me n plus one times, shame on me.

02:29.400 --> 02:33.238
So you're gonna spend a day
with Bill Gates, I'm a little jealous.

02:33.446 --> 02:34.614
I'm a little nervous.

02:34.697 --> 02:35.824
You know if I do a good job,

02:35.949 --> 02:38.660
I'm hoping they'll consider me
for a PR position that's opening up.

02:39.035 --> 02:41.579
Well, if you're nervous...
I know a lot about him,

02:41.704 --> 02:44.624
I can fill you in
or maybe come along, whatever.

02:46.292 --> 02:47.627
I think I'll be okay.

02:48.044 --> 02:50.630
Well, I'm just saying, what are you
gonna do when he wants to talk about

02:50.839 --> 02:52.882
high-level language interpreters
for microcomputers?

02:53.341 --> 02:56.511
What are high-level language
interpreters for micro-computers?

02:56.678 --> 02:58.179
A way of programming computers

02:58.263 --> 03:00.306
using words and commands
instead of binary code.

03:00.598 --> 03:03.101
Oh, that's actually kind of interesting,
tell me more.

03:03.309 --> 03:04.978
- Oh, well...
- That, I'll do that.

03:08.106 --> 03:09.107
I didn't even see it coming.

03:09.190 --> 03:11.943
Yeah, well, you never do.

03:12.735 --> 03:15.363
Look,
it's just, he's an idol of mine

03:15.488 --> 03:17.532
and I would love the chance
to hang out with him.

03:17.699 --> 03:20.368
Look, I know you want to meet him but
I can't turn this into a social thing,

03:20.493 --> 03:23.204
okay, this is my job,
I really need it to go well.

03:23.580 --> 03:25.206
I get it, I get it, you're right.

03:26.499 --> 03:28.209
Actually, I've already met him
once before.

03:28.376 --> 03:30.128
He gave a talk at Princeton
and my mom took me.

03:30.420 --> 03:31.629
Oh, really? Was he nice?

03:31.713 --> 03:33.214
He was super nice.

03:33.298 --> 03:35.508
I got pretty emotional
and started crying

03:37.302 --> 03:38.803
and he didn't make fun
of me or anything.

03:39.929 --> 03:41.055
Well, you were a kid.

03:46.978 --> 03:48.229
Uh-huh.

03:51.149 --> 03:53.026
Bye, my babies, I love you.

03:53.818 --> 03:55.612
We love you too, Mommy.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.281
Yeah, don't do that.

03:59.032 --> 04:00.033
Bernadette?

04:02.160 --> 04:03.328
Hi. Where are you off to?

04:04.078 --> 04:05.079
<i>El parque.</i>

04:05.455 --> 04:06.456
<i>"El parque?"</i>

04:07.040 --> 04:09.334
Learning Spanish
so I can talk to the other nannies.

04:11.419 --> 04:12.420
How's that going?

04:14.964 --> 04:16.007
Good?

04:16.257 --> 04:17.383
Oh.

04:19.761 --> 04:20.762
<i>No bueno.</i>

04:26.559 --> 04:28.436
- Thanks for coming over.
- No problem.

04:28.645 --> 04:31.105
Can I get you anything?
Juice box? 'Naners?

04:32.190 --> 04:33.191
'Naners?

04:33.274 --> 04:34.859
Sorry. Mom brain.

04:35.109 --> 04:37.195
I think I forgot how to talk
to grown-ups.

04:37.612 --> 04:39.030
I meant Ba-naners.

04:40.990 --> 04:42.575
- You know what, I'm good.
- Okay.

04:42.659 --> 04:45.078
So what are we watching?

04:45.411 --> 04:47.205
<i>Bob the Builder.</i> I'll catch you up.

04:47.580 --> 04:48.581
That one's Bob.

04:50.041 --> 04:51.042
He's a builder.

04:52.794 --> 04:54.337
Isn't this a kid's show?

04:55.046 --> 04:56.839
It's what we watch in this house.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.510
<i>Bob the Builder,
Dinosaur Train</i> and <i>Peppa Pig,</i>

05:00.802 --> 05:02.512
which is both funny and meaningful.

05:05.723 --> 05:07.725
You wanna take a break
and maybe get something to eat?

05:08.101 --> 05:09.102
Sure.

05:12.397 --> 05:14.148
Why does it not feel like we're going?

05:14.816 --> 05:16.901
Hang on, I just want to see
if Bob can fix it.

05:19.195 --> 05:20.321
Yes, he can.

05:25.535 --> 05:26.536
Oh, hey.

05:26.661 --> 05:29.414
I folded your laundry for you.
You're welcome.

05:30.498 --> 05:32.041
Uh, that's not mine.

05:36.421 --> 05:37.922
You're saying that these aren't yours?

05:42.885 --> 05:43.886
No.

05:50.560 --> 05:53.187
So you're saying that I'm touching
a stranger's underpants?

05:53.938 --> 05:54.939
Yes.

06:03.698 --> 06:05.867
And just like that
it's the worst day of my life.

06:07.869 --> 06:10.955
Hey, why are you being so weird?

06:11.039 --> 06:15.209
It occurred to me that perhaps you were
telling the truth about Bill Gates

06:15.293 --> 06:17.378
and it wasn't just
part of an elaborate prank.

06:17.837 --> 06:19.505
What would the prank part even be?

06:20.048 --> 06:23.342
I show up to meet Bill Gates
over your "objections"

06:23.509 --> 06:24.719
but it's not Bill Gates at all,

06:24.886 --> 06:27.221
no, it's one of those look-a-likes
that you hire for a party

06:28.306 --> 06:30.516
and then when I go around
showing everybody the balloon animal

06:30.683 --> 06:32.977
that Bill Gates made for me,
I look like an idiot.

06:35.188 --> 06:37.774
Have you been eating laundry detergent?

06:39.609 --> 06:42.779
I just need you to tell me the truth.
This is driving me crazy.

06:42.987 --> 06:44.697
Sheldon, he is really coming.

06:44.864 --> 06:45.990
- Is he?
- He is.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.366
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:49.368 --> 06:50.870
Well, now I don't know what to believe.

06:54.373 --> 06:57.668
Thanks for getting me out of the house,
I feel like my brain is turning to mush.

06:58.002 --> 06:59.003
Happy to help.

06:59.796 --> 07:01.380
Did I show you the video
of the kids sitting?

07:01.923 --> 07:05.176
Yes, you texted it to me at 3:00 a.m.

07:05.968 --> 07:08.721
Thought someone
was either in jail or dead.

07:09.972 --> 07:10.973
I'm sorry.

07:11.057 --> 07:14.393
No, no, it gave me something to watch
while I tried to go back to sleep.

07:16.479 --> 07:18.231
You know what, I don't wanna be
one of those moms

07:18.314 --> 07:19.649
who can only talk about her kids.

07:20.399 --> 07:22.568
Okay, well,
I'm reading a pretty good book.

07:22.693 --> 07:26.197
It's the untold story of female artists
during the Renaissance.

07:26.531 --> 07:28.366
Oh, I'm in the middle of a book too,

07:28.533 --> 07:30.493
it's three pages long
and it floats in the bath.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.206
All right. We can talk about
something else.

07:35.998 --> 07:38.417
It also quacks when you squeeze it,
you should've seen Michael laugh.

07:38.584 --> 07:39.585
I think I have a video.

07:41.671 --> 07:42.839
Or maybe we can't.

07:48.010 --> 07:50.555
Why is your screen name "John Williams?"

07:51.597 --> 07:53.891
Uh, because I always score.

07:57.228 --> 07:59.605
Hey. I think I'm gonna head
to the office for a little bit.

07:59.856 --> 08:00.857
On a Sunday?

08:00.940 --> 08:03.151
Yeah, just wanna make sure
I'm prepared for tomorrow.

08:03.985 --> 08:06.863
Do you think you could get Bill Gates
to sign something for me?

08:07.113 --> 08:08.239
Yeah, maybe, like what?

08:08.781 --> 08:10.324
My arm, my chest, his call.

08:12.410 --> 08:13.828
His call will be to the police.

08:16.289 --> 08:20.459
Penny, remember when I introduced you
to hundred calorie Dove Bars

08:20.835 --> 08:23.087
and you said you owed me,
like, big time?

08:23.838 --> 08:25.923
Guys, even if I wanted
to introduce you,

08:26.007 --> 08:27.466
there is no room in his schedule.

08:27.633 --> 08:29.051
I mean, look at this itinerary.

08:29.135 --> 08:31.179
I meet him at his hotel
first thing tomorrow morning,

08:31.345 --> 08:32.930
and then we're on the go all day long.

08:33.431 --> 08:35.933
You're right. Guys, this is her job,
we need to respect that.

08:36.100 --> 08:37.101
Thank you, honey.

08:37.310 --> 08:38.311
Proud of you.

08:38.394 --> 08:39.562
Love you.

08:43.107 --> 08:45.109
I totally just saw
what hotel he's staying at.

08:46.569 --> 08:47.653
What are we waiting here for?

08:47.904 --> 08:50.364
For Penny to walk down the stairs,
get in her car and drive away.

08:51.616 --> 08:53.618
Right, smart.

08:58.164 --> 08:59.165
That long enough?

08:59.248 --> 09:00.249
She's pretty quick, let's go.

09:09.050 --> 09:11.219
What would you do
if you had a billion dollars?

09:12.178 --> 09:15.348
Same as Bill Gates,
try to make the world a better place,

09:15.806 --> 09:18.017
but I'd do it
in a working Iron Man suit.

09:19.352 --> 09:21.145
I didn't know that came
in a boys medium.

09:23.689 --> 09:25.942
This is a bad idea,
maybe we should go.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.568
What are you talking about?

09:27.735 --> 09:28.736
I don't know,
I'm just feeling guilty

09:28.819 --> 09:31.322
like I'm kinda sneaking around
behind Penny's back.

09:31.781 --> 09:33.199
We're not doing anything wrong.

09:33.282 --> 09:36.410
We're just hanging out in a hotel
lobby, plenty of people do that.

09:36.744 --> 09:39.455
The businessmen,
the high-end prostitutes.

09:43.876 --> 09:47.338
That's a fun new game, CEO or ho.

09:49.006 --> 09:50.633
No, this is wrong, let's go.

09:51.717 --> 09:54.011
Guys, guys, that's him. Be cool.

09:54.095 --> 09:57.098
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

09:57.890 --> 09:58.891
Cooler.

09:59.058 --> 10:02.144
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

10:03.479 --> 10:06.023
Mr. Gates,
I'm Doctor Leonard Hofstadter,

10:06.107 --> 10:07.149
we've actually met before.

10:07.775 --> 10:08.985
Sorry, I don't remember.

10:09.652 --> 10:13.114
You were so nice...
And it was really special to me

10:13.197 --> 10:15.533
because you've been
such a big influence on my life.

10:15.700 --> 10:18.703
I mean, ever since I was a little kid,
I've looked up to you like a hero.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.539
Oh, now I remember.

10:23.249 --> 10:24.417
Would you like a tissue?

10:25.251 --> 10:26.252
How about a hug?

10:26.752 --> 10:28.129
How about a tissue?

10:31.757 --> 10:33.592
Sorry I talked about my kids
the whole time.

10:34.093 --> 10:35.469
Oh, don't worry about it.

10:35.928 --> 10:38.723
I mean, besides you cutting up
my meat for me, it was a lovely lunch.

10:40.391 --> 10:42.810
God, what's happening?

10:43.144 --> 10:45.938
I'm a smart, educated, successful...

10:46.564 --> 10:47.565
Woman?

10:48.357 --> 10:49.692
I was gonna get it.

10:50.943 --> 10:52.570
Don't be so hard on yourself.

10:53.154 --> 10:55.781
Pregnancy and childbirth
actually cause physical changes

10:55.948 --> 10:57.325
to the structure of your brain.

10:57.575 --> 10:59.702
I liked the old structure of my brain.

11:00.578 --> 11:02.371
But then I liked
a lot of my old structures.

11:03.873 --> 11:06.042
Well, these are positive changes.

11:06.375 --> 11:09.837
Studies with rats show that new mothers
are more sensitive to danger,

11:10.046 --> 11:13.174
better at multitasking
and bolder in the pursuit of food.

11:14.175 --> 11:16.218
I did stick a couple
of lamb chops in my purse.

11:19.388 --> 11:20.639
So that's what I was smelling.

11:22.683 --> 11:26.187
Look, even though your brain
is different, in many ways it's better.

11:26.729 --> 11:27.730
But were you bored?

11:27.980 --> 11:29.106
Of course not.

11:29.315 --> 11:30.316
You're lying.

11:31.025 --> 11:33.361
Which you can tell
because your maternal brain

11:33.444 --> 11:35.321
is better at sensing non-verbal cues.

11:36.947 --> 11:38.366
Now you're just being condescending.

11:38.574 --> 11:40.576
Look at you, two-for-two.

11:46.916 --> 11:48.459
Hold the door, hold the door.

11:54.799 --> 11:56.092
Oh, hi, Leonard.

11:57.343 --> 11:59.053
Didn't you hear me yell "hold the door"?

11:59.428 --> 12:03.391
I did. But you know what they say,
"hold the door, get robbed some more."

12:05.476 --> 12:06.519
No one says that.

12:06.602 --> 12:09.855
Oh. Well, they should
because it's true and it rhymes.

12:12.566 --> 12:13.984
So, where have you been?

12:14.068 --> 12:16.237
Actually, I met Bill Gates.

12:17.571 --> 12:21.242
I see, you're all in on it,
ah, nice try.

12:22.368 --> 12:26.080
It's not an April Fools' joke, Sheldon.
I actually went to a hotel and met him.

12:26.539 --> 12:32.211
Right, right. Okay, so, "Bill Gates"
was at the "hotel" that you "went to."

12:33.879 --> 12:35.214
Why is "went to" in quotes?

12:36.757 --> 12:41.303
Fine. So "Bill Gates" was at the "hotel"
that you went to.

12:44.640 --> 12:45.641
That's you and Bill Gates.

12:46.058 --> 12:47.059
It is.

12:48.352 --> 12:49.562
- Were you crying?
- No.

12:52.857 --> 12:55.901
So it wasn't a joke
and I actually could have met him?

12:56.235 --> 12:57.611
He's probably still there.

12:57.695 --> 12:59.113
What hotel?

12:59.196 --> 13:01.740
The La Quinta Inn in Thousand Oaks
under the name Hernandez.

13:01.991 --> 13:03.993
Thank you. Thank you so much.

13:06.537 --> 13:07.538
April Fools.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.336
- Hey.
- Hey. Where have you been?

13:14.503 --> 13:16.088
Ah, just hanging out with the guys.

13:16.380 --> 13:17.381
They still mad at me?

13:17.590 --> 13:19.758
Uh, they were,
but then I was like, "Hey."

13:19.884 --> 13:21.760
And they were like, "What?"
and I was like, "You know,"

13:21.844 --> 13:23.095
and they were like, "Okay."

13:25.848 --> 13:26.891
You're a good husband.

13:27.057 --> 13:30.102
Well, it's not for me to say but you
just said it so you're probably right.

13:31.103 --> 13:33.397
Well, as it turns out,
there is a little reception

13:33.564 --> 13:36.775
for Mr. Gates tomorrow night, I asked
if I could bring you and they said yes.

13:40.738 --> 13:41.739
What?

13:43.574 --> 13:45.367
Yeah, you get to meet Bill Gates again.

13:46.243 --> 13:47.453
Wait, what do you mean again?

13:48.329 --> 13:49.914
'Cause you met him
that one time with your mom.

13:50.247 --> 13:51.248
Yes.

13:52.583 --> 13:56.420
And then again tomorrow for
a total of two and only two times.

13:57.463 --> 13:59.256
Yeah, I wonder if he'll remember you.

14:00.216 --> 14:01.509
Yeah, I wonder that too.

14:04.803 --> 14:07.431
<i>The sun is losing about six times ten</i>

14:07.515 --> 14:09.391
<i>to the twelfth grams per second</i>

14:10.017 --> 14:12.311
<i>so the fraction of the mass
it loses every year</i>

14:12.394 --> 14:14.688
<i>is about ten to the negative thirteenth.</i>

14:15.189 --> 14:18.275
<i>But don't worry,
it'll be millions of years</i>

14:18.400 --> 14:20.653
<i>before we all freeze to death.</i>

14:25.533 --> 14:27.117
<i>Sweet dreams.</i>

14:30.246 --> 14:33.624
Wow. <i>Hop on Pop</i> took
a dark turn there at the end.

14:34.833 --> 14:37.753
Amy made me realize
that new mothers are cognitively primed

14:37.836 --> 14:39.380
to take in new information,

14:39.463 --> 14:42.550
and I've been wasting it
making up songs about our babies' toes.

14:43.884 --> 14:46.053
To be fair I co-wrote
<i>Pinky Toe Pinky Toe.</i>

14:48.305 --> 14:50.516
Evolution gave me this mom brain
to focus on the baby,

14:50.849 --> 14:53.686
but I figure I can hack it
to learn all kinds of new things.

14:54.103 --> 14:55.312
That's great.

14:55.729 --> 14:57.898
Yeah, there was a problem
and I fixed it.

14:58.399 --> 15:00.693
Like, Bob the Builder
in that giraffe cage.

15:02.319 --> 15:04.613
Spoiler alert,
I didn't see that one yet.

15:09.034 --> 15:11.453
So that's fun,
you get to meet Bill Gates again.

15:12.246 --> 15:13.664
It's not fun, I'm screwed.

15:15.499 --> 15:17.084
It's fun for us.

15:18.836 --> 15:20.087
Maybe he won't remember you.

15:20.671 --> 15:21.964
I snotted on his tie.

15:23.716 --> 15:25.676
Yeah, you did, like a lot.

15:27.720 --> 15:30.681
Hello, Leonard.
I thought I'd find you here.

15:31.724 --> 15:32.725
You snake.

15:34.476 --> 15:35.477
What's going on?

15:35.644 --> 15:38.230
He sent me all the way to Thousand Oaks
to meet Bill Gates

15:38.355 --> 15:40.107
when he knew full well
he wasn't staying there.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.026
Leonard, that's terrible.

15:42.234 --> 15:43.235
Yeah, why would you do that?

15:43.360 --> 15:45.696
You know he's staying
at the Double Tree in Long Beach.

15:48.032 --> 15:49.158
Ah-ha.

15:50.200 --> 15:53.287
Wait, how do I know
you're not tricking me?

15:54.455 --> 15:55.581
We probably are.

15:56.790 --> 15:57.791
But what if we're not?

16:00.252 --> 16:01.670
You think you're so smart.

16:03.922 --> 16:06.425
You think I'm going to fall for it
again, don't you?

16:08.344 --> 16:09.345
Well, I won't.

16:10.471 --> 16:12.139
- Where you going?
- Shut up.

16:16.435 --> 16:19.229
Aw, you sure you can't come?

16:19.730 --> 16:21.815
I want to but I'm just too sick.

16:24.193 --> 16:26.111
You really wanted to meet him.

16:26.195 --> 16:28.864
I know. I've been trying to hide it,
so I could go

16:28.989 --> 16:30.741
but I don't wanna make him sick.

16:32.701 --> 16:35.287
You know, you do look
pretty pale and clammy.

16:40.542 --> 16:41.543
Yeah.

16:43.128 --> 16:44.129
Have fun.

16:44.254 --> 16:45.631
Well, feel better, okay.

16:53.222 --> 16:55.474
No, that's just my regular
pale and clammy.

16:58.936 --> 17:01.647
I mean, really the bigger danger
isn't the loss of mass

17:01.897 --> 17:04.733
instead it will run out of hydrogen
to use for nuclear fuel,

17:04.983 --> 17:07.194
swell up into a red giant
and fry the Earth.

17:09.613 --> 17:11.115
So you don't want to split a salad?

17:12.074 --> 17:14.243
No, thank you.
But speaking of splitting things,

17:14.451 --> 17:16.370
did you hear about
the light-splitting greenhouse film

17:16.495 --> 17:18.372
that could improve
photosynthetic efficiency?

17:19.081 --> 17:20.207
No.

17:21.917 --> 17:24.545
Just a little something I read while
nursing a human being that I made.

17:27.673 --> 17:29.258
- I'm just gonna get the chicken.
- Ah.

17:29.466 --> 17:33.095
N-E-K-C-I-H-C.
Chicken backwards boom, mom brain.

17:36.432 --> 17:37.808
And a whole bottle of wine.

17:40.394 --> 17:43.647
Oh, oh, oh. Oh, in your face.

17:51.029 --> 17:52.030
Hello.

17:53.866 --> 17:55.951
<i>Oh, hey sweetie, how ya feeling?</i>

17:56.243 --> 17:57.870
Oh, okay, I'm just resting.

17:58.287 --> 18:00.748
<i>Well, I have a surprise
that might make you feel better.</i>

18:00.831 --> 18:01.832
Oh, really?

18:01.915 --> 18:03.250
<i>Yeah, look who's here.</i>

18:08.255 --> 18:09.506
<i>Wait, I know you.</i>

18:10.924 --> 18:11.925
No, you don't.

18:13.886 --> 18:17.514
<i>Yes, I do. You were waiting for me
at my hotel.</i>

18:18.056 --> 18:19.641
<i>You ruined my tie.</i>

18:21.101 --> 18:22.644
<i>Wait, what? What's he talking about?</i>

18:22.728 --> 18:23.896
Uh...

18:23.979 --> 18:26.857
He obviously, he's kidding.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.193
That's a good one Bill,
I gotta go.

18:33.238 --> 18:34.823
Stupid Leonard

18:35.491 --> 18:37.576
meeting stupid Bill Gates

18:38.911 --> 18:40.579
without stupid me.

18:45.334 --> 18:46.668
Aw.

18:51.715 --> 18:53.592
I'm so sorry... Sheldon?

18:55.260 --> 18:57.513
Leonard, I can't stay mad at you.

18:59.765 --> 19:01.225
Apology accepted.

19:02.559 --> 19:04.019
What's for dinner? I'm starving.

19:24.498 --> 19:25.499
How are you ladies doing?

19:25.749 --> 19:27.376
Raise your hands, if you're <i>bueno.</i>

19:40.430 --> 19:42.391
<i>Mi Ilamo</i> Stuart Bloom.

20:15.841 --> 20:16.842
