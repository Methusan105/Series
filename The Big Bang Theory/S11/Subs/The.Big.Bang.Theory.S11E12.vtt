WEBVTT

00:04.381 --> 00:06.174
Hey, can you do me a favor?

00:06.383 --> 00:08.843
Can we try to avoid talking to
our friends tonight

00:08.927 --> 00:10.512
about our wedding plans?

00:10.845 --> 00:12.013
I'll do you one better.

00:12.097 --> 00:14.349
I'll avoid talking
to our friends entirely

00:14.432 --> 00:16.351
and play on my phone.

00:17.310 --> 00:19.270
It's just, I haven't picked
a maid of honor yet,

00:19.354 --> 00:21.815
and I'm having trouble deciding
between Penny and Bernadette.

00:22.107 --> 00:25.235
Ah. Understandable.
They are quite similar.

00:25.318 --> 00:29.030
Both blonde former waitresses
who married beneath them.

00:30.240 --> 00:31.658
Penny is my best friend,

00:31.741 --> 00:33.535
but I was Bernadette's
maid of honor,

00:33.618 --> 00:35.245
and I think
she kind of expects it.

00:35.453 --> 00:37.122
So, if anyone brings
it up tonight,

00:37.205 --> 00:39.290
just maybe you can help
me change the subject.

00:39.833 --> 00:43.336
How about this?
I dominate the conversation so hard,

00:43.420 --> 00:46.297
no one has a chance
to get a word in edgewise.

00:48.591 --> 00:51.177
I don't know.
They might see that coming.

00:51.428 --> 00:52.762
What if we have a code word?

00:53.805 --> 00:55.807
Now you're speaking my catamaran.

00:56.808 --> 00:59.102
That's my code word for "language."

00:59.894 --> 01:02.397
Okay, fine, catamaran.
That's our code word.

01:02.480 --> 01:04.941
No, that's my code word.
Get your own.

01:05.900 --> 01:08.194
Okay. Pretzels.

01:08.653 --> 01:11.239
You hear me say pretzels,
you change the subject.

01:11.531 --> 01:14.951
Rhinos are my least favorite
animals at the zoo.

01:15.368 --> 01:16.619
What?

01:17.704 --> 01:19.581
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we started.

01:21.833 --> 01:24.878
Hey, just hold the gate
still while I screw it in.

01:25.295 --> 01:27.756
You know, I don't know how I feel
about all this baby-proofing.

01:27.839 --> 01:30.216
If Halley can't teach herself
to walk down the stairs,

01:30.341 --> 01:31.885
then maybe that's nature's way
of saying

01:31.968 --> 01:34.512
the Wolowitz line ends here.

01:35.263 --> 01:36.765
That's funny.
I always thought

01:36.848 --> 01:38.266
Howard was nature's way of saying

01:38.349 --> 01:40.226
the Wolowitz line ends here.

01:41.603 --> 01:45.064
Me, too, but life does
find a way!

01:45.940 --> 01:48.401
Hey, Halley can't reach
the liquor cabinet.

01:48.485 --> 01:49.652
Why did you baby-proof it?

01:50.195 --> 01:52.322
How did you know we did?

01:54.240 --> 01:55.992
Fair point.

01:57.452 --> 02:00.747
- Bernadette still going stir-crazy?
- A little.

02:00.872 --> 02:02.874
Two months of bed rest,
it's been rough.

02:02.999 --> 02:05.043
Really? That sounds great.
How do I get that?

02:05.210 --> 02:08.421
You'd either have to break your
hip or let Howard knock you up.

02:09.964 --> 02:12.634
Now, either way, you'll get
flowers the next morning.

02:14.010 --> 02:15.929
She's actually been
keeping herself busy

02:16.012 --> 02:18.223
doing wedding research for you.

02:19.224 --> 02:21.726
Oh! She doesn't have to do that.

02:21.810 --> 02:24.813
She wants to. After all,
you were her maid of honor.

02:27.482 --> 02:30.068
Sheldon, tell your funny story
about pretzels.

02:31.820 --> 02:33.071
Oh. Right. Yeah, yeah.

02:33.154 --> 02:34.656
Did you know that we've been thinking

02:34.781 --> 02:36.950
of having pretzels
at our wedding?

02:37.200 --> 02:38.993
No, no. I'm sorry.

02:39.077 --> 02:41.204
No, rhinos. We're having
rhinos at our wedding.

02:41.287 --> 02:44.290
No! I got to go.

02:49.254 --> 02:51.840
I'm gonna need some help.
Someone baby-proofed the front door.

03:20.326 --> 03:23.121
Sheldon, what am I gonna do
about my maid of honor?

03:23.246 --> 03:25.915
I mean, Bernadette gave me
all these bridal magazines.

03:25.999 --> 03:28.459
She even folded down the pages
with the good dresses.

03:29.878 --> 03:31.379
I get it.
You know, Leonard

03:31.462 --> 03:33.882
once borrowed
my Edmund Scientific catalog

03:33.965 --> 03:35.592
and dog-eared some pages.

03:35.675 --> 03:37.427
Never got 'em straight again.

03:38.761 --> 03:41.014
Well, that is exactly the same thing.

03:41.097 --> 03:43.182
You really understand my dilemma.

03:44.517 --> 03:46.978
Actually, I do.
My mother

03:47.061 --> 03:49.439
is pushing for my brother, Georgie,
to be my best man,

03:49.522 --> 03:51.149
and I hate to disappoint her again.

03:51.232 --> 03:54.652
I already rejected her savior
and her Linkedln invitation.

03:56.321 --> 03:57.989
How are we gonna make these decisions

03:58.072 --> 04:00.074
without anybody getting upset?

04:00.241 --> 04:04.287
Well, what if we take emotion
out of the process,

04:04.370 --> 04:06.956
and base it on empirical metrics?

04:07.040 --> 04:09.751
Then we aren't really
making the decision,

04:09.834 --> 04:11.002
the data is.

04:11.127 --> 04:13.338
So we can hurt our friends' feelings

04:13.421 --> 04:15.715
without taking any responsibility?

04:18.635 --> 04:20.345
Me likey.

04:22.055 --> 04:24.265
But how do we apply
quantitative metrics

04:24.349 --> 04:27.143
to something as subjective
as choosing a wedding party?

04:27.226 --> 04:29.145
That decision only seems subjective.

04:29.228 --> 04:30.438
In reality,

04:30.521 --> 04:33.441
people in a wedding party
perform very specific functions,

04:33.524 --> 04:35.485
and some will perform those
better than others.

04:35.568 --> 04:37.862
If I may use a superhero analogy...

04:37.946 --> 04:40.239
- You may not.
- Okay, I'll use real people.

04:40.323 --> 04:44.243
Um, if a certain dog-like loyalty
is useful,

04:44.327 --> 04:47.622
then it's Leonard.
If having a PEZ dispenser

04:47.705 --> 04:50.959
filled with TUMS is
an advantage, Wolowitz, yeah.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.544
If a best man
with fake testicles hanging

04:53.628 --> 04:54.629
from his truck is important,

04:54.712 --> 04:56.547
well, then, my brother's
back in the running.

04:59.258 --> 05:00.677
Okay, I see your point.

05:00.760 --> 05:03.179
So, we break down
each of the roles

05:03.262 --> 05:04.639
into their component parts,

05:04.722 --> 05:07.392
and then design
specialized tests for each.

05:07.475 --> 05:10.561
Exactly. Boy, if I had known
getting married was going to

05:10.645 --> 05:13.147
involve so much science,
I'd have proposed years ago.

05:16.317 --> 05:18.152
So Leonard, tell everyone your news.

05:19.153 --> 05:21.155
I'm starting a book.

05:21.406 --> 05:22.991
That would be big news from Penny,

05:23.074 --> 05:25.493
but you've read a book before.

05:26.953 --> 05:29.288
He means he's writing a book.

05:29.414 --> 05:32.166
I do. It's something I've been
thinking about for a long time.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.544
Yeah. It's about a brilliant physicist

05:34.627 --> 05:36.546
who solves crimes using science.

05:36.629 --> 05:39.048
- Oh, Leonard...
- It's not about you.

05:41.592 --> 05:44.429
He probably has to say that
for legal reasons.

05:44.679 --> 05:45.680
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

05:46.055 --> 05:48.933
They gave us plain rice
instead of fried rice.

05:49.017 --> 05:51.352
Well, no fair!
I SoulCycled this morning.

05:51.436 --> 05:53.646
I'm entitled to a pile of fat rice.

05:54.981 --> 05:58.860
Well, I would say that this
constitutes a catering crisis.

06:00.028 --> 06:03.281
I agree. Who's gonna
step up and handle it?

06:07.869 --> 06:09.620
Doesn't matter. This is fine.

06:14.542 --> 06:15.626
Penny?

06:15.793 --> 06:17.170
What?

06:18.963 --> 06:20.590
You know what?
I'll take care of it.

06:38.316 --> 06:39.567
Done.

06:39.650 --> 06:41.569
You didn't make him
feel bad, did you?

06:41.778 --> 06:43.488
Actually, he was laughing.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.785
I'm really impressed
at how you handled that, Howard.

06:48.910 --> 06:51.245
Please. I've been sending food
back my entire life.

06:51.329 --> 06:52.705
One of my first
full sentences was,

06:52.789 --> 06:55.249
"I had breast milk for breakfast."

06:58.127 --> 07:00.004
Excuse me,
before we start eating,

07:00.088 --> 07:01.798
I would like to make a toast.

07:01.881 --> 07:02.882
- Nice.
- Nice.

07:02.965 --> 07:04.509
If only I could think of one.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.385
Someone else go.

07:09.347 --> 07:11.182
Hey. Here's the sewing kit
you asked for.

07:11.265 --> 07:13.059
Oh, a minute 19.

07:13.142 --> 07:14.977
Quick.

07:15.770 --> 07:17.271
You were timing me?

07:17.563 --> 07:21.025
Yes. I am going through
a bit of a timing phase.

07:21.901 --> 07:22.985
How long will it last?

07:23.069 --> 07:24.821
We'll find out.

07:25.863 --> 07:27.448
What did you need the kit for?

07:28.658 --> 07:29.659
Oh, er...

07:30.451 --> 07:33.496
Sheldon was squatting down
to pick up a fork

07:33.579 --> 07:35.164
and he ripped his pants.

07:36.249 --> 07:39.252
Someone's gonna be sore tomorrow.

07:41.671 --> 07:42.880
Quick thinking.

07:42.964 --> 07:44.423
But for future lies,

07:44.507 --> 07:46.425
this is as far as I can squat.

07:48.886 --> 07:50.888
Penny gets 20 points
for the sewing kit.

07:50.972 --> 07:52.390
Yeah, minus five,

07:52.473 --> 07:53.933
because this is mine.

07:56.227 --> 07:58.479
Well, she's still pulling
a commanding lead.

07:58.563 --> 08:00.731
Did Bernadette even try
to send us a sewing kit?

08:00.815 --> 08:03.192
She did.
Amazon, standard shipping,

08:03.276 --> 08:04.777
not even Prime.

08:05.319 --> 08:06.696
We could've done that ourselves.

08:06.779 --> 08:09.031
That's what she said.

08:10.324 --> 08:12.201
Maybe we're being old-fashioned,

08:12.285 --> 08:14.245
defining these roles by gender.

08:14.370 --> 08:16.372
You know, historically,
the best man's role

08:16.455 --> 08:18.416
was to defend the bride
and groom in combat.

08:18.499 --> 08:21.085
I mean, if that's not Penny,
I don't know what we're doing here.

08:22.879 --> 08:24.213
I see your point.

08:24.380 --> 08:28.342
Okay, we are officially open
to a best woman

08:28.426 --> 08:30.261
and a gentleman of honor.

08:30.469 --> 08:33.681
Oh! Those names are terrible.
One point off for you.

08:35.349 --> 08:36.893
What am I being tested for?

08:36.976 --> 08:38.769
Oh, it's not important.
But if you don't pass,

08:38.853 --> 08:40.855
none of this matters.

08:42.190 --> 08:44.108
Okay, what's the next test?

08:44.192 --> 08:45.526
Loyalty.

08:45.610 --> 08:47.778
We need to choose
someone who has our backs,

08:48.070 --> 08:51.365
someone who will keep our
secrets even from each other.

08:51.741 --> 08:53.451
Well, I don't have any secrets
from you.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.119
Do you have secrets from me?

08:55.369 --> 08:57.038
Yes.

08:58.664 --> 09:00.374
Oh, that has been weighing
on me for years.

09:00.458 --> 09:02.001
Come here.

09:05.004 --> 09:08.049
Would you call yourself
a loyal and trustworthy friend?

09:08.257 --> 09:10.593
- Yeah, I like to think so.
- Great.

09:10.968 --> 09:13.095
Because I need to tell you
something about Howard,

09:13.221 --> 09:14.972
but you can't tell him
that I told you.

09:15.056 --> 09:16.807
Nope. Don't want to hear it.

09:16.891 --> 09:18.935
Do not like to engage in gossip.

09:19.435 --> 09:22.438
Okay. I respect your integrity.

09:24.190 --> 09:25.191
Is it about his special underwear?

09:25.274 --> 09:27.610
Because I already know.
And that's all I'll say.

09:29.987 --> 09:32.198
Fine, it has a charcoal filter in it.

09:34.575 --> 09:37.078
It's really sweet of you
to come by and keep me company.

09:37.286 --> 09:38.913
Agreed.

09:41.374 --> 09:44.293
So listen, I have a secret

09:44.377 --> 09:46.087
<i>that I need to tell someone.</i>

09:46.462 --> 09:48.547
But you can never say a word.

09:48.631 --> 09:49.799
Not even to Howard.

09:49.882 --> 09:51.801
I'm your girl. Lay it on me.

09:53.010 --> 09:55.680
Really?
You keep things from your husband?

09:56.180 --> 09:57.598
No, I tell him everything.

09:57.682 --> 09:59.433
Don't be a child.

10:00.810 --> 10:03.229
Okay. Here it is.

10:04.188 --> 10:06.023
I can control the thermostat

10:06.107 --> 10:08.609
in Leonard's apartment with my phone.

10:09.318 --> 10:11.737
And when he makes me mad,

10:11.904 --> 10:15.157
I turn it up, slightly.

10:17.493 --> 10:19.912
Oh. Hey. I didn't know you were here.

10:19.996 --> 10:21.622
What are you two talking about?

10:24.041 --> 10:26.294
Literally, nothing interesting.

10:27.962 --> 10:29.797
Oh, you're good.

10:32.258 --> 10:35.678
Okay, getting to
the ceremony on time.

10:36.887 --> 10:38.723
Leonard, quick.
I need you to get me

10:38.806 --> 10:40.099
to Arcadia within the hour.

10:40.182 --> 10:41.517
The train store's having a sale.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.060
Why can't Amy drive you?

10:43.477 --> 10:46.856
Because of the tradition
that I cannot see Amy

10:46.939 --> 10:49.066
on the day of the train store sale.

10:50.568 --> 10:52.987
Please, please see a doctor.

10:54.322 --> 10:56.782
- Next test.
- Just wait one second.

11:01.370 --> 11:03.706
Is it getting hot in here?

11:08.919 --> 11:11.005
I'm sorry. Where were we?

11:11.297 --> 11:14.008
How well do our friends know us?

11:14.967 --> 11:17.053
So I was talking to my favorite aunt...

11:17.136 --> 11:18.763
Aunt Doe, right?

11:19.430 --> 11:20.806
Exactly.

11:21.349 --> 11:23.684
Did she ever figure out what
that thing on her knee was?

11:24.143 --> 11:26.604
Turns out it was a chocolate chip.

11:26.771 --> 11:29.690
Mmm, makes sense, she does like to bake.

11:29.982 --> 11:33.152
Yes, she does. Damn,
you are a thoroughbred.

11:34.737 --> 11:37.448
You know, dealing with cold feet

11:37.531 --> 11:41.702
is an important part of being
both best man and maid of honor.

11:41.952 --> 11:44.288
Maybe we should test for that ability.

11:45.873 --> 11:48.459
You really think
you might get cold feet?

11:49.168 --> 11:51.629
Actually, I was talking about you.

11:51.921 --> 11:53.547
Amy,

11:53.756 --> 11:56.300
if there's one thing in
this world I'm sure of,

11:56.550 --> 11:58.594
you are right to be worried.

12:00.679 --> 12:02.390
Goodnight.

12:06.519 --> 12:10.731
Howard, I've had my eye
on this limited edition Swamp Thing,

12:10.815 --> 12:12.525
but now that I'm
about to buy it,

12:12.608 --> 12:15.194
I'm having second thoughts.
What do you think?

12:16.153 --> 12:18.614
I don't know, Sheldon,
it's pretty expensive.

12:18.948 --> 12:21.992
Yes, but what if it will
make me happy, you know,

12:22.076 --> 12:25.871
waking up and seeing it every
morning for the rest of my life?

12:26.205 --> 12:29.667
Really, a walking clump of swamp grass?

12:30.292 --> 12:32.586
Yeah, well, Bernadette's
no prize either!

12:35.714 --> 12:36.882
Hey, what you doing?

12:36.966 --> 12:40.052
Er, Sheldon gave me a brain-teaser.
It's kind of fun.

12:40.136 --> 12:41.804
It's about a group of people at dinner,

12:41.887 --> 12:44.390
and you have to figure out where
they can sit without fighting.

12:45.641 --> 12:47.601
Yeah, is this
the one where Mr. Green

12:47.685 --> 12:49.562
can't sit next to anyone eating meat,

12:49.645 --> 12:50.896
and Uncle Light Blue

12:50.980 --> 12:53.399
won't sit next to any
of the darker colors?

12:55.693 --> 12:57.486
Yeah, did Sheldon send it to you?

12:57.570 --> 12:59.029
Amy did.
I solved it already.

12:59.196 --> 13:00.281
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:00.364 --> 13:01.991
Same way I solved
my jury duty summons,

13:02.074 --> 13:03.659
I threw it away.

13:04.910 --> 13:05.911
No, no, no, no, no.

13:06.036 --> 13:08.164
Aunt Orange can't sit next to the bar

13:08.247 --> 13:09.540
without Ms. Pink saying,

13:09.707 --> 13:12.084
"Jesus thinks you've
had enough whiskey."

13:14.378 --> 13:16.964
Did Sheldon and Amy give
you guys that puzzle, too?

13:17.173 --> 13:20.342
Yeah. Is it just me or
have they been acting strange?

13:20.468 --> 13:22.678
I don't think they're acting.

13:24.388 --> 13:25.973
Yeah, the other day,
Sheldon made me

13:26.056 --> 13:27.183
take him to the train store.

13:27.266 --> 13:28.559
We didn't go inside.
He just said,

13:28.642 --> 13:30.728
"Nicely done,"
and then we went home.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.023
Yeah, and Amy gave me this plastic ring

13:34.106 --> 13:35.399
and told me to hold on to it.

13:35.483 --> 13:36.525
I got one, too.

13:36.609 --> 13:38.360
- Yeah, same.
- Yeah, me, too.

13:38.694 --> 13:40.613
But Cinnamon ate it.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.909
I'll get it back tomorrow.

13:49.163 --> 13:50.831
I have to say,
this is going pretty well.

13:50.956 --> 13:51.999
It is.

13:52.082 --> 13:55.461
If experimenting on humans
is morally wrong,

13:55.544 --> 13:57.713
then I don't want
to be morally right.

13:59.215 --> 14:00.633
Hey, are you testing us

14:00.716 --> 14:02.593
to see who gets to be in your wedding?

14:02.885 --> 14:04.553
- Yes.
- No.

14:05.387 --> 14:07.306
They're rating us.

14:07.723 --> 14:09.308
And I'm in last?

14:09.892 --> 14:12.186
Don't panic, there's still time.

14:12.269 --> 14:14.730
Look, it's a marathon, not a sprint.

14:16.232 --> 14:17.608
You know what, this is so insulting.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.151
I don't even want to be
your stupid best man.

14:19.235 --> 14:20.486
- Yeah.
- Me neither.

14:20.569 --> 14:21.737
Wait, wait.

14:21.820 --> 14:24.448
Just out of curiosity,
which one of you figured it out?

14:24.782 --> 14:26.367
I did.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.662
Impressive.

14:36.585 --> 14:37.878
Hello, Stuart.

14:37.962 --> 14:41.507
Hey, Sheldon.
Can I interest you in a cappuccino?

14:42.132 --> 14:43.968
When did you start selling those?

14:44.051 --> 14:46.554
Someone left it here,
but it's still warm.

14:48.514 --> 14:50.683
Want to say four bucks?

14:51.976 --> 14:53.018
No, thank you.

14:54.019 --> 14:55.604
Everything okay?

14:56.021 --> 14:59.233
Well, I secretly
experimented on my friends,

14:59.316 --> 15:01.819
and now none of them
want to be my best man.

15:01.944 --> 15:05.281
So, you know,
normal wedding drama.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.366
Sorry.

15:07.449 --> 15:09.535
Probably have to use
my stupid brother.

15:09.868 --> 15:12.371
So get ready for a wedding toast
delivered by his armpit.

15:13.455 --> 15:15.165
Well, if you really don't
want to use your brother,

15:15.249 --> 15:16.667
I'd be your best man.

15:18.168 --> 15:21.505
- Really?
- Yeah, we're friends.

15:21.589 --> 15:22.965
Plus, it'd be nice.

15:23.048 --> 15:25.884
Never really been called
the best before.

15:27.469 --> 15:29.597
Or a man, for that matter.

15:30.973 --> 15:33.392
Okay, well, thank you, Stuart.

15:33.475 --> 15:34.893
That's a very generous offer.

15:34.977 --> 15:36.520
My pleasure.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.022
I understand

15:38.105 --> 15:40.983
the best man usually
receives a present.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.819
That's true.

15:44.903 --> 15:47.072
Can never have
too much Claritin.

15:51.493 --> 15:54.538
You're still working on
Sheldon's dumb brain-teaser?

15:54.622 --> 15:58.208
Oh, my God, Dr. Purple's
a woman! Of course!

15:58.834 --> 16:01.378
Oh, that feels so good.

16:02.212 --> 16:03.464
Hello.

16:03.589 --> 16:06.884
I believe I owe the
three of you an apology.

16:08.218 --> 16:10.054
No argument here.

16:11.263 --> 16:13.182
By experimenting on you,

16:13.265 --> 16:15.809
I realize I've violated your trust

16:16.018 --> 16:19.605
and possibly the Geneva Convention.

16:20.606 --> 16:21.815
Is that it?

16:21.899 --> 16:22.983
No.

16:23.067 --> 16:25.319
So as to not upset
any of you further,

16:25.402 --> 16:27.571
I've asked Stuart
to be my best man,

16:27.655 --> 16:28.864
and he's agreed.

16:29.031 --> 16:31.075
Now, you're all still invited
to the bachelor party.

16:31.158 --> 16:34.453
He's thinking Costco
and the theme is browsing.

16:35.913 --> 16:37.956
You picked Stuart over one of us?

16:38.040 --> 16:39.291
Well, I wanted to choose one of you,

16:39.375 --> 16:40.918
but you all turned against me.

16:41.293 --> 16:45.047
Picking a best man isn't
about keeping score.

16:45.297 --> 16:46.840
But you're all my friends.

16:46.965 --> 16:48.550
I mean, if I didn't collect data,

16:48.634 --> 16:51.178
how could I possibly choose
among the three of you?

16:51.553 --> 16:53.806
Well, that's actually kind of sweet.

16:54.098 --> 16:57.101
Is it?
Then perhaps I said it wrong.

16:58.060 --> 17:01.271
Look, this is your wedding,
just pick whoever you want.

17:01.355 --> 17:03.399
You don't need to worry
about anyone else but yourself.

17:03.482 --> 17:06.360
You've kind of been training
for this your whole life.

17:07.528 --> 17:08.904
Thank you, Leonard.

17:09.446 --> 17:11.824
And if it helps,
these two are quitters.

17:16.286 --> 17:17.413
Hey, what you making?

17:17.496 --> 17:19.331
Er. Well, I spilled the cheese packet,

17:19.415 --> 17:22.251
so we're having mac and nothing.

17:23.293 --> 17:26.171
Yeah. I'll just have the mac.
"Nothing" gives me gas.

17:30.008 --> 17:31.510
Why are you in such a good mood?

17:31.677 --> 17:32.803
I just talked to Sheldon.

17:32.886 --> 17:36.181
He apologized about the tests
and asked me to be his best man.

17:36.640 --> 17:39.476
Great. After all you've done
for him, he should've asked you.

17:39.560 --> 17:40.853
And Amy's your best friend.

17:40.936 --> 17:42.980
I'm sure she'll come
to her senses and pick you.

17:43.105 --> 17:45.065
Okay, she's not my best friend.
We're not 12.

17:45.149 --> 17:46.734
If she wants Bernadette
to be her maid of honor,

17:46.817 --> 17:47.943
I really don't care.

17:48.110 --> 17:49.236
Sounds like you care.

17:49.319 --> 17:51.113
No, I mean, it's just annoying.

17:51.196 --> 17:53.365
You know, we talk every day.
We see each other all the time.

17:53.449 --> 17:55.242
She's always there
for me, and basically...

17:55.325 --> 17:57.369
Oh, my God,
Amy's my best friend.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.623
You okay?

18:01.832 --> 18:04.418
No, my best friend didn't ask me
to be her maid of honor.

18:04.501 --> 18:05.961
I'm pissed!

18:08.839 --> 18:13.010
So, bottom line,
what you did was wrong and cruel,

18:13.218 --> 18:16.722
which the mother of my children
finds oddly appealing.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.434
So she still wants
to be my maid of honor?

18:20.517 --> 18:21.810
Maid of honor, hit woman,
whatever you need.

18:21.894 --> 18:23.812
Make the call.

18:25.481 --> 18:27.065
Look, I know this is your wedding,

18:27.149 --> 18:28.150
and you can do whatever you want,

18:28.233 --> 18:30.527
but if you think anyone but me
is gonna be your maid of honor,

18:30.611 --> 18:33.280
then you're an idiot because
you are my best friend.

18:33.530 --> 18:35.699
- Too late. Bernadette...
- Bestie!

18:45.334 --> 18:46.710
Stuart, I'm sorry if it's weird

18:46.794 --> 18:49.004
Sheldon made me best man
instead of you.

18:49.296 --> 18:52.466
It's okay.
I was best man for two whole days.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.721
No one can take that away from me.

18:58.931 --> 19:01.308
Except for Sheldon, when he did.

19:03.060 --> 19:05.312
Although, if you want to be
a part of the wedding party,

19:05.395 --> 19:07.689
I suppose you could be the flower girl.

19:10.275 --> 19:11.568
Sold.

19:13.403 --> 19:15.864
Well, I thought Halley
was gonna be the flower girl.

19:16.114 --> 19:18.659
Oh. That's much better.
Sorry, Stuart, you're out.

19:21.203 --> 19:23.747
Hey, so is Bernadette okay
with me being maid of honor?

19:23.831 --> 19:26.750
Actually, I haven't
had the courage to tell her.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.003
- I guess I should do that.
- Yeah.

19:33.215 --> 19:34.800
Although, as maid of honor,

19:34.883 --> 19:37.094
your job is to make my life easier.

19:38.679 --> 19:39.847
Damn it.

19:39.930 --> 19:42.432
Hey, Stuart, you still
want in on this wedding?

19:45.853 --> 19:47.646
Not that much.

19:48.564 --> 19:51.024
Fine, I'll do it.

19:51.441 --> 19:54.486
But do me a favor and unlock
the liquor cabinet first.

20:21.221 --> 20:22.222
English - SDH
