WEBVTT

00:03.505 --> 00:04.756
Can we start the movie?

00:05.298 --> 00:06.925
Before Sheldon gets here?

00:07.008 --> 00:09.594
Last time we did that, he didn't
talk to us for a month.

00:10.428 --> 00:11.680
So do it!

00:12.472 --> 00:13.932
Hold on. Where is he?

00:14.015 --> 00:17.143
Well, according to his text,
he was on the second floor,

00:17.268 --> 00:18.770
then he stopped
to tie his shoe.

00:21.981 --> 00:23.566
"All tied, and..."

00:24.067 --> 00:25.443
- Hello!
- Hi.

00:25.819 --> 00:28.905
Sorry we're late.
Amy took forever tying my shoe.

00:30.782 --> 00:34.035
All right!
Who's excited to see a documentary?

00:34.119 --> 00:36.079
Oh, I know this one.
Nobody ever.

00:36.162 --> 00:38.248
Hey! This one's
going to be great.

00:38.331 --> 00:39.582
This is about the rivalry

00:39.666 --> 00:42.210
between a cool renegade
scientist, Nikola Tesla,

00:42.293 --> 00:44.170
and his arch-nemesis,
Thomas Edison.

00:44.254 --> 00:46.506
And it's the greatest
scientific feud of all time.

00:46.589 --> 00:49.342
I mean, you can forget
about Leibniz and Newton.

00:49.509 --> 00:50.552
Done.

00:50.635 --> 00:54.222
So, Tesla's the one
that invented the electric car?

00:56.182 --> 00:59.811
No, Penny.
No, the car is just named after him.

01:00.103 --> 01:01.730
Okay, you don't have to be
so smug about it.

01:01.813 --> 01:03.064
You know, you went
to see the movie <i>It</i>

01:03.148 --> 01:05.775
because you thought
it was about scary I.T. guys.

01:08.695 --> 01:11.406
Tesla was a genius who
invented our electrical grid.

01:11.489 --> 01:13.324
Edison just wanted to
get rich and famous.

01:13.408 --> 01:14.909
Didn't he invent the light bulb?

01:15.076 --> 01:16.202
Mmm, that's what
he wants you to think.

01:16.286 --> 01:18.788
But without the foundational
work of Ebenezer Kinnersley,

01:18.872 --> 01:21.291
Warren de la Rue
and James Bowman Lindsay,

01:21.374 --> 01:23.418
you wouldn't know Edison
any more than you know

01:23.501 --> 01:26.671
Ebenezer Kinnersley, Warren de la Rue
or James Bowman Lindsay.

01:27.297 --> 01:29.924
Isn't he sexy all fired up?

01:30.800 --> 01:34.053
He really gets my current alternating,
if you know what I mean.

01:35.096 --> 01:37.682
Edison was kind of a
publicity hog and a bully.

01:37.766 --> 01:39.851
Yeah, he electrocuted
an elephant named Topsy

01:39.934 --> 01:41.603
just to make himself famous.

01:41.686 --> 01:44.105
If I had an elephant named Topsy,
he would want for nothing.

01:45.440 --> 01:47.233
Also, he'd be named Jumbo.

01:48.234 --> 01:51.696
And worse than that, Edison
filmed the first on-screen kiss,

01:51.821 --> 01:54.157
so he's basically
a pornographer.

01:55.742 --> 01:57.494
Although every time
I put that in Wikipedia,

01:57.577 --> 01:59.412
someone takes it out.

02:01.372 --> 02:03.416
Is your current still alternating?

02:03.500 --> 02:05.835
We're lucky there aren't
any elephants in here.

02:34.489 --> 02:36.241
You know, that documentary
last night was actually

02:36.324 --> 02:37.826
better than I
thought it would be.

02:37.909 --> 02:38.952
Really?

02:39.035 --> 02:40.328
Should've been about
Samuel Morse

02:40.411 --> 02:42.455
the way they telegraphed
that ending.

02:43.206 --> 02:45.124
You know, I already pretended to laugh
at that joke once.

02:45.208 --> 02:46.751
Do I have to do it again?

02:47.877 --> 02:49.587
Yeah, I'd appreciate it.

02:49.671 --> 02:53.341
Samuel Morse. You kill me.

02:55.760 --> 02:57.595
Leonard, can you
drive me to work?

02:57.679 --> 02:59.222
Yeah, sure.
Hey, the guys and I

02:59.305 --> 03:01.057
were talking about
going to see the Tesla coil

03:01.140 --> 03:03.810
at the observatory later on,
if you want to join.

03:03.977 --> 03:05.562
Oh, I'm sorry, I can't.
I'm busy.

03:05.979 --> 03:07.897
- Why? What are you doing?
- Leonard, what are you doing?

03:07.981 --> 03:10.358
He said he can't go.
Make a sad face, move on.

03:12.068 --> 03:15.154
It's fine.
I couldn't tell you even if I wanted to.

03:15.238 --> 03:16.281
- What does that mean?
- Leonard!

03:16.364 --> 03:18.575
Sad face, sad face.

03:19.242 --> 03:21.494
I mean, I would like to,
but I just can't, you know,

03:21.578 --> 03:23.705
because it's classified
and top secret.

03:24.664 --> 03:26.541
Hold on, are you still
working for the military?

03:26.624 --> 03:27.625
I'm so glad
you figured that out!

03:27.709 --> 03:29.335
It was killing me
keeping it a secret!

03:30.336 --> 03:31.796
I thought they fired you guys.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.840
They did,
but then they hired me back.

03:34.090 --> 03:35.884
Well, you better not be
working on our project,

03:35.967 --> 03:37.010
because we're a team.

03:37.093 --> 03:40.263
Leonard, there is
no "I" in team.

03:40.597 --> 03:41.890
However, there is an "I" in

03:41.973 --> 03:44.183
"I'm working with the military
and you're not."

03:45.310 --> 03:47.520
There's five of them, in fact.

03:51.941 --> 03:54.277
Hey, hey.
I got a big surprise for you.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.279
Is it pie and ice cream?

03:57.780 --> 03:59.240
Wow, did I oversell it.

03:59.324 --> 04:00.909
It's Raj and Ruchi!

04:01.868 --> 04:03.745
- Hello.
- Hey. Hi.

04:03.828 --> 04:05.371
Hey, what are
you two doing here?

04:05.455 --> 04:07.707
We won't stay long.
I just wanted to drop something off

04:07.790 --> 04:09.709
from me and the girls at work.

04:09.792 --> 04:12.337
None of the girls at work
like me enough to get me a gift.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.339
Okay, so you'll know
why everyone at the office

04:14.422 --> 04:15.882
has the same handwriting.

04:17.342 --> 04:18.509
I really appreciate the thought,

04:18.593 --> 04:20.887
but it's not necessary.
I'll be back soon.

04:20.970 --> 04:23.681
Don't worry about work.
You take all the time you need.

04:23.765 --> 04:25.433
Yeah, just turn off your brain

04:25.516 --> 04:27.894
and let your uterus do its magic.

04:30.021 --> 04:32.065
It's the star of the show now.

04:33.399 --> 04:35.818
Okay, wasn't sure how long
I should let you guys stay.

04:35.902 --> 04:38.363
Now I know! Get out!

04:38.863 --> 04:40.490
Good to see you. You look amazing.

04:40.573 --> 04:42.450
Thanks for coming!

04:43.618 --> 04:45.286
That bitch.

04:47.246 --> 04:50.917
Come on, he means well. He's just trying
to impress his girlfriend.

04:51.793 --> 04:54.879
I'm talking about Ruchi.
She's after my job.

04:54.963 --> 04:57.840
Why do you think she said,
"Take all the time you need?"

04:58.383 --> 05:00.426
Because she was being nice?

05:00.510 --> 05:03.513
No, she's trying to steal
my projects while I'm at home

05:03.596 --> 05:06.391
taking care of this useless
plant and my dumb family.

05:08.851 --> 05:10.895
I'm only saying this
because I love you

05:10.979 --> 05:13.147
and because you can't
reach me from that bed,

05:13.231 --> 05:15.316
but you sound a little crazy.

05:16.401 --> 05:18.611
I love you, too, but I could
fling this card in your eye

05:18.695 --> 05:20.571
like a ninja throwing star.

05:21.990 --> 05:23.783
I don't believe you.

05:29.205 --> 05:31.457
Why would the military want Sheldon?

05:31.666 --> 05:33.751
I don't know. Target practice?

05:35.336 --> 05:37.880
Well, he better not be
working on our guidance system.

05:37.964 --> 05:39.132
That was my idea.

05:39.215 --> 05:42.176
Why don't we call Colonel Williams
and find out what's going on.

05:42.260 --> 05:45.263
Great. I want answers,
and he'd better give them to us.

05:47.890 --> 05:51.269
<i>- Hello, gentlemen.</i>
- Hi, sir. Leonard has a question.

05:54.188 --> 05:57.108
Hey, is Sheldon working on
our project again?

05:57.358 --> 05:59.902
<i>- Did he say that?</i>
- No, he wouldn't tell us.

05:59.986 --> 06:01.029
<i>Oh.</i>

06:01.112 --> 06:03.322
<i>So he can
keep his mouth shut.</i>

06:04.699 --> 06:06.701
<i>How do I get him to do that?</i>

06:07.493 --> 06:10.371
Is he working on
our guidance system or not?

06:10.455 --> 06:13.499
<i>Dr. Cooper contacted us
with an idea on how to modify</i>

06:13.583 --> 06:16.044
<i>your technology into
a communication system,</i>

06:16.127 --> 06:17.462
<i>and it seemed interesting.</i>

06:18.004 --> 06:21.049
But our team developed
that technology.

06:21.132 --> 06:22.508
<i>And he was your team leader.</i>

06:22.592 --> 06:24.177
Well, who said
he was team leader?

06:24.385 --> 06:25.470
<i>He did.</i>

06:26.721 --> 06:29.307
<i>And I like that kind of
"take charge" attitude.</i>

06:29.390 --> 06:31.476
We can have "take charge" attitudes.

06:31.559 --> 06:34.020
<i>Then why didn't either of you
ask to be team leader?</i>

06:34.103 --> 06:36.439
We didn't want to step
on anyone's toes.

06:37.690 --> 06:40.485
Yeah, so we were just waiting for you to
tell us who you thought...

06:40.568 --> 06:42.320
Okay, I hear it.

06:44.864 --> 06:46.324
<i>- Are we done?
- No, no.</i>

06:46.407 --> 06:49.077
I am taking charge right now
and telling you

06:49.160 --> 06:50.995
that it is not okay
with us if...

06:51.079 --> 06:52.371
Okay, bye.

06:56.584 --> 06:58.878
Hey. I just got your text.
Everything okay?

06:59.337 --> 07:01.631
Yeah, there's just something
I need to ask you.

07:01.756 --> 07:06.636
- Oh, Bernie, I'd be thrilled.
- It's not be my birth coach.

07:07.595 --> 07:10.723
Okay, that hurts, but luckily I
know how to breathe through it.

07:15.019 --> 07:17.146
I need you to find out
if Ruchi's trying to steal

07:17.230 --> 07:19.273
my projects at work
while I'm on bed rest.

07:19.357 --> 07:21.984
Come on, she's not that
kind of a person.

07:22.068 --> 07:24.570
She's generous and charitable.

07:24.862 --> 07:26.823
You're just saying that
'cause she's sleeping with you.

07:26.948 --> 07:28.825
Yes, that's my favorite charity.

07:30.785 --> 07:34.372
I know I sound paranoid,
but I'm feeling really vulnerable.

07:34.455 --> 07:36.749
If there's anything you could
find out, it'd be great.

07:37.416 --> 07:40.628
And if she is up to anything,
what are you gonna do?

07:41.212 --> 07:42.255
Nothing.

07:42.380 --> 07:44.006
I'll just calmly
talk to her and explain

07:44.090 --> 07:46.509
there are certain boundaries
that need to be respected.

07:46.592 --> 07:50.012
It's really for the benefit
of everyone at the company.

07:52.140 --> 07:55.643
Ah. Okay, what you're saying
sounds nice,

07:55.726 --> 07:57.228
but the way you're saying it

07:57.311 --> 08:00.648
is causing my testicles
to take cover in my abdomen.

08:03.818 --> 08:05.278
What do you want to watch?

08:05.570 --> 08:06.821
Oh, why don't you pick?

08:06.988 --> 08:08.781
Okay, how about comedy?

08:09.115 --> 08:11.576
Eh, I already laughed today.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.871
I know. It was when I stubbed my toe.

08:15.872 --> 08:17.623
Still funny.

08:18.958 --> 08:19.959
Drama?

08:20.042 --> 08:21.878
Nah, I've already seen
someone cry today.

08:21.961 --> 08:23.671
It really hurt, Sheldon!

08:26.674 --> 08:28.718
Hey. We talked to Colonel Williams.

08:28.801 --> 08:29.802
He told us everything.

08:29.886 --> 08:31.429
I'm sorry, can we do this
another time?

08:31.512 --> 08:34.932
Amy's just about to realize she
wants to watch a Hulk marathon.

08:36.058 --> 08:37.059
What's going on?

08:37.143 --> 08:39.937
Sheldon went to the Air Force
behind our backs.

08:40.021 --> 08:41.564
I did nothing of the sort.

08:41.731 --> 08:43.024
I had an idea

08:43.107 --> 08:45.193
for a neutrino-based
communication system,

08:45.276 --> 08:47.361
I presented it to them,
and they were interested.

08:47.445 --> 08:49.280
But your communication system

08:49.363 --> 08:51.365
was based on our guidance system.

08:51.824 --> 08:53.618
And sonar is based on bats.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.119
You don't see them
hanging upside down

08:55.203 --> 08:57.246
in a patent attorney's office.

08:58.039 --> 09:00.583
You know what, you like to think
that you're just like Tesla,

09:00.666 --> 09:02.960
but the truth is
you're exactly like Edison.

09:03.544 --> 09:06.214
- You take that back.
- No, he's right.

09:06.297 --> 09:09.967
You are a bully, a credit hog
and a self-promoter.

09:10.051 --> 09:14.805
And if anyone around here
is like Tesla, it's us.

09:16.807 --> 09:18.726
Yeah.

09:21.729 --> 09:24.440
Can you believe they said
I was just like Edison?

09:24.523 --> 09:27.151
Yeah, and in front of a lady, no less.

09:27.276 --> 09:29.320
Well, you are
building on their work

09:29.487 --> 09:30.905
and taking the credit for it.

09:30.988 --> 09:32.615
That's a classic Edison move.

09:33.157 --> 09:34.158
Oh, yeah?

09:34.242 --> 09:36.369
Well, if I'm Edison
and you love me,

09:36.452 --> 09:38.037
then what does that say
about you?

09:38.704 --> 09:41.958
- I honestly don't know.
- Okay.

09:42.041 --> 09:44.293
Well, I have to Google
some stuff about Mrs. Edison.

09:44.377 --> 09:46.545
I'll be right back.

09:51.676 --> 09:52.969
You know whose fault this is?

09:53.052 --> 09:55.221
I do. Yours.

09:55.638 --> 09:57.765
No, my mother's.

09:57.848 --> 09:59.850
"Go make friends, Sheldon."

10:01.560 --> 10:04.105
What happens?
Twenty years later, they call me names.

10:05.773 --> 10:08.192
I don't think what they
called you is the point here.

10:08.276 --> 10:10.027
Oh, yeah? How would you feel

10:10.236 --> 10:13.281
if I called you the name of a
neuroscientist you didn't like?

10:13.572 --> 10:15.825
Do you know the name
of any neuroscientist?

10:16.242 --> 10:17.285
Of course.

10:17.618 --> 10:18.619
Not me?

10:20.162 --> 10:21.414
Then no.

10:23.457 --> 10:24.917
Do you think they're right, Amy?

10:26.669 --> 10:28.504
Do you think I'm like Edison?

10:30.339 --> 10:32.591
Sheldon, I don't think you're upset

10:32.675 --> 10:35.761
because of what kind of
scientist they said you're like.

10:35.886 --> 10:39.348
I think you're upset because
your friends' feelings got hurt.

10:40.850 --> 10:42.685
You're right.

10:42.768 --> 10:45.187
I care too much about
other people's feelings.

10:47.231 --> 10:49.650
It's always been my fatal flaw.

10:51.444 --> 10:52.445
Sheldon, I don't think...

10:52.528 --> 10:55.072
No, no, not now, Amy.
I'm growing as a person.

10:58.784 --> 11:00.619
That was fun.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.580
Put her there, buddy.

11:04.081 --> 11:06.625
I am not fist bumping
you after we have sex.

11:06.917 --> 11:09.337
You're the one who wanted
to keep things casual.

11:09.420 --> 11:11.922
There's a difference
between casual and weird.

11:12.214 --> 11:13.924
Not the way I do it.

11:16.761 --> 11:19.513
So, how was your day?

11:19.597 --> 11:21.724
Like, how's work?

11:22.350 --> 11:24.727
Oh, great. With Bernadette gone,

11:24.810 --> 11:26.979
I'm getting to handle all her projects.

11:27.271 --> 11:30.149
Well, she's not gone.
She'll be back soon.

11:30.941 --> 11:33.152
Not too soon, let's hope.

11:35.112 --> 11:37.156
So it turns out Ruchi is totally

11:37.239 --> 11:38.866
trying to take over
Bernadette's projects.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.951
Wow, she just told you
that out of the blue?

11:41.035 --> 11:42.745
Yeah, yeah,
we had just made love.

11:42.828 --> 11:44.497
It was so beautiful.

11:45.831 --> 11:47.249
Our caramel-colored bodies

11:47.333 --> 11:49.001
were entwined like erotic taffy...

11:49.085 --> 11:50.836
Get to the point!

11:52.171 --> 11:53.172
Sorry, yeah.

11:53.255 --> 11:55.591
I asked her about work,
and she just admitted

11:55.674 --> 11:57.635
she has her eyes
on Bernadette's projects.

11:57.843 --> 11:58.928
Can't believe she
would take advantage

11:59.011 --> 12:01.305
of a pregnant lady like that.
So what did you do?

12:01.389 --> 12:02.765
What do you think I did?

12:02.848 --> 12:05.726
I made small talk for 20 minutes
and had sex again.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.312
You have to say
something to Bernie.

12:08.396 --> 12:10.815
I don't know. If I do that,
she's gonna confront Ruchi,

12:10.898 --> 12:12.650
and then Ruchi's gonna
stop sleeping with me.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.360
Raj, you can't go on
sleeping with a woman

12:14.443 --> 12:16.153
who's trying to screw
over your friend.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.948
Can't or must?

12:22.034 --> 12:23.869
You know, that guidance system
was my idea.

12:23.953 --> 12:25.162
You figured out how to make it work.

12:25.246 --> 12:26.539
We didn't even need Sheldon.

12:26.831 --> 12:29.583
Let's not forget your idea
was based on my theory.

12:29.667 --> 12:32.878
Hey, we're bagging
on Sheldon here! Focus!

12:34.797 --> 12:37.216
I guess it was pretty smart
using our quantum technology

12:37.299 --> 12:39.218
as the basis for
a communication system.

12:39.468 --> 12:42.179
Be even better if he swapped out
the helium for xenon.

12:42.721 --> 12:46.016
Ooh, so instead of having to
keep it at negative 271 degrees,

12:46.100 --> 12:48.102
you'd only have to keep it
at negative 108.

12:48.185 --> 12:49.478
It would be way more efficient.

12:49.562 --> 12:51.605
And xenon has a bigger nucleus,

12:51.689 --> 12:54.275
so coherence would make it
an easier signal to see.

12:54.483 --> 12:55.609
You're brilliant!

12:55.693 --> 12:57.945
- We should tell Sheldon.
- You're an idiot!

12:59.071 --> 13:00.239
We don't tell Sheldon.

13:00.322 --> 13:01.782
We go to the military
behind his back

13:01.866 --> 13:03.617
and we screw him
like he screwed us.

13:03.701 --> 13:05.244
Yeah, yeah. All right, you're right,
you're right, we don't need him.

13:05.327 --> 13:06.412
We can do this all on our own.

13:06.537 --> 13:07.538
Do you think
you can do the math?

13:07.621 --> 13:08.873
No.

13:10.708 --> 13:11.792
But if someone else does it,

13:11.876 --> 13:13.919
I can double check
the crap out of it.

13:16.922 --> 13:19.467
I want you to know,
I did what you asked.

13:19.675 --> 13:22.511
I talked to Ruchi and found out
what's going on at work.

13:22.595 --> 13:24.472
So, is she trying
to steal my projects?

13:24.555 --> 13:26.223
No, not trying to,
sounds like it's a done deal.

13:26.307 --> 13:27.391
Here, have a brownie.

13:29.185 --> 13:31.770
- I'm gonna kill her.
- Okay, don't take this out on Ruchi.

13:32.146 --> 13:33.856
Is she trying to take your job? Yes.

13:33.939 --> 13:35.691
Is she parking in your space? Yes.

13:35.774 --> 13:37.234
Did she get a laugh
at a meeting yesterday

13:37.318 --> 13:39.403
by calling you "Pregnadette"?
Big one.

13:41.155 --> 13:44.366
But you would've done the exact
same thing and you know it.

13:44.575 --> 13:46.368
I never would've
undermined a coworker.

13:46.452 --> 13:49.371
What? Oh, please.
What about that guy Eric

13:49.455 --> 13:51.707
who you told it was
"Bring Your Cat to Work Day"

13:51.790 --> 13:54.418
when you knew
your boss had asthma?

13:55.377 --> 13:56.879
That was just a hilarious prank

13:56.962 --> 13:59.089
that ended with me
getting a corner office.

14:01.050 --> 14:02.176
All I'm saying is

14:02.259 --> 14:04.428
before you attack Ruchi,
maybe you should

14:04.512 --> 14:05.888
take a long hard look
in the mirror,

14:05.971 --> 14:07.181
because you know what you'll see,

14:07.306 --> 14:10.142
apart from radiant skin
and luxuriously thick hair?

14:10.226 --> 14:11.727
Hypocrisy!

14:17.233 --> 14:18.817
It is thick.

14:21.445 --> 14:23.447
So what do you think?
Can you make it work?

14:23.531 --> 14:25.658
Uh, I just need to use the cross section

14:25.741 --> 14:28.118
to calculate the probability
of the interaction.

14:28.661 --> 14:29.703
Can we help?

14:29.787 --> 14:31.038
Yes.

14:31.121 --> 14:33.374
Why don't you run
get me a can of Pringles.

14:36.085 --> 14:37.253
Leonard, I was...

14:37.920 --> 14:39.338
What's Kripke doing here?

14:39.421 --> 14:41.715
He's just helping us
develop a better, more efficient

14:41.799 --> 14:44.009
neutrino comm system that we're
gonna pitch to the military,

14:44.093 --> 14:45.177
making yours obsolete.

14:45.261 --> 14:46.262
Yeah, Leonard thought of it.

14:46.345 --> 14:47.596
- It's genius.
- Thanks.

14:47.680 --> 14:49.265
You see, instead of
using liquid helium...

14:49.348 --> 14:51.559
- Good God, man, shut up!
- Right, sorry.

14:52.351 --> 14:53.727
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:53.811 --> 14:56.939
You didn't tell me we were doing this
just to stick it to Sheldon.

14:57.022 --> 14:59.275
- Oh, well...
- I'm messing with you.

14:59.358 --> 15:01.652
This sundae just got a cherry on top!

15:04.029 --> 15:05.906
Fine. Good luck to you.

15:05.990 --> 15:08.325
The military is already
interested in my system,

15:08.409 --> 15:09.660
and my math is worked out.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.328
His still has a big gap in it.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.289
Where?

15:14.707 --> 15:15.833
- There.
- What?

15:19.628 --> 15:21.463
- Can I ask you a question?
- Hmm?

15:21.880 --> 15:23.882
Does a drug still count
as an antidepressant

15:23.966 --> 15:27.344
if its number one side effect
is uncontrollable weeping?

15:29.013 --> 15:32.057
I don't know. I always feel
better after a good cry.

15:33.017 --> 15:36.312
I've been trying to ask Bernadette,
but she's not answering any of my texts.

15:36.562 --> 15:38.981
Yeah, listen, I think she might be

15:39.064 --> 15:40.816
a little threatened by you, you know,

15:40.899 --> 15:43.319
because you can tie your own
shoes and laugh without peeing.

15:44.862 --> 15:46.155
Did she say something to you?

15:46.238 --> 15:47.573
No.

15:47.656 --> 15:49.283
I mean, well, kind of.

15:49.366 --> 15:51.243
But it's okay. She's just hormonal.

15:51.327 --> 15:52.995
And, you know, don't worry,
I stood up for you.

15:53.746 --> 15:55.497
I don't need you to stand up for me.

15:55.581 --> 15:56.874
You're not my boyfriend.

15:57.333 --> 15:59.043
Look, I care about you,

15:59.126 --> 16:01.629
and you can say that
this doesn't mean anything,

16:01.712 --> 16:03.839
but the truth is we're in
a relationship, okay?

16:03.922 --> 16:06.592
And you're gonna have to figure
out some way to deal with it.

16:07.760 --> 16:10.137
I can't believe she dumped me.

16:11.347 --> 16:13.891
This is tough for me, 'cause I can.

16:18.854 --> 16:21.440
Sorry things worked out like that.

16:21.732 --> 16:24.526
Because I'm in pain or because
you don't have a spy anymore?

16:25.110 --> 16:26.528
Let's just leave it at, "I'm sorry."

16:26.612 --> 16:27.696
You're already sad.

16:31.492 --> 16:34.411
Based on Kripke's calculations,
I think this is gonna work.

16:34.495 --> 16:36.330
Maybe we should pitch it
to Colonel Williams today.

16:36.538 --> 16:38.540
Why limit ourselves
to the U.S. Military?

16:38.624 --> 16:41.168
I bet there's a lot of
other places we could take this.

16:41.627 --> 16:43.379
Without committing criminal espionage?

16:43.462 --> 16:45.631
You know, it's easy
to shoot an idea down, Leonard.

16:47.883 --> 16:50.886
Well, I suppose
congratulations are in order.

16:50.969 --> 16:53.889
You set out to destroy me,
and you achieved your goal.

16:53.972 --> 16:55.015
What are you talking about?

16:55.099 --> 16:58.352
The military canceled my project,
because they're going with yours.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.730
That's impossible.
We haven't even pitched it yet.

17:01.814 --> 17:03.899
Well, Colonel Williams said
another team at Caltech

17:03.982 --> 17:06.110
came up with a more efficient
neutrino comm system.

17:06.193 --> 17:07.403
Damn it!

17:09.196 --> 17:10.864
Excuse us.

17:11.782 --> 17:12.866
Kripke.

17:13.951 --> 17:16.161
- What's up, fellas?
- Did you screw us over?

17:16.412 --> 17:19.331
Ooh, I can't tell you that.
It's classified.

17:26.714 --> 17:28.966
Why did you tell
Barry Kripke your idea?

17:29.049 --> 17:30.259
This is all your fault.

17:30.342 --> 17:31.760
No, it's your fault.

17:31.844 --> 17:33.178
If you would've come to us
in the beginning,

17:33.262 --> 17:34.471
none of this would've happened.

17:34.555 --> 17:36.598
Well, if it helps,
you all behaved terribly

17:36.682 --> 17:38.225
and you deserve what you got.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.227
Well, that doesn't help at all.

17:41.437 --> 17:43.981
You know, sometimes your
social skills are very poor.

17:46.233 --> 17:49.236
I can't believe we let
Kripke use us like that.

17:49.319 --> 17:51.488
You know, maybe you're all
more like the guy

17:51.572 --> 17:53.949
who didn't invent the electric car

17:54.032 --> 17:57.411
and less like the guy
who didn't invent the light bulb.

18:02.082 --> 18:05.127
She's right. Maybe we're all
a bunch of Teslas after all.

18:06.170 --> 18:09.423
Didn't Tesla die penniless,
forgotten and insane?

18:09.506 --> 18:12.468
You may have a point
about her social skills.

18:13.886 --> 18:15.179
He wasn't insane.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.055
He did fall in love with a pigeon.

18:17.222 --> 18:18.974
Well, if we're gonna
call Tesla crazy

18:19.057 --> 18:20.809
for loving something
small and unappealing,

18:20.893 --> 18:23.187
might as well put Penny
in a padded cell right now.

18:54.092 --> 18:55.344
English - SDH
