00:03.755 --> 00:07.592
If Bruce Banner is driving
a rental car and turns into the Hulk,

00:07.676 --> 00:08.760
do you think he's covered or

00:08.843 --> 00:11.638
does he need to
add the Hulk as an additional driver?

00:13.515 --> 00:15.100
You really need a girlfriend.

00:17.769 --> 00:19.145
Mailman's here!

00:20.647 --> 00:23.441
Aw. Remember when he used to
get that excited to see us?

00:24.693 --> 00:27.028
Do you have any mail
for Doctor Sheldon Cooper?

00:27.112 --> 00:30.990
I do, but I can't hand it right to you,
I have to put it in the box.

00:31.074 --> 00:33.284
And that is what
separates the U.S. Postal Service

00:33.368 --> 00:34.828
from those hippies at FedEx.

00:37.372 --> 00:38.581
Oh, goody.

00:40.375 --> 00:41.751
What is so exciting?

00:41.835 --> 00:43.753
It's a letter from Doctor Wolcott.

00:43.837 --> 00:46.464
We've been corresponding
about my string theory research.

00:46.548 --> 00:50.593
Wait, Robert Wolcott?
Like Wolcott's Theorem, Wolcott?

00:50.719 --> 00:52.011
The very same.

00:52.387 --> 00:55.140
Didn't he go crazy
and cut off all contact with people?

00:55.598 --> 00:58.017
Yeah, he was driven mad
by a friend

00:58.101 --> 01:00.812
who kept wanting to
talk about the Hulk's car insurance.

01:03.356 --> 01:05.567
Oh, he's invited me
to his cabin for the weekend

01:05.650 --> 01:07.152
to discuss a breakthrough he's had.

01:07.610 --> 01:08.737
His cabin?

01:08.820 --> 01:11.114
Yes, he lives off the grid
up in the mountains.

01:11.614 --> 01:13.616
So, you're gonna
go to the middle of nowhere

01:13.700 --> 01:15.994
and spend the weekend
with a crazy man you've never met?

01:17.036 --> 01:18.246
Yes, why?

01:20.331 --> 01:21.458
No reason, have fun.

01:50.528 --> 01:51.529
Hmm.

01:54.073 --> 01:55.074
Oh.

01:58.578 --> 01:59.621
Hmm.

02:02.165 --> 02:03.458
Nice one.

02:04.417 --> 02:07.086
Hey, Penny, that's what you sound like
when you read.

02:09.255 --> 02:11.090
- Hey.
- What, he said it.

02:12.592 --> 02:13.802
Sheldon, what are you doing?

02:14.052 --> 02:17.764
I'm decoding Doctor Wolcott's letter
using this book as the key.

02:17.847 --> 02:19.933
Aren't conversations more fun
when they're in code?

02:20.058 --> 02:23.353
Yes, but I'm using a code
where "yes" means "no."

02:24.646 --> 02:27.857
Oh, I got it.
He's given me directions to his cabin.

02:27.941 --> 02:29.317
Seems a little paranoid.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.028
Wha... He is not paranoid.

02:32.821 --> 02:33.947
What are you doing?

02:34.030 --> 02:35.198
Following his instructions.

02:42.497 --> 02:44.958
Leonard, you are not letting
Sheldon go alone this weekend.

02:45.041 --> 02:48.419
Well, I am a grown man,
I don't need somebody to chaperone me.

02:48.503 --> 02:51.339
I just need him to drop me off,
pick me up and pack me a sack lunch.

02:53.216 --> 02:54.300
Don't look at me.

02:54.384 --> 02:56.177
When the music stopped,
you were holding Sheldon.

02:57.720 --> 03:00.181
Amy can't take him, it's her
bachelorette party this weekend.

03:00.265 --> 03:03.017
Yes, it is! Because I'm getting married!

03:04.310 --> 03:05.562
Are you gonna be doing that all weekend?

03:05.645 --> 03:06.646
Yes, do you know why?

03:06.729 --> 03:07.730
Because you're getting married!

03:10.108 --> 03:11.734
All right, Leonard,
looks like you're driving me.

03:11.818 --> 03:13.820
But maybe you could drop me
at the bottom of the mountain,

03:13.903 --> 03:15.154
I want him to think I'm cool.

03:16.614 --> 03:18.741
That's great,
everyone's got weekend plans.

03:18.825 --> 03:20.076
Amy has her bachelorette party

03:20.159 --> 03:22.120
and Sheldon's gonna go to the woods
and get hunted for sport.

03:23.621 --> 03:26.416
Yeah, as someone who has to track him
every time he gets lost in IKEA,

03:26.499 --> 03:27.709
I fee I like I'd be really good at that.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.461
Leonard, you cannot drop him off,

03:30.545 --> 03:32.463
you have to stay with him
and keep him safe.

03:32.547 --> 03:34.382
Howard, you have to go
and keep Leonard safe.

03:34.465 --> 03:36.092
- Fine.
- I get it.

03:36.175 --> 03:38.344
And you want me to go
and keep Howard safe.

03:38.428 --> 03:39.679
- Actually, I...
- Just say yes

03:39.762 --> 03:41.431
or he's gonna want to
come to the bachelorette party.

03:45.476 --> 03:47.645
Are you sure
you're going to be okay this weekend?

03:47.854 --> 03:50.815
Of course.
I'm much more concerned about you.

03:50.899 --> 03:53.443
I know how you gals behave
when the men are away.

03:55.028 --> 03:56.112
You do?

03:56.195 --> 03:58.948
I've read the <i>Bacchae</i> by Euripides.

03:59.032 --> 04:01.492
Drinking wine, riding panthers...

04:03.536 --> 04:06.039
Proof that girls have gone wild
for over 2500 years.

04:07.582 --> 04:09.500
Well, I wish I could say
none of that is gonna happen,

04:09.584 --> 04:10.919
but Penny is planning it,

04:11.002 --> 04:14.380
and she is the reason I own those
underwear with writing across the butt.

04:15.882 --> 04:20.178
Well, just be careful
and use protection.

04:21.679 --> 04:23.389
What do you think is gonna happen?

04:23.848 --> 04:26.809
I don't know, but it's going to be sunny
and you burn easily.

04:28.436 --> 04:29.938
It'll be fine.

04:30.021 --> 04:32.315
I'm sure there'll be some drinking
and some dancing

04:32.398 --> 04:35.401
and then a mailman will probably show up
and take his clothes off.

04:35.485 --> 04:37.695
Nicholas is going to
take his clothes off?

04:39.155 --> 04:43.660
No, not our mailman.
A dancer pretending to be a mailman.

04:43.743 --> 04:47.080
Impersonating a federal employee,
oh, where's the after party, prison?

04:50.500 --> 04:52.418
It's sweet that you're worried about me.

04:52.502 --> 04:55.213
Well, of course I'm worried about you.
I want you to be safe.

04:55.296 --> 04:56.589
And I want you to be safe.

04:56.673 --> 04:59.133
I will be. I'll have my friends with me.

04:59.217 --> 05:01.761
If anything should go wrong
I can use them as human shields.

05:05.890 --> 05:07.892
<i>For most of human history,</i>

05:07.976 --> 05:12.063
<i>time was believed to be
an objective part of reality.</i>

05:12.146 --> 05:15.942
<i>But with the contributions
of Immanuel Kant,</i>

05:16.025 --> 05:17.694
<i>science and philosophy charted...</i>

05:17.777 --> 05:21.531
When I said you should make a playlist
for the road trip, I meant music.

05:24.367 --> 05:28.454
This is better than music.
This is a lecture on non-linear time.

05:28.538 --> 05:30.331
Sounds like it's just on regular time.

05:30.415 --> 05:32.291
Yes, but I put it on shuffle.

05:35.962 --> 05:37.171
This is nice.

05:37.255 --> 05:39.132
The four of us
haven't taken a trip like this

05:39.215 --> 05:40.883
since Leonard's bachelor party.

05:40.967 --> 05:42.760
And now here we are for Sheldon's.

05:42.844 --> 05:44.637
Leonard...

05:44.721 --> 05:46.639
As Sheldon's best man,

05:46.723 --> 05:49.267
I need to inform you
that this is not a bachelor party.

05:49.434 --> 05:50.518
And tell them why.

05:50.601 --> 05:52.061
Because you're a tiresome scold.

05:54.022 --> 05:58.776
No. It's because a bachelor party is
typically a hedonistic blow-out

05:58.860 --> 06:00.570
where no pleasures
of the flesh are denied.

06:00.653 --> 06:01.904
I'm not interested in that.

06:02.780 --> 06:04.866
How is that not exactly what I said?

06:08.995 --> 06:12.665
Okay, now, I promised Sheldon things
weren't gonna get too crazy tonight.

06:12.749 --> 06:13.875
Should I be worried?

06:13.958 --> 06:16.127
Just about who you're marrying.

06:19.714 --> 06:21.424
Just come on.

06:22.175 --> 06:26.763
Welcome to your bachelorette party!

06:31.517 --> 06:32.935
Oh.

06:34.937 --> 06:36.314
It's a quilting bee!

06:36.397 --> 06:38.816
My bachelorette party's a quilting bee!

06:39.817 --> 06:40.818
Isn't it perfect?

06:40.902 --> 06:44.113
Yeah, instead of oiled-up strippers
and sex toys we thought,

06:44.197 --> 06:46.157
"What does Amy like?"

06:48.993 --> 06:50.578
Amy likes a quilting bee.

06:54.957 --> 06:56.501
Well, this place is creepy.

06:57.126 --> 06:58.127
Why?

06:58.503 --> 07:02.215
Did you see his vegetable garden?
Heirloom tomatoes in April.

07:02.799 --> 07:03.800
Creepy.

07:05.009 --> 07:08.471
Okay, listen. Doctor Wolcott
is a brilliant topologist,

07:08.554 --> 07:10.890
we need to set some ground rules
so that you don't embarrass me.

07:11.432 --> 07:14.519
No magic. No whining. You, just no.

07:16.229 --> 07:17.563
Hey...

07:17.647 --> 07:19.357
How come he gets to whine?

07:21.984 --> 07:25.905
Doctor Wolcott. Doctor Wolcott.
Doctor Wolcott.

07:33.579 --> 07:35.039
That's a lot of locks.

07:35.123 --> 07:37.208
That's a lot of knocks.
They're made for each other.

07:41.295 --> 07:42.296
Doctor Wolcott.

07:42.380 --> 07:45.800
Doctor Cooper. Uh, who are these people?

07:45.883 --> 07:48.386
Oh, these are my friends.
I wrote about them in my letter.

07:48.469 --> 07:50.847
Oh, letter? I didn't get a letter.

07:50.930 --> 07:53.141
Oh, that's because
I just sent it this morning,

07:53.224 --> 07:54.851
so score one for linear time.

07:56.394 --> 07:59.939
Well, um, I don't normally
allow strangers into my house.

08:00.022 --> 08:02.567
But when you do,
you let them out, right?

08:04.902 --> 08:06.612
Doctor Cooper, if you can promise me

08:06.696 --> 08:09.991
these men share
your intellect and academic rigor,

08:10.074 --> 08:12.201
yeah, I suppose they can join us.

08:13.327 --> 08:14.871
You guys might need to wait in the car.

08:22.044 --> 08:23.963
Well, let me show you around.

08:24.046 --> 08:26.841
This is the chair
where I do most of my thinking.

08:26.924 --> 08:28.885
My thinking about work.

08:28.968 --> 08:32.930
Now, my thinking about people
who have wronged me, I do over there.

08:34.724 --> 08:37.143
I've always said that
I should get a grudge chair.

08:37.226 --> 08:38.603
Leonard, have I not always said that?

08:39.145 --> 08:41.731
You have, but you were worried
you'd spend too much time in it.

08:41.814 --> 08:44.734
Well... That is a real concern.

08:45.568 --> 08:51.157
Oh, my God, this tomato is amazing!
I can eat it like an apple.

08:52.116 --> 08:55.369
My secret is I fertilize it
with my own manure.

09:02.168 --> 09:05.379
The look on your face.

09:05.880 --> 09:07.840
It's a sort of grin,
you wanna know what kind?

09:13.471 --> 09:14.680
So, Doctor Wolcott,

09:14.764 --> 09:17.433
in your letter you said you had
a new mathematical approach

09:17.516 --> 09:20.436
that would help me conceptualize
the dimensions in string theory.

09:20.519 --> 09:21.812
Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes.

09:21.896 --> 09:24.357
But, before we get started,

09:24.440 --> 09:27.151
I am going to need
to collect everybody's phones.

09:27.235 --> 09:28.527
- Oh.
- Why?

09:29.028 --> 09:31.948
Because they are
little listening devices, aren't they?

09:32.031 --> 09:35.743
Yes, for people to spy on you
and steal your work.

09:36.202 --> 09:37.370
Yeah, what happened to the good old days

09:37.453 --> 09:38.788
where if someone
wanted to steal your work

09:38.871 --> 09:41.207
they had to hire a prostitute
to seduce you?

09:43.251 --> 09:44.627
Who told you about that?

09:46.545 --> 09:47.838
Just making a joke.

09:47.922 --> 09:49.799
Yeah, it's not funny when it happens.

09:51.759 --> 09:57.056
All right, now, you're probably going to
want to start with this notebook here.

09:57.473 --> 09:58.599
- Oh.
- Here we are.

09:58.683 --> 10:00.810
Oh, my. Oh.

10:03.354 --> 10:06.274
Um, no offense, Doctor Wolcott,
but I'm not sure this makes any sense.

10:06.357 --> 10:08.317
That's because
I've written it all backwards.

10:08.401 --> 10:10.069
You... Wow.

10:11.654 --> 10:13.281
That's "wow" backwards.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.202
You... Um, I still don't get it.

10:18.286 --> 10:20.871
Well, plus, the numbers are letters
and letters are numbers.

10:20.955 --> 10:21.956
Oh.

10:22.581 --> 10:23.582
I love him.

10:36.387 --> 10:37.722
Are you having fun?

10:40.266 --> 10:43.769
Yeah, I just, uh,
finished sewing this top-to-bottom,

10:44.854 --> 10:46.522
and now
I'm going to sew it side-to-side.

10:48.858 --> 10:50.609
Pace yourself.

10:51.027 --> 10:52.987
- Some more tea?
- Oh, lovely.

10:59.410 --> 11:00.411
Oh!

11:01.787 --> 11:03.205
Seriously? What the hell?

11:04.540 --> 11:05.541
- Huh?
- What?

11:05.624 --> 11:08.711
This is my bachelorette party,
tea and quilts?

11:08.794 --> 11:11.213
Well, you said
you didn't want anything crazy.

11:11.297 --> 11:13.758
Yes, but I said it like,
"I don't want anything crazy,"

11:14.342 --> 11:16.260
which clearly means
I wanted something crazy.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.805
I mean,
is this how boring you think I am?

11:21.015 --> 11:22.266
Penny, she asked you a question.

11:24.602 --> 11:26.103
Of course not.

11:26.187 --> 11:27.813
So, you thought that
I would like quilting?

11:27.897 --> 11:29.065
Well, don't you?

11:29.148 --> 11:31.817
Of course, I like quilting,
it's the slowest way to make a blanket.

11:33.736 --> 11:35.446
But this is my bachelorette party.

11:35.529 --> 11:38.991
It's supposed to be fun and wild
and full of bad decisions.

11:39.325 --> 11:40.868
Hey, we can make bad decisions.

11:40.951 --> 11:43.996
Yeah, she had two kids back-to-back
and I thought you'd like this,

11:44.080 --> 11:45.289
so we're off to a good start.

11:47.416 --> 11:50.419
Come on, let's go somewhere we can do
body shots off shirtless bartenders.

11:50.503 --> 11:51.504
Yes.

11:51.587 --> 11:52.922
Oh, I don't know,
that might be too much.

11:53.005 --> 11:55.007
All right, you know what, why don't
we stay home and have a little wine...

11:55.091 --> 11:56.759
What are you not getting about this?

12:00.638 --> 12:03.891
Doctor Wolcott,
your work on time is revolutionary.

12:03.974 --> 12:06.394
I would say thank you,
but in my theory of time

12:06.477 --> 12:08.396
you've already
called my work revolutionary,

12:08.479 --> 12:09.563
I've already thanked you,

12:09.647 --> 12:12.233
and I hate repeating myself,
so let's move on.

12:14.860 --> 12:16.320
Wait a minute. Are you saying

12:16.404 --> 12:18.739
that time has multiple dimensions,
the same as space?

12:18.823 --> 12:22.118
No, no. I'm not saying it,
the math is saying it.

12:22.701 --> 12:26.038
Though, it is the math that I invented,
so, yes, I guess I am saying it.

12:27.998 --> 12:29.875
You understanding any of this?

12:30.418 --> 12:33.212
I haven't understood anything
since poop-tomato.

12:35.172 --> 12:37.716
My goodness, this is incredible.

12:37.800 --> 12:41.053
See, I... I'm just not seeing
where string theory fits into all this

12:41.137 --> 12:43.472
and that's where I think that you and I
could be of help to each other.

12:43.764 --> 12:45.099
Thank you, I'd be honored.

12:45.182 --> 12:47.643
All right. Allow me to
show you my most recent journal.

12:50.438 --> 12:54.150
Sheldon's right,
this guy... This guy's brilliant.

12:54.442 --> 12:57.445
Yeah, I mean, he's a little kooky,

12:57.528 --> 12:59.613
but a mind that can reconceptualize time

12:59.697 --> 13:01.782
probably has a reason
for keeping a jar of toenail clippings

13:01.866 --> 13:03.200
that we just don't understand.

13:04.785 --> 13:07.413
I could spend months up here
just going through his math.

13:07.496 --> 13:08.914
You know, I think Sheldon might.

13:08.998 --> 13:11.125
Great, who's gonna tell Amy

13:11.208 --> 13:14.044
we lost her fiancé
to a mad man in the mountains?

13:15.838 --> 13:16.922
Hey, I drove.

13:21.218 --> 13:23.846
This is so exciting.
Can we do a body shot?

13:23.929 --> 13:26.765
I've always wanted to do a body shot.
Also, what's a body shot?

13:28.058 --> 13:30.603
It's when you take a drink
out of a stranger's belly button.

13:30.686 --> 13:32.271
Oh, no thanks.

13:32.354 --> 13:34.982
What if they have an outie?
Does it just spill everywhere?

13:36.609 --> 13:39.195
Okay, look, we've got all night.
Let's just take it easy...

13:39.278 --> 13:40.362
I'm getting married!

13:43.324 --> 13:45.117
Here you go, first round's on the house.

13:45.201 --> 13:47.745
- Ooh.
- Hey, there. Do you do body shots?

13:47.828 --> 13:49.205
Oh. She said she didn't want one...

13:49.288 --> 13:50.289
Mind your business.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.542
Cheers!

13:57.922 --> 14:01.383
Amy? Amy? Should we get her home?

14:01.884 --> 14:04.386
Why? She's sound asleep
and we have sliders coming.

14:05.137 --> 14:06.347
One more round.

14:08.724 --> 14:11.810
So, how would this work
in the context of a singularity?

14:12.102 --> 14:14.813
Yes, that's a tricky bit to explain.

14:14.897 --> 14:17.191
I assume you're familiar
with non-abelian group theory.

14:17.274 --> 14:20.569
Oh, and how! You never
forget your first group theory.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.988
Listen, I'm going to put
on a pot of coffee,

14:23.072 --> 14:24.949
because there's a
lot of math to go through.

14:25.074 --> 14:27.117
And he said he didn't
want a wild bachelor party.

14:27.618 --> 14:28.619
Excuse me?

14:28.702 --> 14:30.955
Oh, Sheldon is getting married
in a month.

14:31.038 --> 14:35.584
Oh, congratulations.
Yeah, I'm a married man myself.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.211
Oh, really? Is she here?

14:37.294 --> 14:38.295
And alive?

14:40.548 --> 14:43.008
And... And can people
other than you see her?

14:45.469 --> 14:47.763
She lives in Munich.
It's a perfect marriage.

14:47.846 --> 14:52.434
We focus on our work and send each other
cards every year on our birthdays.

14:52.810 --> 14:54.436
Wait, what... What month is it?

14:54.770 --> 14:56.146
- Uh, April.
- Most years.

14:57.481 --> 14:59.400
The point is we give each other space.

14:59.483 --> 15:01.819
I give her Europe,
she gives me South America,

15:01.902 --> 15:04.530
that's where she thinks I'm living.

15:06.156 --> 15:09.451
Oh, I... I've never considered
a long distance marriage.

15:09.535 --> 15:11.453
Well, listen,
if you want to be a great scientist

15:11.537 --> 15:12.997
you can't afford to be distracted.

15:13.831 --> 15:17.459
Hey, where are my manners?
You fellows must be hungry.

15:18.168 --> 15:19.753
- Do you like rabbit?
- Yeah. Sure.

15:19.837 --> 15:21.630
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

15:22.464 --> 15:26.302
But can you tell the
difference between rabbit and squirrel?

15:26.510 --> 15:27.678
- No. Don't think so.
- Probably not.

15:27.761 --> 15:31.557
Great, we're having rabbit.

15:34.560 --> 15:35.561
Be right back.

15:38.856 --> 15:41.400
It's amazing how much he's accomplished

15:41.483 --> 15:44.570
by isolating himself from
the distractions of day-to-day life.

15:44.653 --> 15:47.406
Okay, please don't tell me
you wanna live like this.

15:47.990 --> 15:50.284
See, that's the strange thing, I don't.

15:51.577 --> 15:55.372
What is wrong with me?
Why don't I want this?

15:55.456 --> 15:57.124
Look how cool it all is.

15:58.459 --> 15:59.460
Nothing is wrong with you.

15:59.543 --> 16:03.213
You have friends, you have a fiancée.
You have a full life.

16:05.049 --> 16:07.968
You know what? You're right.

16:09.678 --> 16:11.472
Thank you for bringing me up here.

16:12.931 --> 16:14.725
But I think I'm ready to go home now.

16:15.059 --> 16:17.895
Really? You don't want to stay
for dinner and talk more science?

16:17.978 --> 16:22.232
No, no, we better go. I miss Amy.
And my phone.

16:28.447 --> 16:29.948
Also, I'm from Texas

16:30.032 --> 16:32.409
and I can taste the difference
between rabbit and squirrel.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.708
Whoa... Huh?

16:41.710 --> 16:44.630
- Oh, look who's back.
- There she is.

16:44.713 --> 16:46.215
What happened? How did we get here?

16:47.549 --> 16:48.717
You don't remember anything?

16:48.801 --> 16:53.013
I remember taking some shots
and then... That's it.

16:54.306 --> 16:55.891
Oh, my gosh, did I pass out?

16:56.225 --> 16:57.476
You kinda did.

16:57.559 --> 17:00.354
At my own bachelorette party?
I'm so lame.

17:01.855 --> 17:05.192
Oh, you didn't pass out
before you did all kinds of fun stuff.

17:05.442 --> 17:06.443
What did I do?

17:06.527 --> 17:09.697
What did you do?

17:09.780 --> 17:11.407
What did she do?

17:14.243 --> 17:17.621
Um, well, you don't remember
Riverdancing on top of the bar?

17:23.043 --> 17:25.129
- I did that?
- Yeah, you did.

17:25.212 --> 17:26.213
Mmm.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.674
But I don't know how to Riverdance.

17:29.717 --> 17:32.636
Didn't stop you from
teaching all those shirtless firemen.

17:35.431 --> 17:37.099
I saw shirtless firemen?

17:37.599 --> 17:39.601
Saw, smelled, slid down like a pole.

17:42.146 --> 17:43.605
Did I flash anybody?

17:43.689 --> 17:45.691
How about "everybody"?

17:48.068 --> 17:52.489
I can't believe it, I'm so embarrassed.
You didn't take any pictures, did you?

17:52.573 --> 17:53.991
Oh, no, we would never do that to you.

17:54.074 --> 17:57.494
Yeah, but if there were pictures,
they would be crazy.

17:59.580 --> 18:00.873
- You guys are good friends.
- Mmm.

18:13.635 --> 18:15.429
Dinner!

18:17.639 --> 18:19.057
Guys?

18:21.560 --> 18:24.062
I can't believe they left
without saying goodbye.

18:24.980 --> 18:27.816
Wait a minute,
what if they stole my work?

18:27.900 --> 18:31.737
Wait a minute,
what if they were never here at all?

18:32.905 --> 18:34.656
Wait a minute,

18:34.740 --> 18:38.202
what if they haven't gotten here yet
but they're on their way?

18:39.411 --> 18:40.913
I'd better tidy up.

18:51.882 --> 18:52.966
Hello.

18:53.425 --> 18:55.010
Welcome back. How did it go?

18:55.761 --> 18:58.263
Doctor Wolcott's theories of time

18:58.347 --> 19:01.266
might save
my new interpretation of string theory.

19:01.642 --> 19:02.810
Well, that's exciting.

19:02.893 --> 19:06.355
Yeah, it is.
How was your bachelorette party?

19:06.814 --> 19:11.276
Well, I was in a bar
and I saw some shirtless men.

19:12.402 --> 19:14.238
They were firemen
and they fought over me.

19:16.532 --> 19:18.283
But, Penny and Bernadette
got me out of there

19:18.367 --> 19:20.202
before the victor got my spoils.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.331
I see.

19:25.833 --> 19:27.709
What's the matter? You look glum.

19:29.336 --> 19:33.882
Amy, would you still love me
if I wasn't who you thought I was?

19:34.758 --> 19:35.926
What are you talking about?

19:36.385 --> 19:41.014
Well, what if it turns out
I'm not the single-minded,

19:41.098 --> 19:42.933
science-obsessed recluse

19:43.016 --> 19:45.352
who puts his work
above everything and everybody else

19:45.435 --> 19:46.687
that you fell in love with?

19:50.899 --> 19:53.151
What if I'm not the straight-laced,

19:53.235 --> 19:55.279
buttoned-up,
quilting queen you thought I was?

19:57.364 --> 20:00.367
What if I'm a Riverdancing wild woman?

20:08.375 --> 20:09.376
I'd still love you.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.295
I'd still love you, too.

20:14.172 --> 20:15.591
Do you really know how to Riverdance?

20:23.056 --> 20:24.057
You tell me.

20:36.695 --> 20:38.280
I'm the only man you do that for.
