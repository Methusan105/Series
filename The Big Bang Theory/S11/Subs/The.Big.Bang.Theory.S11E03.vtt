WEBVTT

00:03.463 --> 00:05.006
Hmm, some news of our wedding.

00:05.131 --> 00:07.676
I have sent you all
a save the date email.

00:07.842 --> 00:09.469
Oh, exciting. You guys picked a date?

00:09.552 --> 00:11.638
Better, I picked eighty dates.

00:12.430 --> 00:14.849
And I need you to save them all
until we narrow it down.

00:15.684 --> 00:17.394
I thought we agreed on June 15th.

00:18.103 --> 00:19.479
That's the day after Flag Day.

00:20.105 --> 00:21.272
Everybody will be partied out.

00:22.941 --> 00:24.693
It's a date, just pick one.

00:24.776 --> 00:28.029
It's not just a date,
it's a textbook optimization problem.

00:28.154 --> 00:29.406
There is a perfect date,

00:29.572 --> 00:32.242
just like there's a perfect
room temperature and a perfect dessert.

00:32.367 --> 00:34.244
Hmm. There's no perfect dessert.

00:34.452 --> 00:36.955
Yellow cake in the shape of a dinosaur
with chocolate frosting,

00:37.038 --> 00:39.207
scoop of vanilla ice cream
on the side, not touching.

00:40.917 --> 00:42.502
You'll see,
you'll have it at our wedding.

00:44.254 --> 00:45.255
You wanna bet?

00:46.923 --> 00:49.718
You give me enough time, I can do
the same thing with the wedding date.

00:49.801 --> 00:52.887
It needs to be on the weekend,
not near any of your birthdays

00:52.971 --> 00:54.264
or the weekend of Comic-Con.

00:54.347 --> 00:55.807
Oh, you can get married at Comic-Con.

00:55.890 --> 00:56.891
- No!
- No!

00:58.601 --> 01:01.813
We just need a weekend date
that's completely boring and uneventful.

01:02.355 --> 01:03.732
Too bad you didn't get
your ducks in a row

01:03.815 --> 01:05.191
'cause tonight would've been perfect.

01:37.724 --> 01:38.725
Good morning.

01:39.517 --> 01:40.518
Good morning.

01:41.060 --> 01:43.772
I know today is Apple Jack's day,
but we're all out.

01:44.314 --> 01:46.566
That's fine. I'll have anything.

01:47.776 --> 01:49.277
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:49.527 --> 01:51.571
You know, whatev.

01:53.990 --> 01:56.367
"Whatev?" I like this side of you.

01:57.285 --> 01:58.495
You know what I like?

01:59.287 --> 02:00.371
Smooth jazz.

02:24.395 --> 02:26.856
Hey, just a reminder,
I'm goin' out for drinks after work.

02:27.273 --> 02:29.484
Great. Just a reminder, you're pregnant.

02:31.486 --> 02:33.571
I'm not drinking,
just taking a new co-worker out.

02:33.780 --> 02:36.407
Just a reminder,
you're married.

02:38.284 --> 02:39.577
Female co-worker.

02:39.994 --> 02:41.996
She's new in town
and I wanna make her feel welcome.

02:42.455 --> 02:44.374
And let her know
the office is full of liars

02:44.457 --> 02:45.834
before everyone tells her I'm mean.

02:47.836 --> 02:48.837
Is she single?

02:49.003 --> 02:51.047
I'm not setting her up with Raj.

02:51.297 --> 02:52.298
What about Stuart?

02:52.507 --> 02:54.759
Are you listening?
I want her to think I'm not mean.

02:56.594 --> 02:59.305
Okay. Well, it's just,
we have two single friends.

03:00.223 --> 03:02.308
Howie, I just met this woman.

03:02.559 --> 03:04.269
Why don't I wait a little
and get to know her.

03:04.561 --> 03:06.020
Maybe I won't like her

03:06.145 --> 03:08.398
and then I'd be happy
to ruin her life with Stuart or Raj.

03:10.400 --> 03:11.526
That's all I ask.

03:15.488 --> 03:16.990
So you guys lived with Sheldon
for a long time.

03:17.115 --> 03:19.033
- Long time.
- So very long.

03:20.869 --> 03:22.996
By the way, congratulations again
on your engagement.

03:23.162 --> 03:24.998
Yeah, you got a good one.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.251
Thanks. So it's strange,

03:28.501 --> 03:30.211
Sheldon was talking
in his sleep last night

03:30.628 --> 03:32.839
and he seemed like
a totally different person.

03:33.047 --> 03:36.676
He was relaxed and loose and calm.

03:37.010 --> 03:38.845
Sheldon's a complicated man.

03:39.304 --> 03:40.388
He said "whatev."

03:40.638 --> 03:42.557
Get him a brain scan,
that might be a tumor.

03:44.809 --> 03:47.270
Well, I think the wedding planning
is really stressful for him

03:47.353 --> 03:49.022
and that can trigger sleep talking.

03:49.314 --> 03:52.483
Maybe this is a part of Sheldon's
personality he's been repressing.

03:52.817 --> 03:55.528
Yeah, I think we dream about things
we wish we could be in real life.

03:56.195 --> 03:57.488
Really? What do you dream about?

03:57.697 --> 03:59.115
Oh, uh...

03:59.616 --> 04:01.951
Being the wife of Leonard, mostly that.

04:04.495 --> 04:05.496
I choose to believe you.

04:07.206 --> 04:08.583
Well, as much as we've
studied the brain,

04:08.666 --> 04:10.919
there's still a lot we don't know
about dreams and their function.

04:11.002 --> 04:12.837
You know, even psychologists
are divided on it.

04:13.087 --> 04:15.590
Mm, it's true. Freud thought dreams
were about sex.

04:15.715 --> 04:17.008
Adler thought they were about dominance.

04:17.091 --> 04:20.178
Then again mine are just about
being married to this little guy.

04:22.472 --> 04:24.307
Okay, now it's just edging into mockery.

04:27.310 --> 04:29.896
Well, moving to a new city
was a little scary,

04:30.063 --> 04:32.482
but the job seems great.
Everyone's really nice.

04:32.649 --> 04:34.359
Oh, they are, super nice.

04:34.776 --> 04:36.569
I mean, only one of them
took you out tonight,

04:36.653 --> 04:38.738
but it's not a competition.

04:39.697 --> 04:40.907
Thanks again.

04:41.157 --> 04:43.868
You know, we could've gone somewhere
more pregnancy friendly.

04:43.952 --> 04:47.038
Oh, it's okay. One of the great things
about being pregnant

04:47.121 --> 04:48.957
is drinking cranberry juice
out of a wine glass

04:49.040 --> 04:50.667
and watching people freak out.

04:52.043 --> 04:53.044
Bernie!

04:54.337 --> 04:55.338
Oh, damn.

04:56.923 --> 04:58.967
Hey, what are the odds?

05:00.093 --> 05:01.844
Yes, seren-frickin'-dipity.

05:03.554 --> 05:05.723
- Hello, Rajesh.
- Stuart.

05:06.015 --> 05:07.016
Hi, Ruchi.

05:07.475 --> 05:08.685
Ruchi is my co-worker,

05:08.851 --> 05:10.853
but that was probably
in your briefing packet.

05:18.820 --> 05:20.488
- Hi.
- Hello.

05:20.905 --> 05:21.906
What's wrong?

05:21.990 --> 05:24.367
Well, I found
the perfect wedding date.

05:24.867 --> 05:25.994
That's terrific!

05:26.077 --> 05:29.163
No, it's not, it was May 19th, 1996.

05:31.290 --> 05:33.084
We would've had a lovely wedding

05:33.376 --> 05:34.711
and our honeymoon would have coincided

05:34.794 --> 05:36.671
with the first appearance
of the Hale-Bopp comet.

05:38.172 --> 05:39.424
Sheldon, you were 16.

05:39.757 --> 05:42.218
And in Texas,
no one would have batted an eye.

05:42.885 --> 05:44.012
Oh, wait, it's no good,

05:44.095 --> 05:46.514
that's the day that Jon Pertwee,
the third <i>Doctor Who</i> died.

05:46.973 --> 05:49.225
- And it's in the past.
- Hey, I said it's no good,

05:49.308 --> 05:50.309
just let it go.

05:51.769 --> 05:55.648
Sheldon, I appreciate you trying
to make this wedding perfect,

05:56.399 --> 05:57.692
but it's making you miserable.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.485
The wedding isn't making me miserable,

05:59.694 --> 06:01.029
the calendar is.

06:01.279 --> 06:03.156
Why can't there just be
one week each month

06:03.239 --> 06:04.657
for famous people to die?

06:06.325 --> 06:08.119
Well, they've already arranged
to die in threes.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.245
What more do you want from them?

06:10.705 --> 06:13.458
This is so frustrating.
Why can't I find the perfect date?

06:13.916 --> 06:16.252
I found the perfect way
to say hi to cowboys.

06:18.546 --> 06:21.549
I'm just saying,
maybe there's a part of you deep down

06:22.300 --> 06:24.385
that just wants to
relax a little, you know,

06:24.969 --> 06:27.346
kick back, say "whatev."

06:28.973 --> 06:30.308
"Whatev?"

06:31.059 --> 06:33.019
I'm sorry, are you really not gonna
finish that word?

06:34.353 --> 06:36.481
- I'm just trying to make a point.
- Finish the word, Amy.

06:38.149 --> 06:39.150
Fine, "er."

06:40.109 --> 06:41.110
Er, er, er.

06:41.652 --> 06:44.280
Thank you, only now you owe me
three more "whatevs."

06:47.658 --> 06:49.952
Ah, you were born in Trivandrum.

06:50.203 --> 06:52.288
Have you ever been
to the Kuthira Malika Palace?

06:52.789 --> 06:53.790
No, I haven't.

06:54.248 --> 06:56.292
Me either. What a small world!

06:57.960 --> 06:59.295
I've also never been there.

06:59.587 --> 07:02.090
I've never been lots of places.
Go on, quiz me.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.676
I'm sorry, we're being rude
talking about India.

07:05.968 --> 07:08.596
Oh, yeah, you know, if you
and Bernadette wanna talk about America,

07:08.679 --> 07:09.806
that's cool with us.

07:09.889 --> 07:11.015
Here, let me get you started.

07:11.808 --> 07:13.309
Hamburgers, am I right?

07:16.145 --> 07:17.271
So what do you guys do?

07:17.772 --> 07:20.149
Well, I'm an astrophysicist,

07:20.316 --> 07:23.194
so if you ever go out at night
and look up at the stars,

07:23.444 --> 07:25.113
it's kind of my office.

07:25.780 --> 07:27.365
He sells comic books to children.

07:29.742 --> 07:31.619
Actually, I own my own store,

07:31.953 --> 07:34.163
if you'd like
to check it out sometime,

07:34.413 --> 07:35.581
I'm running a new promotion,

07:35.706 --> 07:39.293
"Buy anything, get taken out
for a reasonably-priced dinner."

07:39.919 --> 07:42.505
Yeah, yeah,
Stuart's struggling financially,

07:42.713 --> 07:45.424
but he doesn't let that get him down.
He believes in himself,

07:45.716 --> 07:48.427
even though the whole world
has made it clear he should not.

07:53.182 --> 07:54.183
Thank you,

07:54.267 --> 07:56.227
and you know, Raj, I think it's great

07:56.310 --> 07:59.105
that you no longer live off your parents
like a spoiled child.

07:59.188 --> 08:02.650
You live over someone's garage,
like a failed adult.

08:04.402 --> 08:05.778
Yeah, well, you live with her.

08:06.737 --> 08:10.074
Oh, it's not like that. He rents a room
from me and my husband,

08:10.324 --> 08:12.034
who, by the way is no prize either.

08:16.789 --> 08:18.416
Oh, I don't care.

08:18.958 --> 08:21.335
You know me, I just go with the flow.

08:24.589 --> 08:26.716
Beach, public pool,

08:27.466 --> 08:29.093
they both sound awesome.

08:31.429 --> 08:33.723
<i>On second thought, beach,</i>

08:34.265 --> 08:36.058
<i>I'd like to befriend a seagull.</i>

08:38.186 --> 08:39.187
That is crazy.

08:39.645 --> 08:42.106
Yeah. Will you email that to me?

08:43.733 --> 08:45.067
Have you played this for him?

08:45.359 --> 08:47.987
No, I'm worried he'll say
I violated his privacy.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.072
Listen, how happy he sounds.

08:50.573 --> 08:51.949
<i>I'm up for anything.</i>

08:52.825 --> 08:54.327
<i>As long as I'm with you.</i>

08:56.621 --> 08:57.663
What're you listening to?

08:57.747 --> 08:58.748
Nothing.

08:58.831 --> 09:00.208
Oh, come on, I wanna hear.

09:02.627 --> 09:04.587
<i>We don't need GPS,</i>

09:05.338 --> 09:07.548
<i>let's just see where the road takes us.</i>

09:09.383 --> 09:10.760
I see why you turned it off,

09:10.843 --> 09:12.053
that guy sounds like an idiot.

09:13.679 --> 09:14.889
Honey, that's you.

09:15.056 --> 09:18.226
Don't be silly.
My voice is deep and sonorous,

09:18.935 --> 09:20.686
like a Caucasian James Earl Jones.

09:22.855 --> 09:24.649
"Luke, I'm your father." See.

09:26.192 --> 09:28.945
It is you. I recorded you in your sleep.

09:29.904 --> 09:31.989
<i>Oh, look, a hitchhiker,</i>

09:32.949 --> 09:35.201
<i>I bet he has some interesting stories.</i>

09:37.370 --> 09:39.080
- That's me?
- It's you.

09:40.206 --> 09:41.958
So you spied on me in my sleep?

09:42.333 --> 09:43.584
Sheldon, I'm sorry,

09:43.709 --> 09:45.211
you've been doing this every night.

09:45.378 --> 09:47.129
I couldn't help but wonder
if it meant something.

09:47.463 --> 09:49.340
- Well, it doesn't.
- Are you sure?

09:50.049 --> 09:52.760
I mean, the prefrontal cortex
regulates impulse control,

09:53.261 --> 09:54.887
so its plausible that when we're asleep,

09:55.012 --> 09:58.015
aspects of our personality
that we repress might come out.

09:59.267 --> 10:01.936
Don't try to put science lipstick
on your New Age pig.

10:03.271 --> 10:05.314
And for the record,
you make noises when you sleep

10:05.439 --> 10:08.025
and I've never accused you
of repressing your inner chainsaw.

10:12.363 --> 10:13.823
If you want me to
object at your wedding,

10:13.906 --> 10:15.116
just give me one of these.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.586
This picture of Galactus eating a planet
looks like my preggo wife

10:27.753 --> 10:28.921
destroying a coffee cake.

10:31.674 --> 10:32.800
Oh, yeah, I see it.

10:34.093 --> 10:36.178
I'm just saying, you should bow out.

10:36.262 --> 10:37.596
Why should I bow out?

10:37.763 --> 10:39.807
Because we all know
how this is gonna end.

10:40.391 --> 10:43.102
That's what my doctor said, too,
but I'm still here.

10:46.147 --> 10:49.358
Okay, look, I think that
she and I have more in common.

10:50.318 --> 10:51.402
Because you're Indian?

10:51.610 --> 10:53.738
So just 'cause she's brown,
you get to date her.

10:54.572 --> 10:55.573
Yes.

10:56.157 --> 10:59.827
And the next time we meet a woman who's
pale and cadaver-like, she's all yours.

11:01.996 --> 11:04.165
Howard, Bernadette was there last night,

11:04.248 --> 11:05.833
did she say anything when she got home?

11:06.292 --> 11:09.712
Yeah, she said, "Why'd you tell
those idiots where I was? Thanks a lot."

11:10.588 --> 11:12.006
Okay, how about we flip a coin?

11:12.256 --> 11:15.259
Hang on, doesn't this girl
get a word in all of this

11:15.343 --> 11:16.969
and isn't that word "no"?

11:18.471 --> 11:20.473
Ruchi said she wanted to hang out
with both of us,

11:20.556 --> 11:21.724
why don't we just do that?

11:22.099 --> 11:25.019
Oh, fine. Let's hang out as friends
and see what happens.

11:25.269 --> 11:27.730
Yeah, and if something grows out of it,
just worry about it then.

11:28.064 --> 11:29.440
Also what my doctor said.

11:34.403 --> 11:36.322
Hey, this isn't your laundry night.

11:36.405 --> 11:38.783
I know, laundry on a Wednesday.

11:39.408 --> 11:40.826
Some madness my life has become.

11:42.953 --> 11:45.623
Why is this sleep talking thing
bothering you anyway?

11:45.873 --> 11:46.874
It's simple.

11:46.957 --> 11:48.667
I don't like the idea that my mind

11:48.793 --> 11:50.836
might be keeping
an entire personality from me.

11:51.337 --> 11:53.756
Doctor Jekyll's other personality
was Mr. Hyde.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.593
Mr. Hyde didn't have
a postgraduate degree.

11:59.470 --> 12:01.430
Is it possible that you're stressed

12:01.514 --> 12:03.432
because you're scared
about getting married?

12:03.891 --> 12:07.103
I mean, it is a big change
and you're not good with little changes.

12:07.853 --> 12:09.355
That's nonsense.

12:09.480 --> 12:11.774
You name one little change
I was upset with.

12:12.274 --> 12:15.444
Uh, when they changed
the green Skittle from lime to apple.

12:16.529 --> 12:18.572
That is not the rainbow
I grew up tasting.

12:20.574 --> 12:21.992
All right, fine. Let's start over.

12:22.118 --> 12:23.619
Is it possible

12:23.702 --> 12:25.663
that the sleep talking is a part
of your brain that's telling you

12:25.746 --> 12:28.666
everything's gonna be okay
and you just need to relax a little?

12:29.458 --> 12:31.919
So, you're proposing that

12:32.169 --> 12:33.712
the self is an illusion.

12:34.130 --> 12:37.299
And that we actually have
multiple centers of consciousness

12:37.383 --> 12:39.176
that are communicating with one another?

12:41.846 --> 12:43.556
In layman's terms, yeah.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.684
Huh! Interesting.

12:47.143 --> 12:49.728
So you don't believe
there is a Cartesian self

12:49.812 --> 12:51.814
that underlies the flux of experience.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.567
Maybe in my twenties, not anymore.

12:56.193 --> 12:57.403
Okay.

12:58.362 --> 12:59.572
Well assuming you're right,

12:59.989 --> 13:01.490
what would you suggest I do?

13:02.158 --> 13:03.576
Well, I would start
with something small.

13:03.826 --> 13:05.035
See if it makes your life any better.

13:05.244 --> 13:07.955
Uh, you could learn to meditate,
take a yoga class.

13:09.582 --> 13:12.543
You know, I have always
been intrigued by flip-flops,

13:14.753 --> 13:16.964
the official footwear
of the laid back fellow.

13:18.382 --> 13:19.592
Okay. Sure.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.260
Of course if my feet
are gonna be exposed

13:21.343 --> 13:22.595
I'll need to update my tetanus booster.

13:23.137 --> 13:24.597
Oh, yeah. Makes sense.

13:25.181 --> 13:27.391
And while I'm there, I might as well
get a flu shot and a mole check.

13:27.475 --> 13:28.517
Sure.

13:28.976 --> 13:30.686
You know, I've never had a mole check.

13:30.853 --> 13:32.229
Oh.

13:32.897 --> 13:34.190
Well, it's been nice knowing you.

13:38.569 --> 13:40.154
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.740
It's too bad Stuart couldn't make it.
He seemed fun.

13:43.324 --> 13:45.534
Oh, yeah. He is. I love him dearly.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.870
Not to say that I don't worry about him.

13:48.537 --> 13:49.663
What's to worry about?

13:50.998 --> 13:53.292
You know what?
I'm talking out of school.

13:55.085 --> 13:57.046
Speaking of which,
he's allowed to live near them now.

13:59.924 --> 14:01.258
Hey, guys!

14:01.425 --> 14:03.552
- Oh, great, Stuart, you're here.
- Yes, Stuart.

14:03.636 --> 14:05.179
Yeah, I didn't, I didn't think
you were gonna make it.

14:05.262 --> 14:07.264
Hmm. I believe that.

14:09.934 --> 14:11.435
Sorry guys, it's work.
I've got to take it.

14:12.436 --> 14:15.231
- I'm so glad you made it, Stuart.
- Oh, yeah, so glad.

14:16.941 --> 14:18.692
I can't believe you went behind my back.

14:18.859 --> 14:20.945
Which clearly means I want this more.

14:21.278 --> 14:23.781
You wanna play a game
of "who's more desperate" with me,

14:26.075 --> 14:28.160
'cause you're in
the big leagues now, Bucko.

14:29.161 --> 14:31.288
Look, Ruchi and I
are really hitting it off.

14:31.372 --> 14:33.040
Please let me just have this one.

14:33.207 --> 14:36.502
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm like a fungus you can't get rid of.

14:38.254 --> 14:40.297
Sorry. So what's going on?

14:40.631 --> 14:43.801
Oh, you just missed Stuart's funny story
about the fungus he can't get rid of.

14:46.011 --> 14:49.515
Raj didn't tell me about tonight,
so he could be alone with you.

14:51.100 --> 14:53.060
Really? That's a little weird.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.729
Just a little?
Because I can work with that.

14:57.231 --> 14:59.984
Look, guys, I'm not interested
in dating anyone right now.

15:00.150 --> 15:01.819
I'm just looking to make some friends.

15:02.528 --> 15:04.071
Yeah, I totally understand.

15:04.154 --> 15:06.240
But if you were gonna date someone,
would it be me or Stuart?

15:08.826 --> 15:09.827
I think I'm gonna go.

15:11.829 --> 15:12.871
Ruchi, I'm sorry.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.833
If you still wanna
hang out as friends, I'd like that.

15:16.709 --> 15:18.127
Thanks, Stuart. I'd like that, too.

15:21.922 --> 15:24.174
And the fungus is under the toenail.

15:39.732 --> 15:41.567
- Hello.
- Hey.

15:43.569 --> 15:44.903
So, um...

15:45.279 --> 15:46.572
I, uh...

15:48.407 --> 15:49.533
I got flip-flops.

15:51.660 --> 15:52.828
Good for you.

15:53.537 --> 15:55.497
Oh, my God! What happened?

15:56.040 --> 15:58.250
After I got the flip-flops, I realized

15:58.334 --> 16:00.461
that the tops of my feet
were exposed.

16:00.628 --> 16:03.172
So, I put on some sunscreen,

16:03.255 --> 16:05.424
which caused my feet to become slippery.

16:05.883 --> 16:09.678
And predictably, one of them fell off
and went down a sewer grate.

16:10.763 --> 16:13.349
Now normally, I would have walked away,

16:13.557 --> 16:16.685
but this is a new, laid back me.

16:16.852 --> 16:20.773
So, instead of getting upset
I just reached down to grab it.

16:21.398 --> 16:23.609
That's when I touched something furry.

16:26.487 --> 16:29.865
Which I'm telling myself,
was a damp toupee.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.828
When the toupee licked my hand,

16:39.249 --> 16:43.420
I screamed and hopped down the street
on my remaining flip-flop.

16:45.381 --> 16:47.216
- Can I just ask...
- This is a long story,

16:47.299 --> 16:49.134
why don't we please
save your questions till the end?

16:50.719 --> 16:53.597
So, I finally came upon a bus bench

16:53.847 --> 16:56.392
where I sat and removed one of my shirts

16:56.558 --> 16:59.478
and, fashioned it
into a makeshift shoe.

17:00.771 --> 17:02.231
Not a waterproof shoe.

17:02.439 --> 17:04.692
That is relevant
to the next part of my story,

17:06.318 --> 17:09.238
the ankle-deep puddle
of warm apple juice.

17:12.741 --> 17:13.742
Apple juice?

17:14.993 --> 17:16.412
Maybe, maybe not.

17:19.498 --> 17:21.709
I'm telling myself a lot of things, Amy.

17:24.002 --> 17:25.963
What happened to your other flip-flop?

17:26.714 --> 17:30.259
Oh, that involves
what I'm telling myself

17:30.843 --> 17:32.177
was a melted candy bar.

17:37.808 --> 17:39.351
I'm sorry.

17:40.352 --> 17:42.062
Is there anything I can do to help?

17:42.604 --> 17:43.731
Yes.

17:44.064 --> 17:46.900
I want you to be in charge
of our wedding.

17:47.192 --> 17:49.027
Just you tell me where and when,

17:49.194 --> 17:52.573
and I will show up with a boutonniere,
and close-toed shoes,

17:52.865 --> 17:56.827
and, a <i>Star Trek</i> uniform
underneath my tuxedo.

17:58.954 --> 18:00.789
That last part is non-negotiable.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.334
Are you sure that's what you want?

18:05.169 --> 18:07.296
As sure as
I'm about to go bathe in Purell.

18:10.883 --> 18:12.718
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

18:14.553 --> 18:16.889
You know, ever since I was a young girl,

18:18.223 --> 18:20.142
I've dreamed of a June wedding,

18:20.559 --> 18:21.894
maybe on a cliff

18:22.352 --> 18:24.104
overlooking the ocean at sunset.

18:26.064 --> 18:27.065
Sure.

18:31.612 --> 18:32.613
Sounds wonderful.

18:33.822 --> 18:36.742
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go clean up.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.122
Outdoor wedding.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.667
I know what I'll be using
that cliff for.

18:54.468 --> 18:57.429
I call this meeting
of the Council of Sheldons to order.

18:58.096 --> 18:59.389
Let's take roll.

19:00.808 --> 19:01.975
Science Sheldon.

19:02.434 --> 19:03.435
Present.

19:05.395 --> 19:06.396
Texas Sheldon.

19:06.814 --> 19:07.815
Howdy.

19:10.567 --> 19:11.735
Fanboy Sheldon.

19:12.319 --> 19:13.320
Greetings.

19:15.447 --> 19:16.782
Germophobe Sheldon.

19:17.074 --> 19:18.408
Say it, don't spray it.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.622
Where is Jock Sheldon?

19:25.958 --> 19:27.501
Not the time, Humorous Sheldon.

19:29.753 --> 19:31.004
Okay. New business.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.508
Do we grant Laid-back Sheldon

19:34.633 --> 19:35.759
a seat on the council?

19:36.301 --> 19:38.345
Hey, whatever you guys want.

19:40.097 --> 19:42.474
I'm just chilling like Bob Dylan.

19:44.434 --> 19:46.103
- Negative.
- Heck, no.

19:46.311 --> 19:47.771
I don't feel well.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.318
Can we kick him out, too?

20:20.387 --> 20:21.388
English - SDH
