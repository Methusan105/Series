WEBVTT

00:07.717 --> 00:08.968
Howie, slow down.

00:09.302 --> 00:12.222
I can't. I'm not allowed to eat
for 12 hours before my surgery,

00:12.305 --> 00:13.348
and I've only got two more minutes.

00:17.602 --> 00:19.062
What surgery are you having?

00:20.313 --> 00:21.731
I'm stress eating.

00:21.815 --> 00:23.900
My best friend's getting
a vasectomy tomorrow.

00:25.276 --> 00:27.404
And you're sad you won't be able
to bear his child?

00:28.947 --> 00:29.948
Oh, my goodness!

00:30.407 --> 00:33.326
If it's "vasectomy gone wrong" videos,
he's seen them all.

00:33.493 --> 00:34.744
Including the one of the guy

00:34.828 --> 00:37.122
who's sitting on what appears
to be a cantaloupe but is not.

00:39.082 --> 00:40.083
And I'm done.

00:42.085 --> 00:44.879
They're going to start making
Professor Proton's science show again.

00:45.463 --> 00:46.673
I thought he passed away.

00:46.756 --> 00:48.883
He did. He was cremated
and his remains were put

00:48.967 --> 00:50.468
in a baking soda volcano.

00:53.430 --> 00:55.515
Don't make jokes.
He meant a lot to Sheldon.

00:55.807 --> 00:57.434
Mm, me too. I grew up watching his show.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.185
He's one of the reasons
I became a scientist.

00:59.602 --> 01:01.354
Oh, I thought you did it
just to get girls.

01:03.106 --> 01:04.274
Joke's on you. It worked.

01:06.985 --> 01:08.278
Have they found anyone to replace him?

01:08.445 --> 01:10.363
No, not yet. And it won't be easy.

01:10.447 --> 01:13.032
Arthur Jeffries was
an accomplished scientist.

01:13.116 --> 01:15.618
Hmm, you know who'd make
a great Professor Proton?

01:16.119 --> 01:17.245
Meryl Streep.

01:19.497 --> 01:20.498
She's not a scientist.

01:20.874 --> 01:25.003
Uh, then explain to me why she has
chemistry with literally everyone.

01:27.046 --> 01:28.715
It would be nice if they cast a woman.

01:28.840 --> 01:31.050
Oh, you've already got
<i>Dr. Who</i> and the <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

01:31.134 --> 01:32.343
Leave us something.

01:33.845 --> 01:34.846
Who do you think it should be?

01:35.096 --> 01:38.183
Um, it should be a scientist
I respect, you know.

01:38.266 --> 01:42.312
Someone with a pleasing voice
and symmetrical facial features.

01:43.021 --> 01:44.063
Is he talking about himself?

01:44.189 --> 01:46.107
If he's talking,
he's talking about himself.

01:47.901 --> 01:50.904
I just know how much Professor Proton
touched me as a child,

01:51.029 --> 01:53.156
and I feel that I owe it to him

01:53.281 --> 01:55.950
to try and touch
as many children as possible.

02:01.706 --> 02:03.333
You should put that
on your audition tape.

02:33.988 --> 02:35.031
You doing okay?

02:35.365 --> 02:36.783
No, I'm very nervous.

02:49.003 --> 02:50.004
Where are you going?

02:50.421 --> 02:52.674
- Gift shop.
- There is no gift shop. Sit down.

02:55.260 --> 02:56.427
This was your idea.

02:56.511 --> 02:58.972
So was having sex.
And look where that got us.

03:01.099 --> 03:03.393
This isn't a big deal. Stop whining.

03:03.768 --> 03:05.854
When you were in labor
and I said that, you kicked me.

03:07.856 --> 03:08.857
Howard Wolowitz.

03:12.485 --> 03:13.820
- Want me to go with you?
- No.

03:14.112 --> 03:15.864
- I'll be fine.
- Yeah, we got this.

03:15.989 --> 03:17.198
Sit down.

03:21.327 --> 03:23.288
Wish me luck.

03:24.998 --> 03:26.249
Other way, buster.

03:32.839 --> 03:33.840
Okay, you ready?

03:34.090 --> 03:36.634
Yeah, almost. I'm working on
my facial expressions.

03:36.968 --> 03:38.678
See, I've got "interested."

03:39.012 --> 03:40.013
Hmm.

03:40.096 --> 03:42.515
I've got "very interested." Hmm.

03:43.308 --> 03:45.184
And, "enraged."

03:47.854 --> 03:49.230
Why would you be enraged?

03:49.856 --> 03:52.567
Hmm, better to have it and not need it
than to need it and not have it.

03:54.277 --> 03:55.278
Okay.

03:57.447 --> 03:59.324
And rolling.

03:59.824 --> 04:02.785
Hello, I am theoretical physicist
Doctor Sheldon Cooper,

04:02.869 --> 04:05.079
auditioning for the role of
Professor Proton.

04:05.371 --> 04:07.457
Now, excuse me
while I get into character.

04:10.919 --> 04:12.587
Hello, I'm Professor Proton.

04:14.547 --> 04:17.759
And today, boys and girls,
we're going to have fun with science.

04:18.134 --> 04:20.470
Did you know you could calculate
the mass of an electron

04:20.553 --> 04:21.638
using household items?

04:21.804 --> 04:23.890
It's true. All you'll need is a pencil,

04:24.057 --> 04:26.517
some paper, dry ice, rubbing alcohol

04:26.601 --> 04:29.938
and a spool of 50-micron-thick
cobalt-60 wire.

04:31.648 --> 04:33.691
And remember,
don't put it in your mouth.

04:33.858 --> 04:37.278
Or, instead of becoming a scientist,
you'll become wildly radioactive.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.782
Hang on. I have a question.

04:40.907 --> 04:43.451
Do you have any experiments
that aren't life-threatening?

04:43.910 --> 04:46.579
Come on! That was a perfect take,
and you ruined it.

04:47.956 --> 04:49.582
Oh, look, hey! I did need "enraged."

04:52.502 --> 04:54.003
Ow, ow, ow.

04:55.630 --> 04:56.756
Really hurts, huh?

04:56.839 --> 05:00.051
No, he's just saying,
"Ow can these prices be so low?"

05:02.428 --> 05:05.264
It's gonna be okay. A day or two
of rest, and you'll be fine.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.141
You know nothing about Jewish people.

05:12.689 --> 05:14.107
Let me go check on her.

05:15.733 --> 05:17.860
Okay, uh, this is a bit awkward.

05:18.111 --> 05:21.572
It says here that I need to
check the area for redness and swelling.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.077
You know what?
It hurts so much, go ahead.

05:29.372 --> 05:30.832
<i>So you see, boys and girls,</i>

05:30.957 --> 05:32.417
<i>H, or "helicity,"</i>

05:32.583 --> 05:35.294
<i>is the natural variable
to use relativistically,</i>

05:35.461 --> 05:37.463
<i>and is defined as "S dot P,"</i>

05:37.588 --> 05:39.382
<i>divided by the magnitude of P.</i>

05:39.674 --> 05:41.884
<i>So the next time someone
on the playground tells you,</i>

05:42.093 --> 05:43.594
<i>you can only use integral values</i>

05:43.678 --> 05:46.055
<i>for the matrix that determines
the spin of the antiproton,</i>

05:46.180 --> 05:48.683
<i>you stop being friends with that kid,
'cause he's going nowhere.</i>

05:52.729 --> 05:55.606
<i>Until next week,
this is Professor Proton saying,</i>

05:55.773 --> 05:58.609
<i>"Zero one zero zero zero zero one zero</i>

05:58.776 --> 06:01.070
<i>"zero one one one one zero zero one</i>

06:01.279 --> 06:03.865
<i>"zero one one zero zero one zero one.</i>

06:04.657 --> 06:06.617
<i>"That's 'bye" 'in ASCII binary,</i>

06:07.452 --> 06:08.786
<i>or 'good-binary.'"</i>

06:17.253 --> 06:18.254
So,

06:18.963 --> 06:20.048
what do you think?

06:21.007 --> 06:22.800
Well, I already told him
that I loved it,

06:22.925 --> 06:26.846
but if you found it confusing,
or dangerous or,

06:27.138 --> 06:29.640
I don't know,
three to four times too long,

06:30.767 --> 06:32.351
now's the time to share.

06:34.437 --> 06:35.438
I...

06:35.521 --> 06:37.899
I don't know what to say.
Leonard, do you know what to say?

06:39.734 --> 06:41.861
Sheldon, I thought it,

06:42.403 --> 06:44.280
it, uh, it looked like
you were having so much fun.

06:46.115 --> 06:48.117
Hey, that's what you used to tell me

06:48.201 --> 06:49.911
to say to Penny
after one of her terrible plays.

06:50.078 --> 06:51.287
- Hey!
- Hey!

06:53.998 --> 06:55.124
Well, what was wrong with it?

06:55.625 --> 06:57.043
You know, did you find it

06:57.460 --> 06:58.878
borderline psychotic?

07:00.838 --> 07:03.007
I mean, I liked that about it,

07:03.800 --> 07:05.218
but you guys discuss.

07:06.511 --> 07:10.056
Do you remember when you were
a kid and you'd watch Professor Proton?

07:10.598 --> 07:13.518
- Of course.
- Well, did he ever make you

07:15.019 --> 07:16.979
hate science and the people who do it?

07:18.147 --> 07:19.273
What are you saying?

07:19.357 --> 07:20.817
I just think it would be better

07:21.275 --> 07:23.820
if your contempt for children

07:23.903 --> 07:25.363
wasn't so much in the foreground.

07:26.656 --> 07:27.865
You want me to lie?

07:28.407 --> 07:30.827
Look, it's not lying, it's acting.

07:31.077 --> 07:34.497
Sheldon Cooper may not like kids,
but Professor Proton loves them.

07:35.540 --> 07:36.541
Interesting.

07:37.917 --> 07:39.585
You know, I hadn't really
thought of it that way.

07:39.836 --> 07:43.422
It's, it's similar to how, you know,
I'm afraid of dogs

07:43.631 --> 07:46.676
but my DnD character
likes dogs. You know?

07:47.260 --> 07:49.053
But he's allergic,
so he can't be around them.

07:50.721 --> 07:52.140
Why don't we have a dog?

07:55.643 --> 07:57.103
Hey, you can always reshoot it.

07:57.353 --> 07:58.855
Hmm, I suppose.

07:58.938 --> 08:00.398
And, you know,
maybe I could even get some tips

08:00.523 --> 08:02.024
from someone who's acted professionally.

08:02.150 --> 08:06.028
Oh, Sheldon, obviously,
I'd be happy to help you out.

08:08.114 --> 08:09.574
I don't know what to say.

08:12.952 --> 08:14.120
Hey, Sheldon, what's up?

08:14.453 --> 08:15.788
I need an acting coach.

08:15.955 --> 08:16.998
Oh.

08:17.081 --> 08:18.833
Would you give me
Patrick Stewart's number?

08:20.376 --> 08:21.377
No.

08:21.544 --> 08:22.753
Fine. I guess you can do it.

08:27.884 --> 08:29.010
<i>Bernie!</i>

08:31.929 --> 08:33.097
Where did you get a bell?

08:33.514 --> 08:34.515
App store.

08:38.060 --> 08:39.812
Fun, let me see.

08:41.564 --> 08:43.024
When you catch me, you can have it back.

08:45.443 --> 08:47.653
You wanna lie down, watch a movie?

08:47.778 --> 08:50.156
I can't. I got my
16-week check-up to get to

08:50.281 --> 08:52.116
and then I'll pick up
some Chinese for dinner.

08:52.283 --> 08:53.367
I'll take Halley with me.

08:54.410 --> 08:55.661
You sure you're not overdoing it?

08:55.745 --> 08:56.746
No, it's fine.

08:56.829 --> 08:58.080
Great, then maybe instead of Chinese,

08:58.164 --> 08:59.707
fire up the grill
and throw on a couple of steaks?

09:02.668 --> 09:03.669
Kung Pao chicken, please.

09:08.257 --> 09:09.383
- Oh, boy.
- What?

09:09.759 --> 09:11.761
They cast the new Professor Proton.

09:11.928 --> 09:13.429
- Is it Sheldon?
- Not exactly.

09:13.888 --> 09:15.598
<i>Wheaton!</i>

09:15.765 --> 09:16.766
It's Wil Wheaton.

09:26.567 --> 09:27.568
<i>Hi.</i>

09:27.902 --> 09:28.986
Hey.

09:29.237 --> 09:30.238
How was the doctor?

09:30.363 --> 09:32.240
Good, but I have some news.

09:32.657 --> 09:34.909
Don't say twins, don't say twins.

09:36.118 --> 09:37.119
It's not twins.

09:37.203 --> 09:39.789
Only because I would
have loved them both.

09:41.499 --> 09:43.125
The doctor said I was overdoing it,

09:43.209 --> 09:45.336
so, she put me on bed rest
just to be safe.

09:45.670 --> 09:46.879
Oh, no.

09:57.181 --> 09:59.308
It may not look like it,
but I'm running to you.

10:12.446 --> 10:13.489
Hello, Arthur.

10:14.615 --> 10:16.951
What part of "rest in peace"

10:17.868 --> 10:19.203
don't you understand?

10:22.164 --> 10:24.333
I suppose you're here
because you heard the news.

10:24.834 --> 10:27.211
Sheldon, I'm a figment
of your imagination.

10:27.295 --> 10:29.088
I don't hear news.

10:31.882 --> 10:33.050
You're a grumpy figment.

10:36.012 --> 10:37.888
Look. They're remaking your show

10:38.222 --> 10:41.183
and they cast Wil Wheaton
as Professor Proton.

10:41.475 --> 10:43.853
And the worst part is,
he's not even a scientist.

10:45.062 --> 10:47.231
No, the worst part is

10:47.440 --> 10:48.941
I'm sitting on a moist log.

10:53.696 --> 10:56.240
We have to stop this
and protect your legacy.

10:56.699 --> 10:57.700
What legacy?

10:58.034 --> 11:02.038
My, last two seasons, I was on
Sunday morning at 5:30.

11:03.205 --> 11:05.833
We were beat by <i>Davey and Goliath.</i>

11:08.044 --> 11:09.545
I can't believe you don't care.

11:10.546 --> 11:11.547
Believe it.

11:14.175 --> 11:15.968
Well, I care a lot.

11:16.385 --> 11:19.221
And Wil Wheaton
will rue the day he ever met me.

11:21.390 --> 11:23.517
I think that's true of most people.

11:29.648 --> 11:30.649
Hi, guys.

11:30.816 --> 11:32.234
Wanted to check in
and see how you two were doing.

11:32.902 --> 11:33.903
- We're okay.
- Yeah,

11:34.028 --> 11:35.404
hanging out in bed with my wife,

11:35.488 --> 11:38.657
thawing out some frozen peas
in my pants, living the dream.

11:41.452 --> 11:42.912
Oh, I'll get her.

11:43.079 --> 11:44.372
I thought Raj was helping you out.

11:44.622 --> 11:45.706
No, he had to work.

11:45.998 --> 11:49.877
Plus, he has a quota for the amount
of Indian servant jokes he can tolerate.

11:50.086 --> 11:51.087
Apparently, I filled it.

11:51.962 --> 11:53.589
Well, hey, I can get the baby.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.174
No, Howie's got it.

11:55.383 --> 11:56.384
He's fine. Right, Howie?

11:56.467 --> 11:57.510
Never better.

11:58.844 --> 12:00.679
Don't be silly.
I'll take the rest of the day off

12:00.763 --> 12:01.806
and watch Halley for you.

12:02.765 --> 12:04.183
Or we can call Stuart.

12:04.266 --> 12:07.269
I'm sure he could close up the store,
hop on a bus and be here in no time.

12:07.937 --> 12:08.938
He does love the bus.

12:10.940 --> 12:14.443
Okay, hang on. You guys don't trust me
to take care of your baby?

12:14.985 --> 12:16.695
- No.
- No.

12:17.071 --> 12:18.364
<i>- No.
- No.</i>

12:18.656 --> 12:20.032
So, I guess,

12:20.825 --> 12:22.326
no.

12:23.619 --> 12:24.620
Wow.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.580
It's not that we don't trust you,
it's just,

12:26.831 --> 12:28.874
you don't seem like
much of a baby person.

12:28.999 --> 12:32.128
Hey! Hey, hey, I can watch
your stupid baby, okay?

12:34.255 --> 12:36.340
If she cries, I will pick her up.

12:36.465 --> 12:38.259
If she's hungry, I'll give her a bottle.

12:38.342 --> 12:40.136
And if she poops,
I'll light some incense.

12:42.138 --> 12:43.139
It would be a big help.

12:43.889 --> 12:44.890
Okay, thank you.

12:45.057 --> 12:47.435
Trust me, you guys have
nothing to worry about.

12:47.601 --> 12:48.602
You know, back in Nebraska,

12:48.686 --> 12:51.397
I raised all our baby pigs right until
the day they were slaughtered.

12:51.564 --> 12:55.401
So, unless your baby's
made of breakfast meat, she's fine.

12:59.113 --> 13:00.448
Would you ever get a vasectomy?

13:00.906 --> 13:04.243
Uh, in case you haven't noticed,
Indians aren't too big on birth control.

13:06.036 --> 13:07.371
There's probably, like,
a million more of us

13:07.455 --> 13:08.581
since we started this conversation.

13:12.668 --> 13:14.295
- You okay?
- No.

13:14.503 --> 13:18.924
No. All these comments online about Wil,
they're nothing but supportive and kind.

13:20.301 --> 13:21.719
Where's the mean, snarky Internet

13:21.802 --> 13:23.220
that shows up every time
I get a haircut?

13:25.556 --> 13:26.682
You know that's us, right?

13:30.728 --> 13:32.980
Well, luckily, I got the number
of the company

13:33.063 --> 13:34.106
who's trying to reboot the show,

13:34.356 --> 13:36.650
so I need you all to call
and register your displeasure.

13:37.151 --> 13:38.235
Sheldon, no one's gonna do that.

13:38.402 --> 13:41.155
Not true. I know of three calls
they've received already.

13:41.322 --> 13:42.740
A southern gentleman,

13:42.990 --> 13:45.075
um, a Cockney chimney sweep,

13:45.951 --> 13:47.912
and Mr. T. Hm.

13:48.871 --> 13:51.957
Who, spoiler alert, pities the fool
who tries to reboot that show.

13:53.709 --> 13:56.420
What about "tiresome lunatic with
a bad haircut"? Has he called yet?

13:57.922 --> 13:58.923
Come on!

13:59.006 --> 14:02.134
How many times have we banded together
to try to save a show that we loved?

14:02.301 --> 14:04.803
Let's shake things up
and try to kill one.

14:06.096 --> 14:07.264
Isn't the important thing

14:07.348 --> 14:09.558
that there's a show
to get kids excited about science?

14:10.059 --> 14:11.936
Who cares about kids and what they like?

14:12.603 --> 14:16.440
This is about me and something I liked
when I was a kid.

14:18.442 --> 14:19.818
What if the reboot is great?

14:20.402 --> 14:21.529
That's even worse.

14:21.612 --> 14:24.406
If-if I like it, I'll feel like
I'm being disloyal to Arthur.

14:24.865 --> 14:26.659
He was a mentor and a friend,

14:26.867 --> 14:30.287
and I won't toss him aside for some
Hollywood pretty boy like Wil Wheaton.

14:32.414 --> 14:33.457
It's hard to argue with him.

14:33.541 --> 14:34.875
Because he makes no sense? Yeah.

14:38.337 --> 14:39.547
It's actually kind of nice,

14:40.047 --> 14:42.925
you and me getting to spend
a couple days in bed together.

14:43.425 --> 14:46.470
Yeah. Pretty soon, we're gonna have
two crying babies in the house.

14:47.638 --> 14:49.598
I'm glad my balls hurt.
It's all their fault.

14:52.643 --> 14:55.646
Well, let's just enjoy this quiet time
while we still got it.

14:55.813 --> 14:57.106
Yeah.

14:58.857 --> 15:00.859
Yeah, it is really quiet.

15:01.694 --> 15:03.112
You think Penny's doing okay?

15:04.363 --> 15:06.407
Penny? Everything all right?

15:09.410 --> 15:11.704
Hey, all good. Dipped her pacifier
in a little bourbon,

15:11.787 --> 15:12.788
she conked right out.

15:15.958 --> 15:16.959
I hope you're joking.

15:17.251 --> 15:19.461
Of course, I'm joking.
I don't share my bourbon.

15:22.548 --> 15:23.799
She's joking.

15:23.882 --> 15:25.551
Definitely.

15:26.760 --> 15:27.845
Probably.

15:31.890 --> 15:34.059
Wil Wheaton. Wil Wheaton.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.437
This is Sheldon, by the way.

15:39.481 --> 15:40.649
Hi, Sheldon.

15:40.858 --> 15:43.152
Here I found this pizza flyer
in your fence.

15:44.278 --> 15:46.488
- Thank you.
- Okay, now you owe me a favor.

15:48.532 --> 15:50.534
Turn down the role of Professor Proton.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.286
I don't think so.

15:52.745 --> 15:55.623
You can't be Professor Proton.
You're not a scientist.

15:55.914 --> 15:57.249
Well, I was never on a starship,

15:57.333 --> 15:59.168
but pretending I was
bought me this house.

16:00.085 --> 16:02.755
And if I'd pretended a little longer,
it would have a swimming pool.

16:04.381 --> 16:05.924
Yeah, some things shouldn't be rebooted.

16:06.300 --> 16:08.010
Some things were perfect
the way they were.

16:08.218 --> 16:10.012
Uh,
like the walled city of York?

16:10.095 --> 16:11.889
It was a delight. But New York?

16:13.766 --> 16:16.602
Did you ever consider that
maybe Arthur would be happy

16:16.685 --> 16:18.354
to know that his show has outlived him?

16:19.146 --> 16:21.065
I doubt it.
He was kind of a mean old crank.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.151
Sheldon,

16:24.234 --> 16:27.446
I promise that I will work my hardest
to make this show great,

16:27.863 --> 16:30.074
so that a whole new generation of kids
will grow up

16:30.324 --> 16:31.492
and they will be able to say that

16:31.575 --> 16:34.495
Professor Proton was the reason
they got into science.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.164
Wow.

16:37.873 --> 16:39.458
That was very persuasive.

16:40.042 --> 16:41.043
Thanks.

16:41.293 --> 16:43.337
But I won't be seduced
by your acting skills

16:43.420 --> 16:44.922
nor your movie star charisma.

16:47.383 --> 16:48.926
There's only one Professor Proton

16:49.009 --> 16:50.427
and he had neither of those things.

16:51.929 --> 16:53.806
I'll give you one more chance
to bow out.

16:55.057 --> 16:56.058
Or what?

16:58.102 --> 16:59.770
When we first met, we were enemies.

17:00.312 --> 17:03.023
But we worked through that
and we became friends.

17:03.816 --> 17:05.192
Do you really wanna go back?

17:05.984 --> 17:08.320
Honestly, it doesn't feel
very different.

17:12.491 --> 17:13.826
I'm not leaving.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.869
<i>All right,
I'm gonna sic my dog on you.</i>

17:17.454 --> 17:18.664
You don't have a dog.

17:19.248 --> 17:20.332
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

17:21.458 --> 17:23.669
Oh, I can't tell if you're lying.
You're such a good actor.

17:28.674 --> 17:30.008
Hey, how you doing?

17:30.217 --> 17:31.510
What are you doing here?

17:32.052 --> 17:35.097
Oh, I just came by, you know,
to see if you need any help.

17:36.849 --> 17:38.434
Howard and Bernadette
asked you to check up on me.

17:38.809 --> 17:40.894
That is not entirely true.

17:41.019 --> 17:43.147
So did Leonard and everybody.

17:44.857 --> 17:46.942
How irresponsible do you all think I am?

17:47.109 --> 17:49.153
We don't think you're irresponsible.

17:49.319 --> 17:50.320
We think you're

17:51.280 --> 17:52.364
fun-loving.

17:53.490 --> 17:55.534
That is just a nice word
for irresponsible.

17:56.452 --> 17:58.871
Hmm, you might be more on the ball
than we thought.

18:02.750 --> 18:03.876
I'm getting a little hungry.

18:04.376 --> 18:06.587
- Want me to get it this time?
- Oh, that'd be great.

18:11.216 --> 18:12.301
This is fun.

18:12.593 --> 18:15.512
And now you also get to see
an annoyed blonde walk into the room.

18:17.681 --> 18:18.682
What?

18:20.184 --> 18:21.435
Can you get us a little snack?

18:21.727 --> 18:23.562
Are you sure you don't want
your spy to do it?

18:24.438 --> 18:25.481
What are you talking about?

18:25.606 --> 18:27.858
You really don't trust me?
You had to have Amy stop by?

18:28.317 --> 18:29.359
We trust you.

18:29.651 --> 18:31.612
Yeah, you were a terrible waitress

18:31.695 --> 18:33.322
and we still asked you
to get us a snack.

18:37.493 --> 18:39.495
Excuse me, while I go
take care of your baby.

18:39.620 --> 18:41.955
Then I'll bring you your snack
and you can insult me some more.

18:44.333 --> 18:45.501
I don't know about you,

18:45.709 --> 18:47.711
but I am not eating
whatever she brings us.

18:49.880 --> 18:53.008
<i>Hey, Halley! Oh, it's okay,
Aunty Penny's here.</i>

18:53.091 --> 18:55.219
<i>Shh. Let's get you changed.</i>

18:55.552 --> 18:57.429
<i>Your mommy and daddy say they trust me,</i>

18:57.554 --> 18:59.932
<i>but they're full of the same stuff
your diaper is.</i>

19:02.351 --> 19:03.519
Now I feel bad.

19:03.769 --> 19:05.646
Well, she never really liked me.

19:05.729 --> 19:07.272
It's kind of nice
she hates you now, too.

19:08.524 --> 19:10.150
<i>Oh, but I'm here for you,</i>

19:10.234 --> 19:11.985
<i>and I would never let
anything happen to you</i>

19:12.069 --> 19:15.239
<i>because your Aunty Penny
loves you so much.</i>

19:15.405 --> 19:16.490
<i>Mama.</i>

19:24.373 --> 19:25.582
Was that her first word?

19:25.666 --> 19:26.750
<i>Mama.</i>

19:29.127 --> 19:31.296
<i>No, no, baby, I'm not your mama.</i>

19:31.547 --> 19:33.966
<i>Your mama's the nice lady
we're gonna go see right now</i>

19:34.049 --> 19:35.843
<i>so I can rub this in her face.</i>

19:37.970 --> 19:40.597
<i>Do you hear that, suckers?
She called me "Mama."</i>

19:56.780 --> 19:57.865
Hello, Arthur.

19:58.907 --> 19:59.908
You know,

20:01.201 --> 20:04.705
we could, we could also meet in a deli.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.252
I'm sorry to say that I failed you.

20:10.627 --> 20:13.589
I tried to stop Wil Wheaton
being Professor Proton,

20:13.714 --> 20:14.715
but I couldn't.

20:15.507 --> 20:17.885
See, now, that's the kind of thing

20:18.343 --> 20:20.721
you could tell a fella over a

20:22.347 --> 20:23.640
pastrami sandwich.

20:28.896 --> 20:30.314
Well, don't worry,

20:30.439 --> 20:32.816
he's now on my enemies list forever.

20:32.900 --> 20:34.484
He's totally cut off.

20:34.860 --> 20:36.028
Interesting.

20:36.570 --> 20:39.781
Can anyone
sign up for that list?

21:10.854 --> 21:11.855
English - SDH
