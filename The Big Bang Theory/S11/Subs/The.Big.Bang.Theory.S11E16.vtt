WEBVTT

00:11.971 --> 00:14.182
Howie? Howie, wake up.

00:14.307 --> 00:15.475
It's time.

00:15.892 --> 00:18.353
- Did your water break?
- No.

00:18.812 --> 00:20.188
Are you feeling any contractions?

00:20.271 --> 00:21.481
No.

00:22.315 --> 00:23.817
Wait. Well, where are you going?

00:23.900 --> 00:24.984
To the hospital.

00:25.068 --> 00:28.279
Today's my due date,
and this crap needs to end now.

00:30.073 --> 00:33.702
Honey, babies don't
always come on their due date.

00:33.785 --> 00:35.829
Halley was two weeks late.

00:37.247 --> 00:39.457
But this baby's a boy.

00:39.582 --> 00:41.668
They don't take as long to get ready.

00:43.253 --> 00:44.254
What are you doing?

00:44.337 --> 00:47.132
I'm making the situation better
with humor.

00:47.716 --> 00:48.717
Are you?

00:50.301 --> 00:52.804
Would you rather me
make it better with magic?

00:53.304 --> 00:55.014
- Go back to sleep.
- Ta-da!

01:04.065 --> 01:06.317
You know, I hear
that sex can induce labor.

01:06.401 --> 01:08.445
Anything for my family.

01:36.222 --> 01:39.100
I believe today
is Bernadette's due date.

01:39.309 --> 01:40.351
Yeah.

01:40.435 --> 01:41.603
How do you know that?

01:41.770 --> 01:44.522
Easy. 40 weeks from the date
of her last period.

01:46.524 --> 01:48.651
And why do you know that?

01:48.902 --> 01:52.071
Well, excuse me for taking
an interest in people.

01:53.740 --> 01:56.409
- So, any day now.
- Oh, I don't know.

01:56.493 --> 01:57.494
We went to the doctor this morning,

01:57.577 --> 01:59.454
and she said it could still
be another week or two.

02:00.038 --> 02:01.289
How's Bernadette holding up?

02:01.414 --> 02:03.374
It's pretty rough.

02:03.500 --> 02:05.335
She's having a hard time.

02:08.379 --> 02:09.506
Why are you smiling?

02:09.589 --> 02:11.549
I had sex twice last night.

02:11.883 --> 02:13.927
That's not fair! She's on bed rest.

02:14.010 --> 02:15.595
She can't run away.

02:16.679 --> 02:17.806
It was her idea.

02:17.889 --> 02:19.641
She read that it can start labor.

02:19.849 --> 02:21.100
Mm, is that true?

02:21.184 --> 02:24.395
Well, I would have googled it,
but I was busy taking my pants off.

02:26.815 --> 02:29.317
Yeah, not to brag,
but Amy's last birthday

02:29.400 --> 02:32.028
brought my coital tally up to four.

02:33.112 --> 02:35.323
Whatever you're doing,
it's not bragging.

02:36.866 --> 02:38.076
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

02:38.159 --> 02:39.911
Hey, I was just talking about you.

02:40.036 --> 02:42.205
- Oh, should I ask?
- You should not.

02:43.873 --> 02:45.708
I'm trying to get
our grant proposal together.

02:45.792 --> 02:47.585
Any chance you've finished up
those mechanical drawings?

02:48.044 --> 02:50.505
Sorry. I was gonna do it last night,
but I got kind of busy.

02:50.588 --> 02:52.173
Yeah, you did.

02:54.342 --> 02:55.718
What are they talking about?

02:55.802 --> 02:56.886
I'll give you a hint.

02:57.011 --> 02:59.973
It's something
that we have done four times.

03:00.598 --> 03:01.975
Watched <i>La La Land?</i>

03:02.058 --> 03:04.269
What? No. No.

03:04.352 --> 03:06.646
I've not watched <i>La La Land</i> four times.

03:07.146 --> 03:08.606
If you find the soundtrack on my phone,

03:08.690 --> 03:10.859
that's just 'cause
our iTunes accounts are linked.

03:12.986 --> 03:14.279
Looks like I might have
a little more time

03:14.362 --> 03:15.488
before the baby gets here,

03:15.572 --> 03:17.448
so why don't we just stay late
and get it done?

03:17.657 --> 03:19.242
Well, I don't want you
to leave Bernadette alone.

03:19.325 --> 03:21.327
Oh, we can hang out
and keep her company.

03:21.411 --> 03:23.580
- Yeah, absolutely.
- See, see. Look at my Netflix queue.

03:23.663 --> 03:26.165
There's two documentaries
and the movie <i>Friends with Benefits,</i>

03:26.416 --> 03:27.792
which I thought was a documentary

03:27.876 --> 03:30.003
about employer health care plans.

03:32.797 --> 03:34.799
Hey, Bernie, it's me.

03:34.924 --> 03:36.593
I let myself in.

03:37.010 --> 03:38.344
Hey.

03:39.262 --> 03:40.388
What are you doing?

03:40.471 --> 03:42.056
I thought you were supposed
to be on bed rest.

03:42.140 --> 03:43.975
That's done, but I've been on stair rest

03:44.058 --> 03:45.894
for the last 45 minutes.

03:46.436 --> 03:48.146
- Here, let me help you.
- Yeah.

03:48.229 --> 03:50.106
If you really want to help,
put on a rubber glove,

03:50.189 --> 03:52.191
reach on up there and start pulling.

03:53.109 --> 03:54.819
I know you're joking,
but I grew up on a farm.

03:54.903 --> 03:56.154
I'll do it.

03:56.362 --> 03:58.740
Uh, I just want this to be over.

03:59.157 --> 04:00.825
You know, when
my yoga instructor was pregnant,

04:00.909 --> 04:02.327
she told me there are tons of poses

04:02.410 --> 04:03.661
that put her right into labor.

04:03.828 --> 04:04.871
I'll try,

04:04.954 --> 04:08.082
but I feel like bendy poses
are what got me into this mess.

04:10.084 --> 04:13.212
Okay, we're gonna start with
some nice breathing exercises.

04:15.381 --> 04:18.051
Sorry. I can't think of anything
except how flat your belly is.

04:19.928 --> 04:21.304
Oh, thank you.

04:22.096 --> 04:24.349
Go put on some more clothes, you bitch.

04:29.354 --> 04:31.981
Okay, we go down

04:33.191 --> 04:34.817
and back up.

04:38.696 --> 04:40.031
And back up!

04:40.114 --> 04:42.450
Yeah, hearing you is not the problem.

04:45.161 --> 04:47.497
- Hey, put that phone away!
- Smile.

04:50.291 --> 04:52.627
I'm telling you,
there's an acupressure point

04:52.710 --> 04:55.588
right above your ankle
that can induce contractions.

04:55.713 --> 04:57.507
All right, but just a warning.

04:57.715 --> 04:59.008
My feet are a little swollen.

04:59.092 --> 05:02.679
Oh, please, Bernadette.
I'm sure this... Okay.

05:04.514 --> 05:05.598
- What?
- Nothing.

05:05.682 --> 05:08.309
Your ankles look fine, and not at all

05:08.393 --> 05:10.812
like I just popped open
a can of crescent rolls.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.817
My mother believes that if
you're not prepared mentally,

05:15.900 --> 05:17.694
it can delay your body
from going into labor.

05:18.111 --> 05:20.154
So what are you trying to say?
It's my fault?

05:23.324 --> 05:26.285
Raj is crazy.
Your ankles aren't that gross.

05:32.375 --> 05:33.418
Hello.

05:33.501 --> 05:36.379
Let me guess. You're here to
try to get me to go into labor.

05:36.504 --> 05:39.882
Oh, please. I'm disgusted
when people sneeze,

05:39.966 --> 05:41.718
and that's just stuff
coming out of their nose.

05:43.219 --> 05:46.848
No. I am here to sit with you
and keep you company.

05:47.181 --> 05:48.391
Oh, that's nice.

05:48.474 --> 05:51.436
Yeah, by playing
the most complicated board game

05:51.519 --> 05:54.689
ever invented <i>Campaign for North Africa.</i>

05:56.733 --> 05:58.026
I bought it off eBay.

05:58.109 --> 06:00.987
It smells a little like chili,
but all the pieces are there.

06:03.031 --> 06:04.198
Come on, baby.

06:04.282 --> 06:06.534
Get out here right now,
and I'll buy you a pony.

06:10.705 --> 06:13.041
Are there any engineers
on the grant committee?

06:13.166 --> 06:14.250
I don't know. Why?

06:14.333 --> 06:17.045
I didn't have time to figure out
the three-input hydraulic manifold,

06:17.128 --> 06:19.338
so this diagram is really just
a flux capacitor

06:19.422 --> 06:20.882
from <i>Back to the Future.</i>

06:22.717 --> 06:24.802
I'm sorry this is on such short notice.

06:24.886 --> 06:27.388
Hey, I just wish I could be
there when you present it.

06:27.764 --> 06:28.806
That's okay.

06:28.890 --> 06:30.808
It's more important that
you spend time with Michael.

06:31.517 --> 06:32.935
Who's Michael?

06:34.145 --> 06:35.938
Uh, your son?

06:36.022 --> 06:37.106
No, it's not.

06:37.190 --> 06:39.025
My son doesn't have a name yet.

06:43.237 --> 06:45.615
Okay, well, then, Bernadette's son.

06:47.158 --> 06:48.242
I can't believe her.

06:48.326 --> 06:51.454
She knows I don't want
to name the baby after her dad.

06:51.579 --> 06:54.040
- What did you want to name him?
- I don't know.

06:54.123 --> 06:56.209
We were gonna wait until
we saw what he looked like.

06:56.292 --> 06:57.877
Well, it's a baby.

06:58.169 --> 07:01.547
Her dad's a wrinkly bald man.
That wasn't gonna break your way.

07:11.224 --> 07:12.683
Oh, come on!

07:15.561 --> 07:18.564
Welcome to the next five to
eight weeks of your life.

07:19.774 --> 07:22.110
Sheldon, I said
I didn't want to play your game.

07:22.401 --> 07:24.112
Well, then don't think of it as a game.

07:24.195 --> 07:26.948
Think of it as a source of information

07:27.031 --> 07:30.618
about one of the lesser known
campaigns of World War II.

07:31.994 --> 07:33.704
You're right. That's so much better.

07:34.664 --> 07:36.124
I know, right?

07:36.415 --> 07:39.544
Okay, first, we need to roll
to determine the weather.

07:39.794 --> 07:42.171
It's a desert. Isn't it gonna be hot?

07:58.146 --> 07:59.188
Yes.

08:02.942 --> 08:05.778
Michael? Really, you think
we're naming him Michael?

08:06.237 --> 08:09.031
Not now, Howard.
I'm in the middle of a game.

08:10.741 --> 08:13.536
You wish. You are hundreds
of hours away from the middle.

08:20.376 --> 08:23.838
I can't believe you're trying
to hijack our son's name.

08:24.255 --> 08:25.882
Bernie?

08:27.925 --> 08:30.887
This is as fast as I
move! Calm down!

08:38.519 --> 08:40.771
So you're just gonna name him Michael?

08:40.855 --> 08:42.481
Were you even gonna tell me?

08:42.565 --> 08:43.900
I told you.

08:43.983 --> 08:45.151
When?

08:45.443 --> 08:46.819
Oh, right. That was Amy.

08:49.780 --> 08:52.158
What's wrong with Michael?
It's my dad's name.

08:52.366 --> 08:55.745
I don't want to name our son
after your father.

08:58.706 --> 09:01.417
I didn't want to say this,
but he's dying.

09:02.877 --> 09:04.003
He is?

09:04.629 --> 09:07.632
Eventually. I mean, you
see the way the man eats.

09:08.591 --> 09:10.301
Okay, is this the hormones,

09:10.384 --> 09:12.678
or have you always been a lunatic?

09:14.430 --> 09:15.890
I don't even know anymore.

09:17.850 --> 09:20.061
Bernie, this is our kid's name.

09:20.186 --> 09:22.772
I think we should both agree.

09:22.980 --> 09:25.191
You're right. We both made this baby.

09:25.691 --> 09:26.776
Thank you.

09:27.109 --> 09:29.237
And I carried it, had to
stay in bed for four months,

09:29.320 --> 09:30.571
sacrificed my body and my job,

09:30.655 --> 09:32.448
and soon it's gonna
burst its way out of me

09:32.531 --> 09:34.242
like the Kool-Aid Man.

09:36.369 --> 09:37.703
Exactly. Fifty-fifty.

09:42.166 --> 09:44.543
I think I got Bernadette in trouble.
Maybe we should go.

09:45.086 --> 09:46.128
I can't.

09:46.212 --> 09:48.714
She and I are playing
<i>Campaign for North Africa.</i>

09:50.132 --> 09:52.260
She doesn't want to play that.

09:52.510 --> 09:55.638
Neither did the Egyptians,
but that didn't stop Rommel.

09:57.056 --> 09:59.350
Hey! I brought Chinese.

09:59.433 --> 10:00.977
And I brought Indian.

10:02.728 --> 10:04.105
What are you guys doing here?

10:04.188 --> 10:07.275
Sheldon texted and said
Bernadette wanted us all to come over.

10:10.486 --> 10:13.281
The game's best with
five to ten players.

10:16.158 --> 10:18.828
Okay, if it's not Michael, then
what do you want to name him?

10:19.036 --> 10:22.373
Harry, like Potter or Houdini.

10:23.958 --> 10:26.210
It doesn't bother you that I have
an old boyfriend named Harry?

10:27.545 --> 10:29.130
Okay.

10:30.298 --> 10:32.883
How about AI or Max or

10:33.134 --> 10:34.593
Ted or Kevin?

10:35.261 --> 10:36.637
Same answer.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.265
Hey, Bernadette, it's your turn.

10:39.348 --> 10:43.185
Uh, Penny's air force
is strafing your supply line in Tobruk.

10:44.061 --> 10:45.313
We're kind of busy.

10:45.396 --> 10:47.898
Oh, okay. But you're being pretty rude.

10:47.982 --> 10:50.276
Everyone did come over
to play this game with you.

10:53.154 --> 10:55.740
You know, I always thought
Christian was a nice name.

10:56.157 --> 10:59.410
I don't know.
Sounds a little too uncircumcised.

11:01.454 --> 11:03.080
Bernadette, it's your turn.

11:03.164 --> 11:04.290
What about Greg?

11:04.373 --> 11:05.958
All right, I'll just roll for you.

11:07.418 --> 11:09.170
Oh, that is a good one!

11:09.253 --> 11:11.672
Your troops' morale rating
is pretty high.

11:11.756 --> 11:13.382
Now, Leonard, as the defender,

11:13.466 --> 11:15.343
we need to subtract your morale rating

11:15.509 --> 11:16.927
from Bernadette's to get a final

11:17.011 --> 11:18.846
adjusted morale rating for the assault.

11:18.929 --> 11:21.974
And I will just check
the assault differential column.

11:22.183 --> 11:24.310
Oh, who said war was hell?

11:25.061 --> 11:28.272
Yeah, that's a rhetorical question.
Sherman said it.

11:28.397 --> 11:29.565
What about Sherman?

11:29.648 --> 11:31.150
Like, Sherman Wolowitz.

11:31.233 --> 11:34.028
Yeah, that's a kid who's gonna
take his mother to prom.

11:36.322 --> 11:37.990
Hey, Howard, you did that, right?

11:40.242 --> 11:42.286
I didn't take her. She chaperoned.

11:42.953 --> 11:44.830
We slow-danced once.

11:46.791 --> 11:48.000
What about Paul?

11:48.834 --> 11:51.253
Paul. Paul Wolowitz.

11:51.337 --> 11:52.380
I like it.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.298
Like "Koothra-Paul-i."

11:56.300 --> 11:58.135
Okay, you ruined it.

11:59.345 --> 12:02.264
All right, that moves us on
to the tactical shipping phase.

12:02.348 --> 12:05.184
Penny, I believe,
as logistics commander, that's you.

12:05.518 --> 12:07.937
- Okay. I surrender.
- Uh...

12:08.771 --> 12:10.022
Nice try, Penny.

12:10.106 --> 12:12.233
It takes more
than everybody not enjoying it

12:12.316 --> 12:14.110
to stop a game with Sheldon Cooper.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.571
Sheldon, we're talking
about something important here.

12:17.655 --> 12:21.242
Fine. If you pick a baby name,
can we get back to playing?

12:21.492 --> 12:23.202
- Sure.
- All right, here we go.

12:23.536 --> 12:25.121
Ranatanata.

12:26.831 --> 12:28.707
You can't name him Ranatanata.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.419
Oh, right, it's a boy.
That'd be ridiculous.

12:32.044 --> 12:34.380
What about Ozymandias?

12:35.589 --> 12:37.967
Are you making these up
or having a stroke?

12:39.218 --> 12:42.346
Ozymandias is from a poem
by Percy Bysshe Shelley.

12:42.430 --> 12:45.516
Oh! Oh! Bysshe Wolowitz.
Solved. Back to the game.

12:47.268 --> 12:49.728
Heyo! Sandstorm!

12:51.313 --> 12:53.732
Uh, some people name their
kids after places.

12:53.816 --> 12:56.485
Like what, Walla Walla Wolowitz?

12:58.779 --> 13:01.282
If you think that is better
than Ozymandias Wolowitz,

13:01.365 --> 13:03.075
then you have been breathing in
the poisonous gas

13:03.159 --> 13:04.743
that my troops illegally dispersed.

13:05.619 --> 13:06.871
Oh...

13:07.121 --> 13:09.790
- You okay?
- I think that was a contraction.

13:09.957 --> 13:12.126
Is it time? Do we need
to go to the hospital?

13:12.209 --> 13:13.294
No. We've been through this before.

13:13.377 --> 13:14.837
My water hasn't even broken yet.

13:15.171 --> 13:16.589
Never mind your water.

13:16.672 --> 13:18.674
Has your mucus plug popped out?

13:20.217 --> 13:21.552
Ew, no!

13:21.719 --> 13:23.888
Oh, you're right.
We probably would've heard that.

13:24.180 --> 13:25.848
It's not a champagne cork.

13:25.931 --> 13:28.100
Although that would be festive.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.228
You know what, maybe we should go.

13:31.312 --> 13:32.855
Did you have another contraction?

13:32.938 --> 13:34.565
No. I'm just worried
that Sheldon's gonna say

13:34.648 --> 13:36.358
"mucus plug" again.

13:37.443 --> 13:39.820
And I'm worried
one's gonna hit me in the eye.

13:40.529 --> 13:41.697
Yep, it's time.

13:41.780 --> 13:42.823
Should we take two cars?

13:42.907 --> 13:45.159
Uh, actually, could you
stay here and watch Halley?

13:45.242 --> 13:47.286
That way we don't have to wait
for Bernadette's parents.

13:47.369 --> 13:48.621
Yeah, you guys go.
We'll take care of her.

13:48.704 --> 13:49.955
You have nothing to worry about.

13:50.039 --> 13:51.499
Uh... Well, not nothing.

13:51.582 --> 13:54.752
There are U-boats approaching
the Suez Canal.

13:55.586 --> 13:58.464
It's too late for us. Go, go!
Save yourselves!

13:59.423 --> 14:02.760
Suez? Birth?
It's a big night for canals.

14:07.932 --> 14:09.266
How you feeling?

14:09.600 --> 14:10.851
Eh...

14:11.268 --> 14:13.896
But I am really excited to meet our son.

14:14.063 --> 14:16.982
Me, too. I thought
I'd be super freaked out.

14:17.066 --> 14:20.277
But I'm ready for this.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.655
Well, not the part where you're in labor

14:22.738 --> 14:25.032
and you squeeze my fingers
till they turn blue.

14:25.950 --> 14:27.201
I'm sorry.

14:27.284 --> 14:29.870
That must be really painful for you.

14:32.164 --> 14:33.958
It is. I mean, last time, I...

14:34.041 --> 14:36.210
Oh, okay, I see what you're doing.

14:40.339 --> 14:41.674
It's a big one.

14:42.383 --> 14:43.676
Just breathe.

14:45.469 --> 14:47.054
Okay.

14:47.388 --> 14:49.223
Okay, I'm good.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.185
I'm sorry I tried
to sneak the name past you.

14:53.352 --> 14:54.520
That's okay.

14:54.812 --> 14:57.648
I'm sorry I used up
so many good names in college.

15:00.484 --> 15:02.987
I was really competitive
with my roommate.

15:05.406 --> 15:06.991
Forget about it.

15:07.449 --> 15:09.034
Please.

15:11.787 --> 15:13.914
You know what, maybe we're putting
too much pressure on this.

15:13.998 --> 15:15.583
It doesn't matter what we name him.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.042
He's gonna be amazing.

15:17.251 --> 15:18.586
You're right.

15:18.919 --> 15:21.547
This kid is part you and part me.

15:21.880 --> 15:25.801
Yeah. He's gonna be smart
and kind and funny.

15:25.884 --> 15:28.721
If he cracks five-foot-six,
it'll be a miracle.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.600
I've always liked the name Elliott.

15:32.683 --> 15:34.768
Sorry, can't have it.
That's my boy name.

15:35.269 --> 15:36.604
I said it first.

15:36.687 --> 15:38.480
It's not like calling dibs.

15:38.606 --> 15:40.357
Yes, it is. It's exactly like that.

15:40.441 --> 15:42.109
Dibs on Elliott.

15:42.443 --> 15:45.195
I'm just saying,
we might get there first.

15:45.279 --> 15:46.614
You only have sex once a year.

15:46.697 --> 15:48.574
I'll probably have sex tonight.

15:50.618 --> 15:52.745
Fine, you can have Elliott.

15:54.204 --> 15:55.998
When did you pick out our kids' names?

15:56.081 --> 15:58.125
Remember that day
you moved into the building?

15:58.459 --> 15:59.877
Yes.

16:01.378 --> 16:04.590
A non-creepy amount of time after that.

16:06.175 --> 16:07.676
Yeah, I like the name Elliott.

16:07.760 --> 16:09.511
That wasn't on my list, but I like it.

16:09.678 --> 16:12.598
We've heard your names.
They're ridiculous.

16:12.890 --> 16:14.975
And I have a cousin named Dilip.

16:15.726 --> 16:18.354
Well, I wasn't going to give
them any of the good names.

16:18.437 --> 16:19.897
I'm saving those for us.

16:20.648 --> 16:23.025
Really? You've thought about our kids?

16:23.359 --> 16:26.403
Of course. I think you and I
will have exceptional children.

16:27.321 --> 16:30.449
Oh... Well, I think so, too.

16:30.616 --> 16:32.117
How many kids do you guys want?

16:32.451 --> 16:34.244
- Fifteen.
- Two.

16:36.455 --> 16:37.998
- What?
- Well, don't worry.

16:38.082 --> 16:39.875
I don't expect you to bear them all.

16:39.958 --> 16:43.128
I'm sure we can find a
suitable uterus to rent.

16:44.588 --> 16:46.465
- No!
- Uh-huh!

16:47.800 --> 16:49.051
We weren't thinking about you.

16:49.134 --> 16:50.177
Of course not.

16:50.260 --> 16:52.096
I am going to the kitchen.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.555
Can I get anybody anything?

16:53.722 --> 16:56.308
Penny, nice glass of milk
and a multivitamin?

17:08.487 --> 17:09.905
Guys.

17:10.239 --> 17:12.366
Guys, wake up. Terrible news.

17:12.449 --> 17:13.575
Oh, my God. What, what, what?

17:13.659 --> 17:15.994
- Is it the baby?
- No. No, no, we miscalculated

17:16.078 --> 17:17.538
our unassigned armor class units.

17:17.621 --> 17:19.039
We need to start over.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.251
- What?
- No, no, no, not from the beginning.

17:22.334 --> 17:23.877
Just from when the tanks started moving.

17:24.712 --> 17:26.505
That was five hours ago.

17:27.339 --> 17:31.427
No. No, that was two hours ago.
It only feels like five.

17:32.136 --> 17:34.263
- What time is it?
- It's almost 2:30.

17:34.513 --> 17:35.806
Don't you think
we should've heard something?

17:35.889 --> 17:38.434
- I'm sure they're fine.
- I'm calling them.

17:41.770 --> 17:42.771
<i>Hey!</i>

17:42.855 --> 17:43.939
Hey, everything okay?

17:44.022 --> 17:47.276
<i>Yeah! The baby was born
about an hour ago.</i>

17:47.943 --> 17:50.070
Dude, why didn't you call me?

17:50.863 --> 17:53.323
<i>The only way I would
see my son for the first time</i>

17:53.407 --> 17:55.367
<i>and immediately think
"I need to call Raj"</i>

17:55.451 --> 17:57.244
<i>is if he came out brown.</i>

17:59.455 --> 18:01.623
You know, it can take some time
for pigment to form.

18:01.707 --> 18:03.459
You're still not out of the woods.

18:03.584 --> 18:06.170
- Well, congratulations! Yeah.
- Hey, what'd you name him?

18:06.462 --> 18:07.796
<i>Neil Michael.</i>

18:07.921 --> 18:09.798
<i>Neil for Armstrong,</i>

18:09.923 --> 18:11.383
<i>Gaiman, and Diamond.</i>

18:11.508 --> 18:14.636
<i>Michael because Bernie
had to get six stitches.</i>

18:15.345 --> 18:16.847
Neil. That's cute.

18:17.055 --> 18:18.807
<i>But we're calling
him Michael!</i>

18:19.349 --> 18:21.185
<i>I'm not gonna fight her.</i>

18:21.268 --> 18:23.604
<i>That kid's head was the size
of a cantaloupe.</i>

18:50.756 --> 18:51.757
English - SDH
