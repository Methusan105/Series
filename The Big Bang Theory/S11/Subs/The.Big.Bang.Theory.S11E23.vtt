WEBVTT

00:03.630 --> 00:04.631
That's not right.

00:05.215 --> 00:07.300
No, that's so unreasonable.

00:07.634 --> 00:08.843
Yeah, well,
if you're going to be like this

00:08.927 --> 00:10.720
then I don't wanna talk to you
right now either.

00:11.388 --> 00:12.681
Okay, I love you. Bye.

00:14.557 --> 00:15.975
Amazon customer support?

00:18.144 --> 00:19.396
No, my mother.

00:19.479 --> 00:22.190
Guess who she's insisting
we invite to our wedding.

00:22.649 --> 00:23.650
Jesus?

00:24.693 --> 00:26.820
If only. My brother.

00:27.946 --> 00:31.366
Wait a minute. You didn't invite
your brother to your own wedding?

00:31.616 --> 00:33.868
He tormented me my whole childhood.

00:34.119 --> 00:36.287
I don't think
I should reward that type of behavior

00:36.371 --> 00:39.124
with a slice of wedding cake
in the shape of the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

00:40.625 --> 00:41.626
Try again.

00:41.835 --> 00:44.129
A slice of wedding cake
in the shape of a cake.

00:46.381 --> 00:48.425
Look, he may have been mean to you
when you were kids,

00:48.550 --> 00:50.301
but you're both grown men now.

00:50.385 --> 00:51.511
That's right.

00:51.678 --> 00:55.098
I'm a grown-up and if I don't wanna
invite him to my wedding then I won't.

00:55.974 --> 00:57.392
- Okay.
- Except I have to,

00:57.475 --> 00:59.227
'cause my mommy's making me.

01:26.588 --> 01:29.591
Okay, so each welcome bag
gets a schedule of events,

01:29.674 --> 01:31.384
a map, and chocolate from me.

01:31.634 --> 01:34.262
And from Sheldon, a bottle of Purell,

01:35.889 --> 01:37.474
the number for Poison Control,

01:37.557 --> 01:39.642
in case someone
accidentally drinks the Purell,

01:40.769 --> 01:42.771
and a laminated table of elements

01:42.854 --> 01:45.356
because the American school system
is a failure.

01:47.108 --> 01:49.027
How many out-of-town guests
are there gonna be?

01:49.152 --> 01:50.278
I'm actually not sure.

01:50.361 --> 01:52.322
Turns out Sheldon
didn't invite his brother.

01:52.655 --> 01:54.616
Um. Now it's starting
to sound like a wedding.

01:55.700 --> 01:58.119
And his mom said she won't come
if his brother's not there.

01:58.369 --> 02:00.163
Um! Now it's starting to sound
like a good wedding.

02:01.748 --> 02:02.749
Hey, Bernie,

02:03.625 --> 02:06.294
how do you know if someone has pink eye?

02:06.753 --> 02:09.798
Um, their eye would be red, swollen,
and probably oozy.

02:10.048 --> 02:11.216
Okay, thanks.

02:11.800 --> 02:13.176
Both kids have pink eye.

02:13.635 --> 02:14.636
Oh, no.

02:14.844 --> 02:16.054
You stop right there!

02:16.387 --> 02:19.057
I'm getting married in a week.
You are not giving me pink eye.

02:19.432 --> 02:21.851
- I don't have pink eye.
- Hey, hey, hey.

02:21.935 --> 02:24.562
Let's step away from the bride!

02:24.771 --> 02:27.190
Okay. I'll go back upstairs.

02:27.398 --> 02:29.692
Get in the shower and then
take those clothes and burn them.

02:29.776 --> 02:31.569
Yeah, and all the rest of your clothes.

02:33.780 --> 02:34.781
Ah, worth a shot.

02:39.244 --> 02:41.746
So, am I gonna be, like, the only
single guy at Sheldon's wedding?

02:42.163 --> 02:44.582
No, there will be
a lot of single people there.

02:44.666 --> 02:46.334
Stuart, Amy's great-aunt...

02:47.794 --> 02:51.714
Although, Stuart's already friended her
on Facebook so better move quick.

02:53.591 --> 02:54.801
I got to find a date.

02:54.884 --> 02:57.762
I don't wanna be that sad single friend
that everyone looks at with pity.

02:57.887 --> 02:58.888
Oh!

02:58.972 --> 03:01.391
I'm afraid that ship
may have sailed.

03:03.643 --> 03:06.729
Leonard, you have a brother, right?

03:06.938 --> 03:08.439
- Yes.
- Is he the worst?

03:08.523 --> 03:10.483
Is he an unspeakable abomination?

03:10.567 --> 03:12.569
Does the very thought of him
make your skin crawl?

03:14.362 --> 03:16.531
He laughs at his own jokes,
but otherwise, he's okay.

03:17.782 --> 03:18.908
Sheldon, what's going on?

03:19.075 --> 03:21.744
I'm trying to invite
my stupid brother to my wedding,

03:21.828 --> 03:23.246
and he's avoiding my calls.

03:23.371 --> 03:24.956
You don't know he's avoiding your calls.

03:29.586 --> 03:32.130
<i>Hey, you've reached
George Cooper, please leave a message.</i>

03:32.213 --> 03:33.548
<i>Unless this is Sheldon again,</i>

03:33.631 --> 03:37.927
<i>in which case, please try me
on my other number, 1-800-suck-it.</i>

03:41.514 --> 03:42.515
See?

03:42.765 --> 03:45.852
And I know that's not a real number
because why would it be toll-free?

03:48.229 --> 03:50.315
Sheldon, you tried.
What more could you have done?

03:50.523 --> 03:52.108
Hey, why didn't you invite him
in the first place?

03:52.358 --> 03:54.694
You don't know what it was like
growing up with him.

03:55.153 --> 03:57.739
I get it, I grew up
with lots of brothers.

03:57.822 --> 03:59.449
My brother, Adoot, was especially mean.

03:59.532 --> 04:01.409
Really? I've never heard you
mention Adoot.

04:01.868 --> 04:02.994
Sure I have.

04:03.077 --> 04:05.246
He's the one who left the door open
when we were kids,

04:05.330 --> 04:07.040
and my pet mongoose ran away.

04:08.666 --> 04:09.667
Stupid Adoot!

04:11.711 --> 04:14.464
Look, short of getting on a plane
and flying there,

04:14.547 --> 04:16.007
what does your mother expect you to do?

04:19.844 --> 04:22.263
I kept saying no, how am I here?

04:25.224 --> 04:26.893
Hey, did I tell you? I found a date.

04:26.976 --> 04:28.728
- To the wedding?
- To coffee.

04:28.811 --> 04:31.105
But if things go well,
Sheldon and Amy's wedding.

04:32.148 --> 04:33.900
Aren't you worried it's a little intense

04:33.983 --> 04:36.444
to ask someone you just met
to go to a wedding?

04:36.903 --> 04:38.655
I'm running out of time.

04:39.072 --> 04:40.323
Why can't there be a service

04:40.406 --> 04:43.368
where you can just pay someone
to be your date for the evening?

04:46.579 --> 04:47.705
Like an escort service?

04:48.122 --> 04:50.458
No, no, no.
You wouldn't be paying for sex.

04:50.708 --> 04:53.252
I mean, obviously if things went well
it could lead to sex,

04:53.336 --> 04:56.714
but the money is for like,
you know, her time and companionship.

04:57.048 --> 04:58.049
Oh! I get it.

04:59.175 --> 05:00.176
An escort service.

05:01.344 --> 05:02.345
Stop saying that.

05:02.553 --> 05:03.554
Stop meaning it.

05:05.348 --> 05:09.227
Hey, Raj, remember when you
borrowed my VR goggles the other day?

05:09.310 --> 05:10.311
Yeah.

05:11.479 --> 05:12.689
Probably shouldn't have done that.

05:19.696 --> 05:22.031
So wait, your brother is Dr. Tire?

05:22.407 --> 05:26.119
Yes, and apparently it only takes
half a semester of community college

05:26.202 --> 05:27.912
to get that particular doctorate.

05:28.538 --> 05:31.249
We passed three of these stores
on the way here.

05:31.332 --> 05:34.168
Why did you say
he's just some loser who sells tires?

05:34.836 --> 05:36.379
You're right, that was unfair.

05:36.462 --> 05:40.299
He is a loser who sells more tires
than anyone in Texas.

05:43.720 --> 05:46.723
Oh, excuse me,
we're looking for a Georgie Cooper.

05:46.931 --> 05:49.142
One second, I'll check to see
if the doctor's in.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.437
He is not a doctor.

05:53.229 --> 05:55.440
Only one doctor here and it's me.

05:56.941 --> 05:58.026
I'm also a doctor.

05:58.109 --> 05:59.235
Do you wanna wait in the car?

06:00.611 --> 06:02.030
I wanted to wait in California.

06:04.657 --> 06:06.284
So, is this Georgie?

06:06.659 --> 06:07.660
Yes.

06:08.286 --> 06:11.789
And what is he even using
that stethoscope to listen to?

06:12.373 --> 06:13.958
I don't know. Small leak?

06:15.793 --> 06:16.878
All right, that makes sense.

06:19.338 --> 06:21.758
What the hell are you doing here?

06:22.050 --> 06:24.385
- Hello, Georgie.
- It's just George now.

06:24.802 --> 06:26.429
Fine, George.

06:26.512 --> 06:28.389
No, I don't like it. Georgie.

06:29.682 --> 06:31.059
I see you haven't changed one bit.

06:31.142 --> 06:33.061
Thank you. That is a nice thing to say.

06:34.687 --> 06:37.565
Hey, I'm Leonard.
I'm here for no reason.

06:39.442 --> 06:40.735
What do you want, Sheldon?

06:40.943 --> 06:42.987
Why aren't you returning my phone calls?

06:43.112 --> 06:46.032
You're supposed to be the smart one,
you figure it out.

06:46.866 --> 06:49.410
He's not that kinda smart.
You might wanna give him a hint.

06:51.329 --> 06:53.539
We haven't talked in over 10 years.

06:53.790 --> 06:54.791
Now that you need something,

06:54.874 --> 06:56.501
you think you can just
show up at my store?

06:56.584 --> 06:59.504
Well, let's just drop everything
to accommodate Sheldon.

06:59.837 --> 07:03.508
Nice try, but I'm not
a gullible little boy anymore.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.343
I can recognize sarcasm.

07:06.844 --> 07:10.264
Okay. You're right.
I'm sorry. Tell me what you need.

07:10.348 --> 07:12.183
Your wish is my command.

07:12.266 --> 07:13.434
That's better. Thank you.

07:21.526 --> 07:22.527
Oh, my God!

07:26.364 --> 07:27.782
<i>Yeah, I got it too.</i>

07:28.825 --> 07:31.035
You really can't keep
your hands off Howard, can you?

07:31.452 --> 07:32.787
<i>I know, I have a problem.</i>

07:34.330 --> 07:36.666
<i>I just wanted to make sure
you and Amy didn't get it.</i>

07:36.833 --> 07:38.501
Well, I didn't get it.

07:40.795 --> 07:43.297
You infected me
a week before my wedding!

07:45.341 --> 07:47.093
What am I supposed to do about this?

07:48.177 --> 07:49.387
<i>Wear a veil?</i>

07:52.682 --> 07:53.683
That's not funny.

07:55.601 --> 07:57.270
Look at what you've done to me!

07:57.353 --> 08:00.606
Hey, could you just, like,
not touch my computer,

08:00.690 --> 08:04.026
or maybe, like, anything else. I just...

08:04.110 --> 08:06.946
Oh! I don't wanna look like that
in your wedding photos.

08:09.365 --> 08:10.908
There aren't gonna be
any wedding photos.

08:10.992 --> 08:12.451
My fianc√©'s a germophobe.

08:12.535 --> 08:15.621
If he finds out I'm contagious,
he'll never come back from Texas.

08:16.122 --> 08:19.083
<i>What if we tell him
the theme of the wedding is</i> Walking Dead

08:19.167 --> 08:20.585
<i>and this is our zombie makeup?</i>

08:22.336 --> 08:24.213
That'll probably work.
We'll call that plan B.

08:27.258 --> 08:28.259
Well, hmmm...

08:29.719 --> 08:32.013
Turns out this is gonna
come in handy after all.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.351
Hold up. I'm... I'm confused.

08:37.435 --> 08:38.936
You didn't want me at your wedding.

08:39.312 --> 08:41.856
But now that Mom won't come,
you want me there?

08:42.773 --> 08:47.069
I know you don't hear this a lot,
but that is exactly right. Good job.

08:49.197 --> 08:50.573
Not helping, Sheldon.

08:51.157 --> 08:52.325
Listen here.

08:52.491 --> 08:56.078
You want me at your wedding,
all you got to do is ask nicely.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.458
- Georgie...
- George.

09:03.794 --> 09:07.256
I would like you at my wedding.

09:07.715 --> 09:08.966
Thank you, Sheldon.

09:09.342 --> 09:10.676
That is so nice to hear.

09:11.969 --> 09:14.639
But I would rather swallow
a pregnant wildcat

09:14.722 --> 09:16.891
and crap out a litter of kittens!

09:19.977 --> 09:23.814
It is fitting that you got into tires,
because you are tiresome.

09:25.983 --> 09:26.984
Sheldon, come on.

09:28.653 --> 09:30.947
- Was that too mean?
- No, not too mean.

09:31.030 --> 09:32.198
Not too good either.

09:38.246 --> 09:40.289
No, Mother, that's not fair.

09:40.873 --> 09:41.916
But he told...

09:42.625 --> 09:43.668
Yes, ma'am.

09:44.627 --> 09:45.670
But I said...

09:46.170 --> 09:47.338
Yes, ma'am.

09:48.631 --> 09:49.632
Goodbye.

09:50.758 --> 09:51.759
What'd she say?

09:52.176 --> 09:53.761
She's not getting in the middle of it,

09:53.844 --> 09:56.639
because we "boys need to
work it out ourselves."

09:57.431 --> 09:59.850
Well, maybe it's fine
if she doesn't come to the wedding.

10:00.268 --> 10:01.602
I've got Amy now,

10:01.686 --> 10:04.105
and she can do everything
a mom can do and more.

10:06.399 --> 10:08.693
Say that to her on the wedding night,
really spice things up.

10:10.403 --> 10:11.946
This is all Georgie's fault.

10:12.405 --> 10:14.448
My whole childhood he was mean to me.

10:14.532 --> 10:17.326
Sorry. I know what it's like
to live with a bully.

10:18.369 --> 10:19.662
Your brother bullied you?

10:19.870 --> 10:21.706
I was talking about Penny, but sure.

10:23.165 --> 10:24.500
Once, when I was eight,

10:24.583 --> 10:27.086
I was going to dress
as my favorite scientist for Halloween,

10:27.169 --> 10:29.088
and Georgie threw my costume away.

10:29.338 --> 10:31.382
I had to wear a sheet and go as a ghost.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.218
Scared myself all night long.

10:36.762 --> 10:38.723
Look, we don't fly out
until the morning.

10:38.806 --> 10:41.392
Why don't I try and talk to him?
Give it one more shot?

10:43.227 --> 10:44.228
All right.

10:45.813 --> 10:48.149
But if he says, "Nerd says what,"
don't answer him.

10:48.232 --> 10:50.192
- What?
- You are a lamb to the slaughter.

10:54.613 --> 10:55.698
So, how was your date?

10:59.243 --> 11:02.204
It was going well
until my eye dripped in her latte.

11:04.999 --> 11:06.792
We're so sorry we ruined your date.

11:06.959 --> 11:08.836
Oh! Boo-hoo!

11:10.004 --> 11:11.422
I mean, his date got ruined.

11:11.505 --> 11:14.133
I'm about to get married and look at me.

11:15.885 --> 11:17.011
Looks like it's getting better.

11:17.094 --> 11:21.182
Oh! Does it? Does it look like that
with your two clear eyes?

11:23.142 --> 11:25.603
I'm sorry, are you mad
that I don't have pink eye?

11:25.686 --> 11:26.979
- What do you think?
- Yes!

11:30.941 --> 11:35.237
Uh-huh. Okay. Okay.
Listen, I hear you.

11:35.404 --> 11:36.906
I know they're pricey,

11:36.989 --> 11:40.826
but these are the Dallas Cowboys
of tires, okay?

11:40.951 --> 11:42.661
And we're talking
the Troy Aikman Cowboys,

11:42.745 --> 11:44.497
not that pretty boy, Tony Romo.

11:46.165 --> 11:49.043
All right, good call.
You won't regret it.

11:50.002 --> 11:51.045
Boom!

11:51.128 --> 11:52.630
Wow! That was impressive.

11:52.713 --> 11:55.091
Yeah, well, it's easy
when you love your product,

11:55.466 --> 11:56.884
and hate Tony Romo.

11:58.511 --> 12:00.304
Yeah, that guy's...

12:00.888 --> 12:02.890
I'm sorry, I don't know who that guy is.

12:04.100 --> 12:07.103
If you're here about Sheldon's wedding,
don't bother.

12:07.478 --> 12:10.022
Come on, I know
you two have your differences.

12:10.106 --> 12:11.774
You mean pretty much
everything about us?

12:12.066 --> 12:13.609
Well, not everything.

12:13.692 --> 12:14.985
You're both tall,

12:15.528 --> 12:16.862
you have the same last name...

12:18.114 --> 12:20.241
Maybe I shouldn't have started this
like it was a list.

12:21.659 --> 12:24.036
You have no idea
what you are talking about.

12:24.120 --> 12:26.497
Ooh! There, that was very Sheldon.

12:28.749 --> 12:32.169
Look, I'm... I'm sure
he was not the easiest brother to have,

12:32.253 --> 12:35.673
but it wasn't easy for him either
with you picking on him all the time.

12:37.758 --> 12:40.302
Picking on him?
Is that what he told you?

12:41.095 --> 12:43.931
Well, what about the time
you threw away his Halloween costume?

12:44.515 --> 12:47.810
Well, yeah, 'cause he was gonna dress
as some girl scientist.

12:50.729 --> 12:51.730
Madame Curie?

12:53.023 --> 12:54.900
I didn't know she was a madam.

12:57.611 --> 13:00.156
Come on, he was still gonna get beat up
for wearing that dress.

13:00.906 --> 13:03.451
Didn't you sit on his head
while he tried to watch <i>Star Trek?</i>

13:03.951 --> 13:05.744
Well, yeah, but that was hilarious.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.331
That is pretty hilarious.

13:10.749 --> 13:11.959
Look, I mean, uh...

13:12.042 --> 13:14.628
I always looked out for him at school,
I drove him everywhere,

13:14.712 --> 13:17.089
I apologized to people when he was rude.

13:17.173 --> 13:19.258
Yeah. I've done all that.

13:19.633 --> 13:22.761
I've also removed all the red balloons
from his Lucky Charms,

13:22.845 --> 13:24.472
because they weren't "Irish enough."

13:24.972 --> 13:26.765
All right,
so you know what I'm talking about.

13:26.849 --> 13:28.559
And has he ever thanked you?

13:29.518 --> 13:31.270
Not in so many words...

13:31.645 --> 13:32.938
Or any words.

13:33.731 --> 13:35.858
Would it kill him to actually say it?

13:37.443 --> 13:38.444
No.

13:39.236 --> 13:40.613
No, it wouldn't kill him.

13:43.282 --> 13:44.283
Leonard...

13:45.659 --> 13:49.330
You know how I got the money
to open up my first store?

13:50.539 --> 13:51.999
I busted my ass for it,

13:52.541 --> 13:54.960
'cause all the extra money that we had
had to go to Sheldon,

13:55.044 --> 13:58.255
so he could go to college,
and he could go study in Germany.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.258
And do you know
what he's never said to me?

14:02.092 --> 14:03.385
<i>Danke sch√∂n?</i>

14:06.430 --> 14:07.973
It's "thank you" in German.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.142
Do you need me to sit on your head?

14:12.102 --> 14:13.145
Nope.

14:13.521 --> 14:14.939
After all my sacrifices,

14:16.190 --> 14:18.442
guess which kid
my mom is the most proud of.

14:21.111 --> 14:22.404
If it makes you feel any better,

14:22.738 --> 14:24.657
my mom's most proud
of Sheldon too, so...

14:26.909 --> 14:27.910
Leonard,

14:28.619 --> 14:29.787
you want a beer?

14:30.204 --> 14:31.580
Yeah, I would love a beer.

14:32.456 --> 14:34.333
- There you go.
- Thanks. Can you open it for me?

14:34.416 --> 14:35.918
- No. It's a twist-off.
- I know.

14:47.429 --> 14:50.891
Hey, I got all the beads
to the other side.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.270
It's not a puzzle, Penny.

14:56.313 --> 14:58.107
Do you really wanna be touching that?

14:58.190 --> 14:59.775
Do you know how many sick kids...

14:59.858 --> 15:01.860
You know what?
Never mind, knock yourself out.

15:04.488 --> 15:06.532
Bernadette says
they're checking the kids now.

15:06.740 --> 15:08.784
You know,
maybe we didn't all need to come.

15:09.034 --> 15:12.371
Hey, whatever kind of pink eye
their kids have, I have.

15:12.454 --> 15:15.416
And I need to know.
And if it's viral, I'm screwed.

15:15.624 --> 15:16.625
Maybe not.

15:16.709 --> 15:19.169
You know, I know
it's not traditional wedding attire,

15:19.253 --> 15:21.005
but how about a welder's mask?

15:22.715 --> 15:25.175
If you know a welder
that could be your something borrowed.

15:28.220 --> 15:29.847
Great news, it's bacterial.

15:30.431 --> 15:32.433
- Yeah!
- Yes!

15:32.516 --> 15:35.185
- What are you doing? Wash your hands!
- Not you.

15:39.523 --> 15:40.858
Hello, room service.

15:40.941 --> 15:43.736
I'm calling about the club sandwich
on your menu.

15:44.987 --> 15:48.490
No, I don't want one.
I just want you to spell it correctly.

15:50.409 --> 15:53.203
Unless the "club"
is the Poor Typing Club.

15:54.413 --> 16:00.210
Okay. Now let's discuss
this "15% gratooty."

16:02.004 --> 16:03.839
Well, that was rude.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.675
Someone just lost their gratooty.

16:09.428 --> 16:11.972
Sheldon, you need to apologize
to your brother.

16:12.598 --> 16:13.682
I'm sorry?

16:13.766 --> 16:15.893
Yes, like that but nicer and that way.

16:17.645 --> 16:20.356
- I have nothing to apologize for.
- Huh.

16:20.481 --> 16:21.982
I told you this was a bad idea.

16:22.066 --> 16:24.943
Sometimes you can't patch a tire,
you just got to buy a new one.

16:25.152 --> 16:28.113
Actually, that's always the case.
Never patch, buy new.

16:29.406 --> 16:32.576
While I appreciate
your folksy tire wisdom,

16:32.660 --> 16:35.204
I don't appreciate
what you're putting Mom through.

16:35.371 --> 16:37.081
What would you know about
what Mom's been through?

16:37.164 --> 16:38.248
You were never home.

16:38.332 --> 16:40.000
Yeah. This is good, get it all out.

16:40.084 --> 16:41.085
- Not now.
- Shut up!

16:41.877 --> 16:43.921
You went away to college after Dad died.

16:44.254 --> 16:45.756
Who do you think
took care of everything?

16:46.131 --> 16:48.967
Mom did.
Mom always took care of everything.

16:49.551 --> 16:50.594
Mom was a mess.

16:50.969 --> 16:54.264
Missy was a dumb teenager.
I had to look after both of them.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.100
I talked to Mom all the time.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.935
If she was upset,
she would have told me.

16:58.143 --> 17:02.147
She was protecting you, you idiot,
just like everyone always does.

17:02.815 --> 17:05.401
If things were bad,
then why didn't you tell me?

17:05.484 --> 17:07.653
Because I was protecting you too.

17:11.156 --> 17:12.825
You're my baby brother, Sheldon.

17:13.617 --> 17:15.661
I know life has been hard for you,

17:17.204 --> 17:19.123
but that don't mean
it's been easy for the rest of us.

17:22.084 --> 17:25.254
I suppose I didn't think about
how it was for everyone else.

17:26.004 --> 17:27.089
No, that's all right.

17:28.132 --> 17:29.675
I know you didn't.

17:31.844 --> 17:32.845
I'm sorry.

17:35.472 --> 17:36.473
Thank you.

17:37.141 --> 17:42.062
And it would mean a lot to me
to have my big brother at my wedding.

17:46.358 --> 17:47.609
I wouldn't miss it.

17:53.907 --> 17:56.326
Is it me or did we just patch a tire?

18:00.831 --> 18:03.375
He said "never patch."
Do you even listen?

18:13.761 --> 18:15.304
<i>Hey, how's it going?</i>

18:17.806 --> 18:18.974
Really good.

18:19.433 --> 18:21.435
Georgie's going to come to the wedding.

18:21.643 --> 18:22.978
<i>Oh! That's great!</i>

18:23.520 --> 18:25.314
Why aren't you looking at the camera?

18:25.397 --> 18:27.608
<i>You know, I'm just working
on my peripheral vision.</i>

18:30.068 --> 18:31.737
That is nonsense.

18:31.820 --> 18:34.031
Your peripheral vision is fine.

18:34.364 --> 18:37.826
Are those women's magazines making you
feel bad about yourself again?

18:39.870 --> 18:41.747
Yep, that is what's happening.

18:43.332 --> 18:44.625
I have told you before.

18:44.708 --> 18:46.710
Those women are airbrushed,

18:46.794 --> 18:48.754
to make it look like
they have good vision.

18:50.798 --> 18:54.218
Hey, I was thinking,
now that you and your brother made up,

18:54.593 --> 18:56.094
there's no reason to rush home.

18:56.470 --> 18:57.805
<i>Maybe you and Leonard could...</i>

18:58.514 --> 19:00.057
Could stay for...

19:01.517 --> 19:03.727
Two to three more
fun-filled days there.

19:06.063 --> 19:07.648
That's a great idea.

19:07.731 --> 19:09.441
Hey, Leonard, good news.

19:09.525 --> 19:12.778
We do have time to visit
the Museum of the American Railroad.

19:15.030 --> 19:16.615
I'd say no, but what's the point?

19:23.455 --> 19:24.915
You might not wanna get too close.

19:25.624 --> 19:26.667
Pink eye.

19:28.418 --> 19:29.503
Me, too!

19:31.421 --> 19:32.798
- Bacterial?
- Yeah.

19:33.131 --> 19:34.174
Same!

19:35.926 --> 19:37.886
I know this is gonna sound crazy,

19:38.303 --> 19:40.556
but would you be interested
in going to a wedding with me?
