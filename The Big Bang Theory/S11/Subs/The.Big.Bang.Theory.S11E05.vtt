WEBVTT

00:03.922 --> 00:05.382
Thanks for letting me put
Halley in your room.

00:05.548 --> 00:06.549
Oh, no problem.

00:06.716 --> 00:09.010
And Penny, she kinda threw up
on your stuffed bear.

00:09.594 --> 00:10.762
Oh, that's okay.

00:10.845 --> 00:12.681
Hey,
that's an Ewok and it's mine.

00:13.014 --> 00:14.140
Yeah, which is why it's okay.

00:16.476 --> 00:18.687
See, he gets Ewoks in his bed.

00:19.688 --> 00:21.106
You've got Chewbacca, that's enough.

00:22.941 --> 00:25.485
I used to have the stuffed raccoon
from <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i>

00:25.610 --> 00:27.487
but Cinnamon licked it raw.

00:30.865 --> 00:33.702
There's a time and place
for your randy dog stories

00:35.161 --> 00:36.329
and it's never and nowhere.

00:37.872 --> 00:41.459
Yeah, no more stories about sex,
so Amy, that brings us to you.

00:43.002 --> 00:44.087
Well, at work we've been doing

00:44.170 --> 00:45.922
some interesting research
with neuroprosthetics.

00:46.256 --> 00:48.299
Neat. I've been re-watching <i>Th e O. C.,</i>

00:48.383 --> 00:50.427
so we're all leading productive lives.

00:52.220 --> 00:53.972
We've been working
on a computer interface

00:54.055 --> 00:56.808
that can use brain wave patterns
to control robotic limbs,

00:57.058 --> 00:59.769
but we're having a little trouble
localizing the signal from the EEG cap.

01:00.311 --> 01:02.731
Oh, well, have you thought about adding
a phased array of sensors

01:02.856 --> 01:03.940
for better localization?

01:04.899 --> 01:06.443
Actually, that never occurred to me.

01:06.901 --> 01:09.612
It never occurred to me
I would miss the Ewok conversation.

01:12.699 --> 01:14.659
Good, 'cause I just bought
another one on Amazon.

01:16.661 --> 01:19.080
You know, I could use
an engineer on this project.

01:19.539 --> 01:21.791
Well, now, this works out great.
Howard's an engineer.

01:22.333 --> 01:24.002
I'm sure he knows someone qualified.

01:25.754 --> 01:27.005
She's talking about me, Sheldon.

01:27.088 --> 01:28.214
I'm perfectly qualified.

01:28.631 --> 01:30.675
Yeah, Howie's the world's best engineer.

01:30.759 --> 01:32.427
It says so right on his coffee mug.

01:34.137 --> 01:36.055
- Aw, you got him a mug?
- I did.

01:38.308 --> 01:39.559
But it's not a competition.

01:40.727 --> 01:42.604
Yeah, I lost that battle years ago.

01:44.731 --> 01:45.982
So, Howard, are you interested?

01:46.399 --> 01:49.444
Are you kidding? If I could control
robot arms with my brain

01:49.527 --> 01:51.362
I'd be able to do so many things.

01:51.696 --> 01:54.783
Really? Because you've been controlling
human arms with your brain for years

01:54.866 --> 01:56.034
and not much has come of it.

02:24.479 --> 02:25.730
Hey, what you reading?

02:25.897 --> 02:27.023
A parenting book.

02:27.565 --> 02:28.858
Oh, my God. Are we...

02:29.067 --> 02:30.276
What? No.

02:31.778 --> 02:33.780
You think this is how I would tell you?

02:35.365 --> 02:37.534
Well, you're sitting there
with a book.

02:37.617 --> 02:38.827
It felt like anything was possible.

02:38.910 --> 02:39.994
I don't know.

02:43.873 --> 02:45.333
Bernadette left it here.

02:45.416 --> 02:46.835
Oh, yeah? Anything interesting?

02:47.085 --> 02:49.337
Well, I just saw a picture
of a baby's head crowning,

02:49.420 --> 02:51.631
so I hope you enjoyed sex,
because we're done with that.

02:54.133 --> 02:55.134
Hello.

02:55.218 --> 02:56.219
- Hey, Sheldon, what's up?
- Hi.

02:56.678 --> 03:00.139
Remember how disappointed you were
when Amy started driving me to work?

03:01.140 --> 03:02.141
Sure the...

03:03.476 --> 03:06.646
Sometimes people smile
a big smile of disappointment.

03:07.522 --> 03:08.648
Yeah, well, good news,

03:08.731 --> 03:11.067
Amy had to go in early
to show Howard around her lab,

03:11.150 --> 03:12.610
so you get to drive me.

03:13.862 --> 03:17.323
Aw, his smile of disappointment
has turned into a frown of joy.

03:19.325 --> 03:20.660
It's fine.
I've been driving him for years,

03:20.743 --> 03:21.828
what's one more day?

03:22.203 --> 03:23.788
Oh, and I got
a new car game we can play.

03:23.872 --> 03:25.039
It's called, "What siren am I?"

03:25.206 --> 03:26.207
Kill me.

03:29.752 --> 03:31.296
Amy, your lab is amazing.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.548
A C-arm fluoroscope.

03:33.882 --> 03:36.217
A cranial ultrasound.

03:37.594 --> 03:39.012
And look at that coffee maker.

03:41.139 --> 03:44.100
I know. On our expense report,
I listed it as

03:44.392 --> 03:46.644
"Eduardo," my Colombian lab assistant.

03:48.605 --> 03:51.065
- So, this is it?
- Yes.

03:51.399 --> 03:53.151
We're using it to map brainwave patterns

03:53.276 --> 03:55.028
and then converting them
into electrical impulses

03:55.236 --> 03:57.697
that can be used to control anything
from wheelchairs to robots.

03:58.239 --> 03:59.324
Based on that ring on your finger,

03:59.407 --> 04:01.492
I'd say you're pretty good
at controlling robots.

04:02.493 --> 04:04.370
Careful, that's my fiancÃ©
you're talking about

04:05.038 --> 04:06.539
and I can program him to hurt you.

04:19.052 --> 04:21.471
I don't know, French police?

04:22.180 --> 04:25.725
Oh, so close. Belgian ambulance.

04:27.977 --> 04:28.978
All right. You ready for your next one?

04:29.062 --> 04:31.022
And just a warning,
this one's a little annoying.

04:32.440 --> 04:35.526
All right, all right. Let's take
a little break. I'm getting a headache.

04:35.818 --> 04:36.861
Oh.

04:36.945 --> 04:38.613
Right in the middle of our fun game.

04:40.615 --> 04:41.824
Yeah, weird.

04:43.159 --> 04:46.704
So, Howard and Amy working together,
that's interesting, huh?

04:47.163 --> 04:48.915
Eh, it's all right, I suppose.

04:49.165 --> 04:50.792
When usually when Amy complains

04:50.875 --> 04:52.627
about her co-workers
I just tune her out,

04:52.710 --> 04:55.213
but now I'll be able to join in
and pound away.

04:57.215 --> 04:58.758
You're not jealous of Howard, are you?

04:59.258 --> 05:00.843
You... Of course not.

05:00.969 --> 05:02.512
The only engineer I'm jealous of

05:02.595 --> 05:04.263
is the one who blows the train whistle.

05:05.014 --> 05:06.766
Ooh, that just gave me an idea
for a new game,

05:06.933 --> 05:08.267
"What whistle am I?"

05:08.393 --> 05:09.394
Train.

05:12.105 --> 05:14.065
For your information,
it was going to be tea kettle,

05:14.899 --> 05:17.110
but the tea kettle was on a train,
so I'll give it to you.

05:21.114 --> 05:23.199
If we add phase detection
to your EEG sensors,

05:23.282 --> 05:24.951
I'll have to rewrite most of the code.

05:25.284 --> 05:26.285
Can you do that?

05:26.369 --> 05:28.037
These hands were made
to do three things.

05:28.162 --> 05:30.790
Close-up magic, writing code
and the dirty shadow puppet show

05:30.873 --> 05:32.250
that got me kicked out of Hebrew school.

05:35.003 --> 05:36.004
Hello.

05:36.546 --> 05:38.631
Hi. What a nice surprise.

05:38.756 --> 05:41.134
Well, I just came by to see
how you two were getting along.

05:41.217 --> 05:43.011
Well, everything's going really great.

05:43.469 --> 05:45.013
Aw, that's nice to hear.

05:46.556 --> 05:48.766
I was hoping
you two would enjoy working together.

05:50.810 --> 05:51.853
What's with the blinking?

05:53.312 --> 05:54.522
It's Morse code.

05:56.566 --> 05:57.692
So we can talk about...

06:00.445 --> 06:02.196
Without hurting... Feelings.

06:05.241 --> 06:06.743
Uh, Sheldon, I don't know Morse code.

06:07.035 --> 06:09.871
I do. And if you have something to say,
you can say it to my face.

06:10.580 --> 06:11.706
Oh.

06:11.831 --> 06:12.832
All right.

06:22.383 --> 06:24.093
I'm a little rusty,
could you say that again?

06:35.605 --> 06:37.440
She's going to be home at "8:00-ish"?

06:37.523 --> 06:40.068
What is that? 8:01, 8:02?

06:40.151 --> 06:41.569
And what kind of scientist uses "ish"?

06:43.488 --> 06:45.823
I'll give it a go.
My ride home with you was hellish.

06:48.951 --> 06:51.329
Sheldon, honey, if you wanna join us
for dinner you're more than welcome.

06:51.496 --> 06:54.207
Oh, thank you. I don't think
I'd be very good company tonight.

06:54.791 --> 06:56.084
Hmm, well, then out you go.

06:58.503 --> 06:59.629
Okay, what is going on?

07:00.004 --> 07:01.589
Well, ever since
Amy started working with Howard

07:01.714 --> 07:02.924
she hasn't been home.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.634
Didn't that just start this morning?

07:06.344 --> 07:07.553
And has she been home?

07:08.971 --> 07:10.640
You know, that would frustrate me.

07:12.183 --> 07:13.559
Does it frustrate you?

07:13.643 --> 07:14.852
It does.

07:14.977 --> 07:15.978
I get that.

07:16.395 --> 07:19.524
You know, it's okay to feel frustrated
when things aren't going your way.

07:20.274 --> 07:21.901
I suppose.

07:21.984 --> 07:23.361
Ah, maybe it's not that big a deal.

07:23.611 --> 07:25.988
No, no, no, your feelings are valid.

07:26.447 --> 07:27.615
Now, why don't you go wash up

07:28.157 --> 07:29.575
and we'll call you when dinner's ready.

07:35.248 --> 07:36.249
Okay.

07:39.377 --> 07:41.003
What did you do? Are you a witch?

07:42.171 --> 07:44.132
Well, I've been reading
Bernadette's parenting book.

07:44.215 --> 07:46.134
It's like the answer key
to the Sheldon test.

07:48.553 --> 07:49.554
That's amazing.

07:49.637 --> 07:51.889
I know. But, you know,
it's only birth to five.

07:51.973 --> 07:53.349
What do we do when he turns six?

07:55.685 --> 07:57.103
Take him to the zoo and leave him there.

08:00.690 --> 08:02.024
Hey, Bernadette.

08:02.567 --> 08:04.068
Oh, hey, Raj. Howard's not here.

08:04.277 --> 08:07.405
I know. He's been at the lab every night
this week with his work wife.

08:08.781 --> 08:11.200
That's weird, I thought his work wife
was standing in my kitchen.

08:13.077 --> 08:15.955
Don't be snippy, I came to see
how you were doing.

08:16.038 --> 08:17.707
Like, uh, do you need
help with anything?

08:18.499 --> 08:19.500
Thank you.

08:19.792 --> 08:21.335
There are a few things around the house

08:21.419 --> 08:23.588
that I've been waiting for Howard
to get to. The smoke alarms need...

08:23.713 --> 08:25.256
No, I meant emotionally.

08:27.091 --> 08:28.384
How are you feeling?

08:28.634 --> 08:30.178
Like you're not really here to help me.

08:32.513 --> 08:33.931
Wow, still snippy.

08:35.474 --> 08:36.934
Everything's fine.

08:37.143 --> 08:38.895
Howard's really excited about his work,

08:38.978 --> 08:41.230
he's been in a great mood.
I'm really proud of him.

08:41.689 --> 08:44.317
And I can fit into the pants
I wore in high school.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.152
Come on,
we don't need to lie to each other.

08:48.196 --> 08:50.114
You're right. I have a teething baby,

08:50.198 --> 08:52.200
I'm pregnant, I have a proposal
due tomorrow,

08:52.283 --> 08:54.785
I don't have time to hear about
how much you're missing my husband.

08:56.204 --> 08:58.414
Well, I think I know why
he's been working so late.

09:02.835 --> 09:04.420
- Hi.
- Welcome home.

09:04.837 --> 09:06.631
- How was work?
- Great.

09:06.797 --> 09:08.883
- Howard had an idea for...
- That's enough about work.

09:10.885 --> 09:14.180
You just got here. You need to sit down
and let me pamper you.

09:14.680 --> 09:15.681
Oh.

09:15.806 --> 09:17.141
Well, that sounds nice.

09:17.558 --> 09:19.810
I got you a little something
to help you relax.

09:20.645 --> 09:23.105
Sheldon, that is the sweetest...

09:25.983 --> 09:27.318
Wha... What is this?

09:27.526 --> 09:29.695
The notes from our
quantum cognition project.

09:30.321 --> 09:33.366
I thought we could spend the evening
grinding away on it.

09:35.117 --> 09:37.828
I just got home. I'm tired.

09:38.079 --> 09:39.288
Of Howard. I know.

09:40.748 --> 09:44.543
So how about you and me
make some beautiful science together?

09:46.921 --> 09:49.298
Sheldon, I want
to work on this with you,

09:49.382 --> 09:50.383
just not tonight.

09:51.008 --> 09:52.885
What if we get up early
and do it in the morning?

09:53.010 --> 09:54.887
I promise I'll be way more into it.

09:56.681 --> 09:57.890
You know what?

09:58.015 --> 09:59.517
There was a time
that you would have been happy

09:59.600 --> 10:01.727
to stay up and collaborate
all night with me

10:01.811 --> 10:03.771
and then wake up in the morning
and do it some more.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.608
Fine, but can we make it quick?

10:08.734 --> 10:11.279
No. If you're just going to make me
do all the work, then go to bed.

10:12.071 --> 10:14.699
But don't be surprised if you walk
out here and catch me doing it myself.

10:22.999 --> 10:24.041
Ugh.

10:24.125 --> 10:26.210
Sheldon's texting me
to drive him to Bernadette's.

10:26.502 --> 10:27.503
What are you gonna say?

10:27.878 --> 10:30.089
Well, they did just introduce
the middle finger emoji.

10:30.172 --> 10:31.799
If it's not for this,
I don't know what it's for.

10:33.217 --> 10:35.469
No, no, no. He'll just think that means,
"Be there in a minute."

10:36.595 --> 10:39.724
But... maybe there's something
in the book that will help.

10:39.849 --> 10:41.058
Worth a shot.

10:41.267 --> 10:43.394
Okay, let's see, let's see.

10:44.145 --> 10:45.438
"Biting other children?"

10:45.604 --> 10:47.898
Sometimes, but problem for another day.

10:49.567 --> 10:50.693
Okay, wait, wait, here we go.

10:50.776 --> 10:52.445
"Let him have ownership of his choices.

10:52.528 --> 10:55.239
"Allow him to choose from options
that are acceptable to you."

10:55.906 --> 10:57.325
All right. I'll give it a try.

10:58.284 --> 11:00.703
I can drive you in two hours, or

11:01.078 --> 11:02.163
you can take an Uber.

11:02.621 --> 11:04.874
Good. See, now he feels like
he has a choice.

11:07.293 --> 11:08.502
He's gonna take an Uber.

11:10.546 --> 11:11.756
It worked.

11:13.299 --> 11:15.134
Unless he bites the driver, yeah.

11:18.763 --> 11:20.431
And now they're working on a Saturday.

11:20.514 --> 11:21.766
Can you believe them?

11:21.891 --> 11:23.392
I mean, is this how
you envisioned your weekend?

11:23.809 --> 11:25.144
No, it is not.

11:26.604 --> 11:28.189
This whole thing is maddening.

11:29.482 --> 11:30.983
I'm really busy.

11:31.150 --> 11:32.443
I don't have time
to listen to you complain.

11:33.235 --> 11:35.029
Hey, you're complaining too.

11:35.279 --> 11:36.697
"Sheldon, why are you here?"

11:36.781 --> 11:38.574
"Sheldon, the applesauce
is for the baby."

11:40.743 --> 11:41.911
What do you want?

11:42.286 --> 11:45.122
I just wish I could make
Howard feel as angry as I'm feeling.

11:47.625 --> 11:51.379
Well, maybe you could do something
he likes and make him jealous.

11:52.421 --> 11:54.965
- Like what?
- Have you ever read <i>Tom Sawyer?</i>

11:55.549 --> 11:57.301
- No.
- Chores. He likes chores.

12:00.304 --> 12:02.390
Ooh, what kind of chores?

12:03.140 --> 12:06.185
Well, you could change the batteries
in the smoke detectors.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.187
That would drive him crazy.

12:09.855 --> 12:11.148
That's great.

12:11.273 --> 12:13.692
Oh, he'll be so mad
smoke will be coming out of his ears

12:13.776 --> 12:15.820
and then the smoke detectors
will detect it.

12:17.947 --> 12:20.408
Wait a minute, hold on.
Why'd you ask me about <i>Tom Sawyer?</i>

12:21.450 --> 12:23.160
I'm just interested in you.

12:23.327 --> 12:25.830
Wha... You are sweeter
than your applesauce.

12:30.584 --> 12:31.669
Okay, I'm going to extend the wait time

12:31.752 --> 12:33.045
and have it poll the A to D converter

12:33.129 --> 12:34.630
at the top of the loop
instead of the bottom.

12:35.131 --> 12:36.215
Ah, that's impressive.

12:36.382 --> 12:38.467
You think that's impressive,
take apart that brain model.

12:42.972 --> 12:45.266
Oh, my God, three of clubs,
that was my card.

12:45.433 --> 12:46.642
How did you...

12:48.769 --> 12:50.229
I used make it appear in my pants,

12:50.312 --> 12:52.440
but HR said I had to stop doing that.

12:55.192 --> 12:56.986
So, how much longer till we can test it?

12:57.445 --> 13:01.031
It needs to compile,
so it's gonna be a few minutes.

13:01.115 --> 13:02.950
Sounds like we've
earned ourselves a break.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.369
Wanna hear some Neil Sedaka?

13:06.287 --> 13:08.289
You know,
that's your greatest magic trick

13:08.372 --> 13:09.790
'cause you just read my mind.

13:29.477 --> 13:31.812
Well, well, well.

13:33.397 --> 13:34.482
- Hi.
- Hey.

13:34.607 --> 13:37.776
You say you're busy as bees,
yet here you are, dancing.

13:38.903 --> 13:40.321
Although, I suppose bees do dance,

13:40.446 --> 13:42.948
but their dance lets other bees know
where the pollen is,

13:43.032 --> 13:47.286
and yours does not. So my logic,
despite that slight detour, does track.

13:50.247 --> 13:52.124
We're just waiting
for my code to compile.

13:52.208 --> 13:53.250
What are you doing here?

13:53.417 --> 13:55.544
I stopped by to see if you wanted
to go to the movies with me.

13:56.212 --> 13:57.379
Oh, I'd love to,

13:57.630 --> 14:00.591
but we're just about to test
the interface. It could take a while.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.719
Okay, buddy, this is not my place,

14:04.178 --> 14:06.347
but Bernadette's been feeling
a little abandoned

14:06.430 --> 14:08.015
with all the hours
you've been putting in.

14:08.474 --> 14:10.142
You just asked him to go to the movies.

14:10.643 --> 14:12.937
Yeah, but our weird relationship
was grandfathered into their marriage,

14:13.020 --> 14:14.063
and yours was not.

14:18.275 --> 14:21.070
Okay, I put new batteries
in the smoke detectors.

14:21.612 --> 14:22.613
Did you do the laundry?

14:22.696 --> 14:26.033
Hmm, I sure did.
Ooh, he's gonna be steamed,

14:27.159 --> 14:28.536
just like his dress shirts.

14:30.454 --> 14:32.915
At least he can still clean the oven,
so that's something.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.875
Oh, that's what he thinks.
Where's your steel wool?

14:35.167 --> 14:36.335
Right here.

14:38.128 --> 14:39.338
We make quite the team.

14:40.381 --> 14:41.590
Sure do.

14:43.342 --> 14:44.552
Guys, you won't believe this.

14:44.677 --> 14:47.221
I stopped by the university
to check in on Howard and Amy

14:47.471 --> 14:48.556
and they were having fun.

14:48.764 --> 14:49.765
Well, don't worry.

14:49.848 --> 14:51.684
He won't be having any fun
when he gets home.

14:51.809 --> 14:53.227
I did all his favorite chores.

14:55.104 --> 14:57.648
What are you talking about?
Howard hates doing chores.

14:58.107 --> 14:59.733
Yeah, then why would
Bernadette tell me that...

14:59.858 --> 15:01.485
Bernadette.

15:04.446 --> 15:07.408
Did you play on my well-established
gullibility to clean your house?

15:08.409 --> 15:09.618
Sure did.

15:10.995 --> 15:13.122
Well, I would storm out of here,

15:13.205 --> 15:15.249
but I already have
the gloves and the steel wool

15:15.332 --> 15:16.834
and I really do love
cleaning an oven. Move.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.547
She made me do all her chores

15:21.880 --> 15:23.173
and it wasn't even her idea.

15:23.382 --> 15:24.925
She stole it from <i>Tom Sawyer.</i>

15:26.385 --> 15:27.595
You know what? This is crazy.

15:27.720 --> 15:30.139
Howard and Amy are working together,
get over it.

15:30.222 --> 15:31.265
Leonard, what are you doing?

15:31.432 --> 15:33.642
"Knowing when to say when."
This is not a big deal.

15:33.976 --> 15:35.185
It is a big deal.

15:35.269 --> 15:38.314
Howard's getting Amy used to
laughing and listening to music.

15:38.397 --> 15:39.857
What if she expects
that madness at home?

15:41.066 --> 15:42.401
You know, that is a good point.

15:42.484 --> 15:44.820
I'm really proud of the way you're
able to talk express your feelings.

15:44.903 --> 15:46.614
Thank you. I'm just so angry.

15:47.072 --> 15:49.241
You know, everyone gets angry.

15:49.533 --> 15:51.076
Even mommies and daddies.

15:54.288 --> 15:57.082
You can't think this is the right time
to validate his behavior.

15:57.291 --> 15:59.293
Okay, what about
"presenting a united front"?

15:59.460 --> 16:01.795
What about you coddling him,
and he's never gonna learn?

16:01.920 --> 16:03.130
Look.

16:03.213 --> 16:05.466
You sound frustrated,

16:05.633 --> 16:08.260
and I'm really proud of the way
you're able to state your opinion.

16:10.888 --> 16:12.598
Thank you. Wait, no, no!

16:14.308 --> 16:15.851
Don't use that book on me!

16:16.477 --> 16:17.686
Wait, what book?

16:17.853 --> 16:21.065
Penny's been using one of
Bernadette's parenting books on you.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.733
What? So has he.

16:23.275 --> 16:25.527
What makes you think
you can treat me like a child?

16:29.907 --> 16:32.117
Your shampoo comes in a Big Bird bottle.

16:33.035 --> 16:35.788
That's because the adult shampoo
burns my man eyes.

16:40.668 --> 16:41.669
Hey, what are you working on?

16:41.835 --> 16:43.170
Oh, my God. You're still here?

16:46.382 --> 16:49.468
Of course I'm here.
I know what you're going through.

16:49.635 --> 16:52.304
Really? You have a needy
Indian man in your house?

16:54.723 --> 16:56.392
I did, but then he came over here.

16:58.936 --> 17:00.688
So is this how it's gonna be
if we have kids,

17:00.771 --> 17:02.022
you're just gonna
throw me under the bus?

17:02.272 --> 17:04.274
Well, if you spoil them
the way you do Sheldon, then yeah.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.110
Uh, my way was working, okay.

17:06.193 --> 17:07.945
I think you're just upset because
there are some things

17:08.028 --> 17:09.071
I'm better than you at.

17:09.363 --> 17:11.198
Well, you can't end a sentence
with a preposition,

17:11.281 --> 17:12.282
so clearly not grammar.

17:14.201 --> 17:15.911
If you're so smart,
was that a smart thing to say?

17:16.203 --> 17:18.580
That depends. Before I said it,
was sex tonight still on the table?

17:18.831 --> 17:20.040
- No.
- Then it's fine.

17:23.460 --> 17:25.337
You know, once we get this operational,

17:25.421 --> 17:27.381
we could probably figure out
how to make it wireless.

17:28.006 --> 17:29.216
That'd be amazing.

17:30.926 --> 17:32.761
Oh, it's Sheldon.

17:33.679 --> 17:35.222
Oh, he's upset with Leonard and Penny.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.350
And Bernadette.

17:39.893 --> 17:40.978
And Mark Twain.

17:44.440 --> 17:47.651
Yeah, Bernadette texted earlier.
Raj is really getting on her nerves.

17:48.277 --> 17:49.987
I guess we have been working late a lot.

17:51.572 --> 17:52.990
Should we call it a night and go home?

17:53.407 --> 17:56.160
Or we could brew a pot of coffee
and power through.

17:57.035 --> 17:58.495
I don't know, it's getting kinda late.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.373
Hey, where's my watch?

18:01.665 --> 18:03.542
Why don't you ask your skeleton?

18:09.631 --> 18:11.842
Oh, my God, how is that even possible?

18:18.682 --> 18:20.809
This is great,
the two of us hanging out.

18:20.893 --> 18:22.144
Why didn't we think of this earlier?

18:22.311 --> 18:25.063
Agreed. I don't need Amy
to watch a movie,

18:25.439 --> 18:27.149
I can not hold your hand just as easily.

18:33.197 --> 18:35.282
In the book this is based on,

18:35.657 --> 18:37.117
that man's the killer.

19:05.604 --> 19:06.605
English - SDH
