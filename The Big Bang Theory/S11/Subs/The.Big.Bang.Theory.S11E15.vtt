WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:03.880
<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

00:04.005 --> 00:05.924
So, Leonard, tell everyone your news.

00:06.007 --> 00:08.385
I'm starting a book.

00:09.094 --> 00:12.138
That would be big news from Penny,
but you've read a book before.

00:14.224 --> 00:16.393
He means he's writing a book.

00:16.476 --> 00:19.270
I do. It's something I've been
thinking about for a long time.

00:19.396 --> 00:23.483
Yeah. It's about a brilliant physicist
who solves crimes using science.

00:23.608 --> 00:25.944
- Oh, Leonard....
- It's not about you.

00:27.987 --> 00:29.572
- Oh, boy.
- What?

00:29.656 --> 00:31.741
They cast the new Professor Proton.

00:31.825 --> 00:33.702
- Is it Sheldon?
- Not exactly.

00:33.785 --> 00:35.495
Wheaton!

00:35.578 --> 00:36.579
It's Wil Wheaton.

00:42.502 --> 00:43.670
Hey, what are you doing?

00:43.753 --> 00:45.797
I thought we were having
dinner at Leonard and Penny's.

00:45.922 --> 00:49.092
Oh, no. No, they're watching
the new <i>Professor Proton.</i>

00:49.175 --> 00:50.927
I can't keep Wil Wheaton
off the Internet,

00:51.010 --> 00:52.387
but I can keep him off my retinas.

00:53.722 --> 00:56.307
So you're just gonna sit here
by yourself and do nothing?

00:56.391 --> 00:57.851
I... Of course not.

00:57.934 --> 01:01.146
I'm going to write mean comments
about Wil's show online.

01:02.397 --> 01:04.816
Well, you can't criticize
something you haven't seen.

01:05.024 --> 01:07.402
Uh... I'm sorry. Are you familiar
with the Internet?

01:08.653 --> 01:10.280
Well, what if I watch it with you?

01:10.363 --> 01:12.741
Maybe I won't like it, and we
can complain about it together.

01:12.824 --> 01:14.659
Get your own thing to complain about.

01:15.535 --> 01:17.203
Oh, trust me, I've got one.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.749
Look, a-at least if you watch it,

01:20.832 --> 01:23.835
maybe you can find more
specific things to criticize.

01:24.002 --> 01:25.670
Oh, that is a good point.

01:25.754 --> 01:28.298
Criticisms are more hurtful
when they're specific.

01:38.349 --> 01:40.018
<i>Hey, everybody. I'm Professor Proton.</i>

01:40.101 --> 01:41.311
<i>Welcome to the show.</i>

01:41.394 --> 01:42.687
<i>Today, I will be teaching you</i>

01:42.771 --> 01:46.483
<i>how to make a real hovercraft
using common household items.</i>

01:46.775 --> 01:49.277
Oh, darn it,
I do like objects that hover.

01:50.195 --> 01:52.572
All you will need is a CD,

01:52.655 --> 01:55.700
a bottle cap, a balloon,
and some Super Glue.

01:55.825 --> 01:58.119
Oh, no! I have all those things!

02:28.107 --> 02:29.484
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:29.818 --> 02:31.110
What's that noise?

02:31.194 --> 02:33.404
Oh, uh, it's my new keyboard. Mm...

02:33.613 --> 02:35.865
It looks and sounds like
an old-fashioned typewriter.

02:35.949 --> 02:37.700
- It makes me feel like a real novelist.
- Oh.

02:38.993 --> 02:40.495
You poured yourself a Scotch.

02:40.578 --> 02:42.664
- Uh, apple juice.
- Oh.

02:43.498 --> 02:45.375
But unsweetened,
like Hemingway used to drink.

02:45.500 --> 02:46.501
Oh.

02:46.584 --> 02:48.628
- So how's the book coming along?
- Uh, good.

02:48.711 --> 02:50.505
I just wrote the part where the hero,

02:50.588 --> 02:53.216
hotshot physicist Logan Dean,
arrives at CERN.

02:53.299 --> 02:54.843
Ooh, is he based on you?

02:54.926 --> 02:57.470
Uh, kind of.
But he can eat dairy products

02:57.554 --> 02:59.013
without having to leave the room.

02:59.931 --> 03:02.141
Yeah, that's smart because
CERN is in Switzerland,

03:02.225 --> 03:03.643
and there's a lot of cheese there.

03:03.726 --> 03:06.521
Mm. Uh, believe me,
that is a plot point later.

03:07.272 --> 03:09.023
Well, I'm excited to read it
whenever you're ready.

03:09.107 --> 03:10.483
Oh, thank you.

03:11.234 --> 03:14.070
Oh, oh, I just thought
of the murder weapon!

03:14.237 --> 03:15.321
Swiss army knife?

03:16.531 --> 03:17.699
No.

03:20.535 --> 03:22.245
That's way better.

03:23.872 --> 03:26.374
Look, it works! We did it!

03:26.749 --> 03:29.419
See? There was a reason
to keep that TurboTax CD.

03:29.502 --> 03:30.712
Yeah.

03:31.379 --> 03:34.132
A CD-ROM? More like "CD-vroom."

03:35.967 --> 03:37.802
Do you feel bad you told Wil Wheaton

03:37.886 --> 03:40.138
that you'd be his enemy
if he did this show?

03:40.513 --> 03:42.432
No. I feel bad

03:42.515 --> 03:44.434
I'm engaged to somebody
that would point that out.

03:45.894 --> 03:48.897
It's time for Professor Proton's
science joke of the day.

03:49.063 --> 03:51.566
Why can you not trust atoms?

03:52.233 --> 03:53.359
Hmm.

03:53.735 --> 03:55.904
Because they make up everything.

03:56.112 --> 03:59.157
That's funny!

03:59.908 --> 04:01.910
Yeah, because they do.
They make up everything.

04:05.330 --> 04:06.748
Oh, I wonder who that could be.

04:06.915 --> 04:08.875
Just when I thought this
couldn't get any better,

04:08.958 --> 04:11.628
Wil has introduced
suspense into the show.

04:13.546 --> 04:16.382
Hey, it's real NASA astronaut,
Howard Wolowitz!

04:16.466 --> 04:18.176
What?

04:19.302 --> 04:20.511
Hey, Professor Proton.

04:20.595 --> 04:21.930
Hey, thanks for being here.

04:22.013 --> 04:24.265
No problem. I'm on my "launch" break.

04:27.310 --> 04:30.730
How could Wil ask Howard to
be on his show and not me?

04:30.897 --> 04:32.607
Well, he is an astronaut.

04:32.690 --> 04:35.568
And he didn't start an online
petition to get Wil fired.

04:36.653 --> 04:38.655
Why, why wouldn't Howard tell me?

04:38.738 --> 04:40.239
Well, because he probably worried

04:40.323 --> 04:42.533
that you'd be a big baby about it.

04:44.577 --> 04:45.912
All those answers make a lot of sense.

04:45.995 --> 04:47.830
Thank you, Amy. That helps.

04:49.791 --> 04:51.834
And then, when the lights come back on

04:51.918 --> 04:54.462
in the supercollider room,
Dr. Logan Dean makes

04:54.545 --> 04:57.966
two important discoveries, a gluino

04:58.383 --> 04:59.759
and murder.

05:00.718 --> 05:03.054
Oh, gluino. That's exciting.

05:03.930 --> 05:05.515
And murder.

05:06.474 --> 05:08.059
I heard you.

05:09.102 --> 05:10.979
The first time.

05:12.188 --> 05:14.524
I don't know which Hemsworth
is playing Logan Dean,

05:14.607 --> 05:15.984
but I know it's a Hemsworth.

05:16.067 --> 05:17.860
Well, Logan's actually based on me.

05:18.152 --> 05:19.612
So a young Paul Giamatti.

05:21.322 --> 05:22.949
Well, I have to finish writing it

05:23.032 --> 05:24.242
before they can make it into a movie,

05:24.325 --> 05:26.494
and I-I still have a few things
to figure out.

05:26.577 --> 05:27.870
You should talk to Bernadette.

05:27.954 --> 05:29.872
Since she's been on bed rest,
she's binged,

05:29.956 --> 05:32.291
like, every detective show in the world.

05:32.458 --> 05:35.962
Well, there was a funny detective
show in India called <i>Karamchand.</i>

05:36.087 --> 05:37.630
He had an assistant named Kitty,

05:37.714 --> 05:39.465
and he was always saying,
"Shut up, Kitty!"

05:41.968 --> 05:44.053
Sounds less mean if you say it in Hindi

05:44.137 --> 05:46.305
and don't think of women
as having feelings.

05:47.932 --> 05:48.933
Hello.

05:49.017 --> 05:50.309
- Hey.
- Hi.

05:50.476 --> 05:53.271
Howard, I want you to know
that I forgive you.

05:53.438 --> 05:54.647
I'll take it.

05:55.940 --> 05:57.483
What's he forgiving you for?

05:57.567 --> 05:59.736
Don't care. Clean slate.
Happy Yom Kippur to me.

06:01.070 --> 06:02.947
I know that you were on Wil's show,

06:03.031 --> 06:04.824
and I know why you didn't tell me.

06:04.991 --> 06:06.034
Do you?

06:06.367 --> 06:07.535
Because you were afraid

06:07.660 --> 06:09.662
that I would be difficult
and annoying about it.

06:09.787 --> 06:12.457
I hope your book has a twist
as surprising as that.

06:14.333 --> 06:15.460
It doesn't.

06:16.669 --> 06:18.421
I thought you were
boycotting Wil's show.

06:18.504 --> 06:21.049
Uh... I was,
but I decided to give it a shot,

06:21.132 --> 06:22.717
and I actually enjoyed it.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.970
Uh, just out of curiosity,
how did you come to be on the show?

06:26.054 --> 06:28.181
Did he ask you? Or did you ask him?

06:28.306 --> 06:30.475
Did you just show up on the set
and ring that doorbell?

06:31.517 --> 06:33.352
Sheldon, if you want to be on the show,

06:33.436 --> 06:35.396
you're gonna have to apologize to Wil.

06:36.439 --> 06:38.399
That would be the mature thing to do.

06:39.317 --> 06:41.152
Let's put a pin in that
and keep thinking.

06:46.699 --> 06:49.118
- Ooh.
- What? What? Which part?

06:49.660 --> 06:50.828
That was just the baby kicking.

06:51.829 --> 06:53.122
Got it.

06:53.206 --> 06:55.833
- But this is good so far, really good.
- Yeah?

06:55.917 --> 06:58.086
Yeah. I have no idea who the killer is.

06:58.169 --> 07:00.004
Oh, great. Me, neither.

07:02.215 --> 07:04.467
So does Penny know
you based a character on her?

07:05.218 --> 07:06.636
What character?

07:06.803 --> 07:08.930
Ilsa, the head of the institute.
That's clearly Penny.

07:09.013 --> 07:10.181
No, it's not.

07:10.306 --> 07:11.349
Really?

07:11.432 --> 07:12.892
Confident, ball-busting beauty

07:12.975 --> 07:14.977
who's always rolling her eyes at Logan?

07:16.479 --> 07:18.481
Trust me, that describes
more women than you think.

07:20.650 --> 07:23.611
"He looked at the stunning woman
who was his boss and said..."

07:24.403 --> 07:25.988
It's murder.

07:27.323 --> 07:29.117
Figure that out yourself, genius?

07:30.785 --> 07:32.495
Okay, no need to be snarky.

07:32.703 --> 07:36.958
- Who would want to kill him?
- Could be anyone. Dr. Silvers.

07:39.043 --> 07:40.545
Dr. Prakash.

07:42.547 --> 07:44.298
Hans the janitor.

07:47.009 --> 07:48.261
But the door is locked,

07:48.344 --> 07:50.429
so it has to be someone in this room.

07:50.513 --> 07:52.431
Wow, you are on fire.

07:56.060 --> 07:58.354
Maybe it is a little like Penny.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.022
Any chance she'll be flattered?

08:00.481 --> 08:02.233
I don't know. She's pretty mean.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.026
Ilsa or Penny?

08:04.110 --> 08:05.361
Exactly.

08:09.949 --> 08:11.492
Oh, hey, Howard. What's up?

08:11.784 --> 08:13.119
I'm so sorry.

08:13.244 --> 08:14.829
What for?

08:16.330 --> 08:17.623
Hello.

08:18.457 --> 08:19.792
Hello, Sheldon.

08:20.126 --> 08:21.419
I suppose you've come here to tell me

08:21.502 --> 08:23.880
that you've moved me
to your super secret enemies list.

08:25.298 --> 08:27.633
I don't have
a super secret enemies list.

08:27.717 --> 08:28.885
I'm not a Bond villain.

08:29.886 --> 08:33.306
I'm just a regular guy
with a regular enemies list,

08:34.307 --> 08:37.518
which, by the way, you are no longer on.

08:37.685 --> 08:40.605
Really? Well, that is something.

08:40.730 --> 08:43.441
It's not something that I care about,
but it is something.

08:43.941 --> 08:45.818
He's trying to say he's sorry.

08:45.943 --> 08:47.069
I am.

08:47.153 --> 08:50.323
I watched your show,
and it's really good.

08:50.573 --> 08:51.574
Oh, thank you.

08:51.657 --> 08:53.826
And I regret how hard I was on you.

08:53.910 --> 08:55.203
I want you to know

08:55.286 --> 08:57.663
that being on the <i>Professor Proton</i> show

08:57.747 --> 08:59.540
has been a childhood dream of mine.

08:59.665 --> 09:01.500
So, if you're ever looking

09:01.584 --> 09:05.296
for any more scientist guests,
I hope you'll consider me.

09:05.671 --> 09:08.674
Well, I appreciate that, Sheldon,
and I'll keep it in mind.

09:09.342 --> 09:11.510
- You know, actually...
- Yay!

09:11.636 --> 09:15.181
Oh... Uh... No. No. I want to have

09:15.264 --> 09:17.683
more female scientists
represented on the show,

09:17.892 --> 09:20.603
and I thought maybe Amy
might be interested?

09:30.696 --> 09:34.951
You... Or wouldn't it be nice

09:35.076 --> 09:38.496
to have us both on to show

09:38.579 --> 09:41.540
that even female scientists
can land a man?

09:46.212 --> 09:47.630
I said, "Sorry."

09:54.762 --> 09:56.639
So what do you think?

09:56.722 --> 09:59.725
Oh, I like it. I can't wait
to see who the killer is.

09:59.809 --> 10:02.436
Is it that Ilsa girl?
She seems pretty mean.

10:02.895 --> 10:06.899
Mm... But adorably mean,
like a baby lion?

10:08.985 --> 10:11.153
No, regular mean, like a regular lion.

10:13.030 --> 10:15.449
But it seems pretty accurate,
considering who you based it on.

10:16.075 --> 10:17.285
Huh.

10:17.493 --> 10:19.620
And who do you think that is?

10:21.372 --> 10:22.665
But the door is locked,

10:22.748 --> 10:24.917
so it has to be someone in this room.

10:27.795 --> 10:30.381
Wow. You are on fire.

10:32.842 --> 10:33.843
Oh, you...

10:34.218 --> 10:35.761
Bernadette. Yeah, sure.

10:37.179 --> 10:39.140
Each one of you had a motive.

10:39.390 --> 10:41.559
Who died and made you detective?

10:41.684 --> 10:43.060
He did.

10:44.687 --> 10:47.189
I think you're neglecting
your own motive,

10:47.273 --> 10:49.400
a massive inferiority complex.

10:49.984 --> 10:51.527
It's not massive.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.821
It's just average-sized.

10:56.449 --> 10:59.535
I don't mean to interrupt, but somebody
is tracking blood everywhere, so...

10:59.618 --> 11:01.245
Never mind, it's me.

11:03.122 --> 11:04.957
You say we're all suspects.

11:06.125 --> 11:08.002
How do we know you're not the killer?

11:08.169 --> 11:09.545
I have an alibi.

11:09.712 --> 11:12.715
Yeah. He's not smart enough
to pull off a murder like this.

11:15.426 --> 11:18.554
It's pretty obvious.
Blonde, mean, glasses.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.473
- It doesn't say "glasses."
- Really?

11:20.556 --> 11:23.142
But it will because Ilsa does.

11:23.225 --> 11:25.102
And you know who else wears them?

11:25.353 --> 11:26.729
Bernadette.

11:28.314 --> 11:31.025
And that's her 'cause it's...
It's totally her.

11:36.322 --> 11:39.241
- Oh, Amy. Good, you're here.
- Hi. What's up?

11:39.325 --> 11:43.037
How would you like to be on television?

11:44.163 --> 11:45.539
Is it gonna be a news story

11:45.623 --> 11:47.833
where I have to say you were
quiet and kept to yourself,

11:47.917 --> 11:49.460
and I'm as shocked as anyone?

11:50.669 --> 11:52.338
No, it's not.

11:52.630 --> 11:56.258
Wil Wheaton wants you to be
on <i>Professor Proton.</i>

11:57.259 --> 12:00.096
That's nice, but I'm not
really interested.

12:00.554 --> 12:01.639
What do you mean?

12:01.722 --> 12:03.599
But he wants to talk
about women in science.

12:03.682 --> 12:06.310
Uh, you're a woman. You're in science.
You go, girl.

12:07.436 --> 12:09.522
I'm all for promoting women in science,

12:09.605 --> 12:12.108
but I don't really want to be
on Wil's show.

12:13.192 --> 12:15.194
Is it because kids may be there,

12:15.277 --> 12:17.655
and they're known carriers
of head lice? I get that.

12:19.365 --> 12:21.325
Sure, that's the reason.

12:21.409 --> 12:23.369
I... Wait a minute.

12:23.452 --> 12:26.038
You're always bragging that lice
aren't attracted to you

12:26.122 --> 12:28.916
because your scalp is so oily.
That was on your dating profile.

12:30.084 --> 12:31.502
Okay, look,

12:31.669 --> 12:34.588
I know you have strong feelings
about <i>Professor Proton,</i>

12:34.672 --> 12:36.590
and I don't want to get
in the middle of that.

12:37.842 --> 12:39.927
So you're not going to do something

12:40.010 --> 12:41.762
just because you think
it might upset me?

12:42.471 --> 12:44.014
Well, it's tricky

12:44.098 --> 12:46.100
because answering that question honestly

12:46.183 --> 12:49.687
is one of the things I tend
not to do because it upsets you.

12:50.146 --> 12:51.772
Well, that's very upsetting.

12:53.482 --> 12:55.109
Like I said.

12:56.402 --> 12:58.988
What other things
don't you do because of me?

12:59.989 --> 13:01.407
Remember last week, when we went

13:01.490 --> 13:04.034
to that dueling piano bar
I was so excited about?

13:04.577 --> 13:06.579
- No.
- Well, now you're getting it.

13:10.875 --> 13:12.835
Boy, I don't know how people
who aren't on bed rest

13:12.918 --> 13:14.587
keep up with the Kardashians.

13:15.463 --> 13:17.047
Well, sometimes
you have to read in your car

13:17.131 --> 13:18.966
while your husband thinks
you're working late.

13:20.968 --> 13:23.637
Speaking of which, he came by
yesterday to show me his book.

13:24.805 --> 13:27.349
Oh, and, and what did you think?

13:27.433 --> 13:28.601
I liked it.

13:28.684 --> 13:31.061
Really? The Ilsa character
didn't bother you?

13:31.228 --> 13:33.606
Oh, he was exaggerating.
You're not really like that.

13:35.816 --> 13:38.360
Well, I know I'm not like that.

13:38.611 --> 13:40.613
The character was based on you.

13:40.905 --> 13:42.114
I don't know what to tell you.

13:42.198 --> 13:44.366
When I brought it up with Leonard,
he said it was you.

13:44.617 --> 13:46.994
Well, when I brought it up, he

13:47.244 --> 13:48.913
got all squirrelly and left the room.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.206
Son of a bitch.

13:54.543 --> 13:57.338
I just learned
some very distressing news.

13:57.421 --> 13:59.632
Sometimes, Amy doesn't do things

13:59.715 --> 14:01.634
because she's worried about
how I'll react.

14:02.009 --> 14:04.261
First of all, it's not sometimes.
It's always.

14:05.554 --> 14:08.015
Second, it's not Amy. It's everybody.

14:09.183 --> 14:11.644
And third, it's not news.
It's well-established.

14:12.770 --> 14:14.855
Yeah. Like, just now,
I wanted to get a croissant,

14:14.939 --> 14:17.066
but I didn't want to hear
you say, "Ooh, la, la."

14:19.193 --> 14:21.278
Uh, so you're saying
everyone walks on eggshells

14:21.362 --> 14:22.655
to spare my feelings?

14:22.738 --> 14:24.448
No, of course not, because we don't want

14:24.532 --> 14:26.242
to hear you complain about
how much you hate the sound

14:26.325 --> 14:27.618
of crunching eggshells.

14:29.245 --> 14:32.081
I don't want my relationship
with Amy to be like that.

14:32.164 --> 14:34.959
Sheldon, Amy knew
what she was getting into.

14:35.292 --> 14:37.378
- You think?
- Yes, we warned her.

14:39.505 --> 14:41.924
Well, regardless, I can change.

14:42.174 --> 14:44.385
- Yeah, of course you can.
- Sure.

14:45.052 --> 14:47.179
You know, everybody thinks
I'm so predictable.

14:47.263 --> 14:49.265
Well, tomorrow,
I'm gonna show up at work

14:49.348 --> 14:51.100
and do something no one will expect.

14:51.225 --> 14:53.185
Wear a baseball cap backwards
to prove your point?

14:58.774 --> 15:00.484
Yes, but which hat?

15:01.860 --> 15:03.112
Gryffindor.

15:04.738 --> 15:06.532
Well, now that you guessed it,
I'm not gonna do it.

15:07.575 --> 15:08.659
Yeah, you will.

15:09.618 --> 15:10.661
Yeah.

15:22.172 --> 15:24.008
Looks like the bullet
went right through you.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.884
Damn it, Logan. When are you gonna stop?

15:26.093 --> 15:28.887
Sorry. I didn't get my PhD in quitting.

15:30.514 --> 15:33.225
But you're a physicist. What makes
you think you can solve a crime?

15:33.309 --> 15:34.810
He's losing a lot of blood.

15:34.893 --> 15:36.895
Great. I'm gonna have to clean that up.

15:38.939 --> 15:42.818
You know what? A little soda water
might get that right out.

15:43.861 --> 15:45.904
- We've got to find some bandages.
- No.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.406
There's no time.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.286
Does it hurt?

15:52.620 --> 15:54.371
Everything you do hurts.

15:57.207 --> 15:59.418
Then why do you keep
coming back for more?

16:05.549 --> 16:08.135
- Hey.
- So this is what you think of me?

16:08.218 --> 16:10.763
I'm mean, and everything I do hurts you?

16:11.096 --> 16:12.389
What are you talking about?

16:12.473 --> 16:14.141
I know I'm Ilsa.

16:14.224 --> 16:16.477
What... That is crazy.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.062
You-you two are totally different.

16:18.228 --> 16:21.857
- How?
- Well, you... She...

16:22.691 --> 16:23.984
Her name's Ilsa.

16:25.569 --> 16:26.570
You know what?

16:26.695 --> 16:27.988
It's fine. Write whatever you want.

16:28.072 --> 16:30.699
And by the way, Logan Dean
can tell everyone he's 5'8",

16:30.783 --> 16:32.284
but he's not fooling anybody!

16:43.545 --> 16:45.464
Are you sure that's the move
you want to make?

16:45.631 --> 16:46.882
Absolutely.

16:48.133 --> 16:49.176
Okay.

16:51.220 --> 16:52.554
Checkmate.

16:54.139 --> 16:55.891
Oh, I did not see that coming.

16:57.226 --> 16:59.103
That's well played, Amy.

16:59.895 --> 17:01.313
What's going on?

17:02.398 --> 17:05.901
You beat me, and I am responding
with humility and admiration.

17:05.984 --> 17:07.361
What does it look like?

17:07.861 --> 17:09.780
You let me win so you could show me

17:09.863 --> 17:12.449
how emotionally mature you are,
didn't you?

17:12.950 --> 17:14.451
Well, I couldn't wait for you
to actually beat me.

17:14.535 --> 17:15.619
That would take forever.

17:17.454 --> 17:19.039
I'm sorry. It's, uh...

17:19.206 --> 17:21.792
I'm trying to show you
that I can change.

17:22.042 --> 17:25.087
I-I don't want you to miss out
on things because of me.

17:26.046 --> 17:27.464
I know you don't.

17:27.589 --> 17:29.550
You know, and maybe somewhere out there,

17:29.633 --> 17:32.970
there is a little girl
who will see you on Wil's show

17:33.095 --> 17:35.389
and realize that she, too, can grow up

17:35.472 --> 17:39.059
to be a brilliant, amazing,
successful scientist.

17:41.311 --> 17:42.438
Thank you.

17:42.521 --> 17:44.857
Who is really terrible at chess.

17:46.358 --> 17:49.027
- Got it.
- No, no, no. I mean, really bad.

17:49.111 --> 17:51.739
What was your queen doing
over there, going shopping?

17:55.576 --> 17:58.120
Well, I mean, I didn't intend
to write about Penny,

17:58.203 --> 18:00.748
but I guess maybe subconsciously I did.

18:00.831 --> 18:03.208
I believe you mean
"unconsciously," dear.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.879
Yeah, sure. You know, it would be nice

18:06.962 --> 18:08.839
if you didn't correct me all the time.

18:08.922 --> 18:10.674
It would be nice if I didn't have to.

18:12.468 --> 18:15.095
Maybe this book of yours is a bad idea.

18:15.596 --> 18:17.681
- What do you mean?
- Well, you're a physicist.

18:17.765 --> 18:19.808
What makes you think
you can write a book?

18:25.439 --> 18:26.815
You're a physicist.

18:26.899 --> 18:29.735
What makes you think
you can solve a crime?

18:32.488 --> 18:35.032
- Got to go.
- I think you mean "have..."

18:37.117 --> 18:38.368
Oh, hey, Penny, good news.

18:38.452 --> 18:39.828
- It's not you.
- What?

18:39.995 --> 18:41.663
Ilsa. It's not you. It's my mother.

18:41.747 --> 18:43.582
I've been writing about my mother!

18:44.625 --> 18:46.835
I think you're neglecting
your own motive,

18:46.919 --> 18:49.379
a massive inferiority complex.

18:49.546 --> 18:50.923
It's not massive.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.050
It's just average-sized.

18:57.763 --> 18:59.306
We've got to find some bandages.

18:59.389 --> 19:01.058
There's no time.

19:05.604 --> 19:06.772
Does it hurt?

19:06.939 --> 19:09.066
Everything you do hurts.

19:10.067 --> 19:12.277
Then why do you keep
coming back for more?

19:12.486 --> 19:13.862
Maybe you like it.

19:15.113 --> 19:16.824
I... Maybe I do.

19:22.496 --> 19:25.833
You know what? I'm a physicist.
What am I doing, writing a book?

19:32.256 --> 19:33.715
Well, that is our show for today.

19:33.799 --> 19:35.676
And I want to say
a very special thank you

19:35.759 --> 19:37.511
to Dr. Amy Fowler for being here.

19:37.594 --> 19:39.263
It was a real pleasure having you.

19:39.388 --> 19:40.889
And you can feel that pleasure

19:40.973 --> 19:45.269
because you don't have a lesion
in your nucleus accumbens.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.230
I really hope I don't.

19:49.147 --> 19:50.816
All right, we'll see you next time!

19:53.861 --> 19:55.112
Amy.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.572
You were glowing.

19:57.072 --> 19:58.824
Stop.

19:59.324 --> 20:01.118
Oily scalp.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.162
I'm so proud of you.

20:05.038 --> 20:06.832
And I'm proud of you.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.251
Because you can't tell how jealous I am?

20:09.835 --> 20:11.336
No, no, no. I can.

20:12.838 --> 20:15.465
But I can tell how hard
you're trying to keep it in.

20:15.632 --> 20:17.175
Really hard.

20:19.511 --> 20:20.596
I'm gonna go to bed.

20:20.679 --> 20:21.722
All right, I'm gonna go scream
on the roof.

20:21.805 --> 20:23.473
- Love you.
- Love you.

21:01.053 --> 21:02.054
English - SDH
