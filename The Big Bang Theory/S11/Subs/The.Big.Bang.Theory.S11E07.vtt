WEBVTT

00:04.214 --> 00:05.423
Hey, uh, who's free tonight?

00:05.674 --> 00:07.342
- Oh, I think I'm...
- Hang on,

00:07.634 --> 00:09.135
we've made this mistake before.

00:09.552 --> 00:11.846
It's how we wound up
at his cousin Deepak's Tupperware party.

00:13.390 --> 00:16.601
Hey, you use that collapsible bowl
all the time and you know it.

00:17.894 --> 00:19.145
And it's not like that,

00:19.229 --> 00:21.106
I just thought we could, you know,
hang out and go to a bar.

00:21.606 --> 00:22.816
- Very well.
- That sounds fun.

00:22.941 --> 00:23.942
And watch cricket.

00:25.819 --> 00:28.613
That sound you hear?
Ironically, crickets.

00:30.782 --> 00:32.534
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Bert, how you doing?

00:32.867 --> 00:33.868
Well, you know,

00:34.035 --> 00:37.247
we geologists always get a little sad
when Rocktober's over.

00:39.499 --> 00:40.792
- Wordplay?
- Yes.

00:40.917 --> 00:42.335
- Funny wordplay?
- What do you think?

00:42.460 --> 00:43.461
Eh.

00:43.628 --> 00:44.629
Trust your gut.

00:45.880 --> 00:48.883
Sheldon, I've got these
four billion-year-old meteorites.

00:49.467 --> 00:52.345
I thought maybe they'd show signs
of neutrino interactions.

00:52.887 --> 00:55.432
I could really use someone like you
to help me with the math.

00:56.099 --> 00:59.769
Oh, so they would act as
natural dark matter detectors.

01:00.103 --> 01:02.147
- That sounds interesting.
- It does,

01:02.230 --> 01:03.523
but it's still geology.

01:05.692 --> 01:07.902
Sorry, Bert, I don't have time
to play rocks with you.

01:08.111 --> 01:09.571
I'm not asking you to play rocks.

01:09.779 --> 01:12.157
I'm asking you to collaborate
on a research project.

01:12.741 --> 01:13.825
Although, if there's time,

01:13.908 --> 01:16.369
I guess we could play a round of
zinc, zinc, piece of quartz.

01:18.997 --> 01:20.206
Does sound better than cricket.

01:21.750 --> 01:25.211
Uh, thank you for asking. Unfortunately,
I have real science to do.

01:25.336 --> 01:27.005
But you feel free to rock on.

01:27.213 --> 01:28.506
That's how you do it.

01:30.008 --> 01:31.009
All right.

01:31.384 --> 01:34.053
Sheldon, what are you doing?
Bert's one of the top guys in his field.

01:35.096 --> 01:38.057
And somewhere there's a mime
who's top in his field,

01:38.933 --> 01:41.060
but you don't see me rushing
to collaborate with him

01:41.144 --> 01:42.604
on new ways to be stuck in a box.

01:44.939 --> 01:46.983
Yeah, also something I would watch
instead of cricket.

01:59.537 --> 02:01.247
Oh, hello.

02:02.248 --> 02:03.249
Hey, Sheldon.

02:03.333 --> 02:05.001
Yeah, I've been thinking about it

02:05.084 --> 02:08.546
and I suppose I could help you
with your research.

02:09.047 --> 02:10.048
What changed your mind?

02:11.049 --> 02:13.301
Bert, I'm a gift horse.
Don't look me in the mouth.

02:14.427 --> 02:16.346
Sorry. I'm happy you wanna help out.

02:16.554 --> 02:18.598
If it's easier for you
we could just work at your office.

02:19.015 --> 02:20.809
What? No, no, no. Not in my office, no.

02:20.892 --> 02:22.477
Uh, let's do it here,

02:22.685 --> 02:23.853
in the evenings,

02:24.062 --> 02:25.647
after everyone's gone home.

02:27.065 --> 02:29.067
I just have to see
if my evenings are free.

02:29.526 --> 02:31.194
That's a joke. They are.

02:32.445 --> 02:34.239
Okay. Well, then I will see you tonight.

02:39.452 --> 02:40.453
You know what,

02:40.578 --> 02:42.121
close the blinds,
we can start right now.

03:14.153 --> 03:17.866
I don't get how you can enjoy cricket.
It makes no sense.

03:18.241 --> 03:19.784
Did you just come here to complain?

03:20.201 --> 03:22.078
Yeah. That's the sport of my people.

03:24.122 --> 03:27.000
Oh, that's Ravichandran Ashwin,
he's amazing.

03:27.208 --> 03:29.669
He makes Hardik Pandya look like
Bhuvneshwar Kumar.

03:31.087 --> 03:33.506
Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Save some syllables for the rest of us.

03:35.216 --> 03:38.011
Hey, I think that's
Bernadette's friend over there.

03:39.095 --> 03:41.347
Oh, yeah. Hey, Ruchi.

03:43.600 --> 03:44.893
I hope this isn't awkward.

03:45.184 --> 03:47.061
The last time we met
I kind of embarrassed myself.

03:47.437 --> 03:48.980
Hmm, let's see if you can
go two for two.

03:50.565 --> 03:51.566
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

03:51.733 --> 03:53.318
- Hi.
- Are you here by yourself?

03:53.401 --> 03:56.279
Yeah, I couldn't convince anyone
to come watch cricket with me.

03:56.738 --> 03:58.448
Tell me about it.
I had to drag this guy.

04:01.034 --> 04:02.452
You're more than welcome
to join us if you'd like.

04:02.577 --> 04:03.578
Thanks.

04:08.416 --> 04:09.542
What'd she say?

04:13.588 --> 04:15.340
Ah, that clears that up.

04:16.591 --> 04:18.635
She's telling the bowler
to bowl a yorker.

04:18.718 --> 04:20.303
It's the most brutal ball in cricket.

04:20.845 --> 04:23.932
I was at the match when Shoaib bowled
back-to-back yorkers.

04:24.265 --> 04:26.059
I was there too. What a coincidence.

04:26.559 --> 04:29.145
Well, there were 120,000 people
at that match, so...

04:29.646 --> 04:30.730
Yeah, India, right?

04:30.980 --> 04:33.858
Everywhere you go
there's like 120,000 people.

04:35.568 --> 04:37.362
So, what do you think of our chances
at the World Cup?

04:38.029 --> 04:41.366
Uh, World Cup. You know, it'll all
depend if Kohli's batting in form.

04:41.658 --> 04:44.327
I know, it doesn't even matter
how many all-rounders you have.

04:44.661 --> 04:45.745
Isn't that the truth.

04:45.870 --> 04:48.122
You know, I was the best leg spinner
in my high school.

04:48.331 --> 04:50.333
Yeah, like, I bowled the meanest googly.

04:50.917 --> 04:53.127
Speaking of googlies,
I'm gonna go.

04:56.714 --> 04:59.050
I've been modeling different types
of dark matter

04:59.133 --> 05:02.011
and the traces they would leave
on the zircon inside your meteorite.

05:02.971 --> 05:04.055
What's this one here?

05:04.472 --> 05:07.475
That's actually a dark matter model
of my own creation.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.143
I call it the Cooper Boson.

05:09.644 --> 05:12.021
Cool. I got to name a rock once.

05:12.438 --> 05:14.816
I named it Moderately Sedimented Shale.

05:16.985 --> 05:18.861
Guess I kind of pooped the bed
on that one.

05:22.657 --> 05:24.158
You know, Bert, I have got to say,

05:24.367 --> 05:26.828
this work has been
surprisingly engaging.

05:27.370 --> 05:28.579
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

05:31.582 --> 05:32.709
Hello, Amy.

05:33.793 --> 05:35.670
What do you mean, where am I?

05:35.920 --> 05:37.130
I'm in my office.

05:37.463 --> 05:40.758
No, I'm at your office
and you're not here.

05:41.175 --> 05:42.677
I thought I'd surprise you with dinner.

05:43.511 --> 05:45.638
Wait, for future reference,
the best surprises

05:45.722 --> 05:47.765
are the ones I know about
three days in advance.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.601
Where are you?

05:51.144 --> 05:53.646
I could say it's a surprise.
Doesn't feel so good, does it?

05:55.398 --> 05:57.567
Well, I have food.
I thought we could eat together,

05:57.692 --> 05:58.943
but I guess if you have other plans...

05:59.027 --> 06:01.029
What? I'm here!

06:04.657 --> 06:06.284
Exactly where I said I was.

06:06.617 --> 06:08.202
Let's eat.

06:12.331 --> 06:13.916
- Hello.
- Hey, buddy, what's up?

06:14.125 --> 06:16.669
Um, I need to talk to Penny alone.

06:22.383 --> 06:23.593
- What can I do for you?
- Just a minute,

06:23.676 --> 06:25.803
I wanna make sure Leonard can't hear us.

06:26.262 --> 06:27.972
I've got a box of cupcakes.

06:31.267 --> 06:32.560
Okay, we're good.

06:34.062 --> 06:35.521
I'm working with Bert,

06:35.980 --> 06:37.982
but I don't want anyone to find out.

06:38.566 --> 06:40.985
Well, you just told me,
so, strong start.

06:42.737 --> 06:44.405
Penny, this is serious.

06:44.572 --> 06:46.157
My reputation is on the line.

06:46.699 --> 06:49.035
What are people gonna think
when they see us collaborating?

06:49.744 --> 06:51.162
I don't know. "Poor Bert"?

06:53.581 --> 06:56.209
I am a respected theoretical physicist.

06:56.334 --> 06:58.878
I aspire to win a Nobel Prize someday.

06:59.170 --> 07:00.713
But no one is gonna take me seriously

07:00.797 --> 07:02.799
if they find out I've been
dabbling in geology.

07:03.299 --> 07:04.884
Well, why not? They're both sciences.

07:05.051 --> 07:06.511
And I know, because they're classes

07:06.594 --> 07:08.846
my high school counselor said
"weren't for me."

07:12.266 --> 07:13.559
They're very different.

07:14.060 --> 07:17.313
Physics answers the question,
"What is the nature of the universe?"

07:17.563 --> 07:20.775
And geology answers the question,
"What'd I just trip over?"

07:23.444 --> 07:25.238
All right, well,
then don't work with Bert.

07:25.404 --> 07:26.614
No, but I like the work.

07:26.697 --> 07:28.658
- Then work with him.
- Yeah, but I'm ashamed of the field.

07:28.825 --> 07:31.077
- Then don't work with him.
- Yeah, but we could prove dark matter.

07:31.202 --> 07:32.411
- Then work with him.
- But I just think that people...

07:32.537 --> 07:33.704
How many times are you gonna do this?

07:34.539 --> 07:36.082
My record is 14.

07:37.792 --> 07:40.378
Okay, this is about science,
why'd you come to me?

07:40.753 --> 07:43.464
Well, because it's also about
my reputation.

07:43.714 --> 07:46.759
And somehow,
you manage to hold your head high

07:46.843 --> 07:48.219
despite your checkered past.

07:51.347 --> 07:52.390
"Checkered past"?

07:53.015 --> 07:56.519
I's a figure of speech referring to
how sexually promiscuous you were.

07:59.188 --> 08:01.399
Really? Well, I've got
a figure of speech

08:01.482 --> 08:04.235
about how sexually promiscuous
you can go be with yourself.

08:08.239 --> 08:09.240
And what is it?

08:13.369 --> 08:14.829
Look, while Bernadette's on bed rest

08:14.912 --> 08:16.914
we're gonna have to divide and conquer.

08:16.998 --> 08:19.333
I've got one monitor for her,
one for the baby.

08:20.418 --> 08:21.460
Which do you want?

08:22.086 --> 08:23.921
I'll take the baby,
she's less emasculating.

08:26.424 --> 08:29.010
Good morning. Scones?

08:29.260 --> 08:31.053
- Ah, thanks.
- They're all for you,

08:31.137 --> 08:32.722
I already had breakfast at Ruchi's.

08:33.389 --> 08:35.141
You're kidding. You slept with her?

08:35.308 --> 08:37.143
Well, there wasn't
a lot of sleeping involved.

08:37.435 --> 08:39.437
I mean, she slept, I stayed awake.

08:39.520 --> 08:42.064
I was afraid of snoring
'cause I didn't have my special pillow.

08:43.566 --> 08:44.692
<i>Howard!</i>

08:44.775 --> 08:46.485
<i>Can you help me to the bathroom?</i>

08:46.569 --> 08:49.655
At least the romance
is still alive.

08:54.285 --> 08:55.494
So...

08:55.745 --> 08:56.871
You and Ruchi.

08:56.996 --> 08:58.456
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I know you liked her too.

08:58.539 --> 09:00.917
But we just bumped into each other
last night and hit it off.

09:01.292 --> 09:02.877
Hmm, no, that's fine.

09:03.002 --> 09:04.420
You're my friend and I'm happy for you.

09:04.795 --> 09:05.880
Oh, thank you, Stuart.

09:05.963 --> 09:08.257
Plus, I don't know how you're gonna
screw it up, but I know you will.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.302
What's there to screw up?

09:11.427 --> 09:12.595
She just wants to keep things casual.

09:12.803 --> 09:14.305
Oh, great. That's how you're gonna
screw it up.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.391
Hey, I can be casual.

09:18.100 --> 09:20.686
Mmm-hmm. I should get a haircut,
this thing's going south fast.

09:23.272 --> 09:25.191
So, Ruchi and I decided
to keep things casual.

09:29.779 --> 09:32.114
Wait... What? I can handle casual.

09:35.368 --> 09:36.786
Why do you keep doing that
with your face?

09:36.911 --> 09:38.537
Because you keep saying
stupid things with yours.

09:40.539 --> 09:41.916
Okay, fine,

09:41.999 --> 09:43.251
I'm not great at casual relationships

09:43.542 --> 09:44.752
and I don't wanna scare her off.

09:45.336 --> 09:46.337
All right.
Just give her some space, all right.

09:46.420 --> 09:47.713
Don't call, don't text, don't e-mail.

09:48.047 --> 09:51.425
That's crazy. What if I see a sunset
that reminds me of her?

09:54.845 --> 09:56.347
All right, when do you see her next?

09:56.472 --> 09:57.765
Uh, we're having dinner tonight.

09:58.266 --> 09:59.308
Okay,

09:59.558 --> 10:01.143
put a rubber band around your wrist

10:01.477 --> 10:04.647
and any time you start planning
your wedding or naming your children,

10:04.772 --> 10:07.191
I want you to stab yourself
in the hand with a fork.

10:12.405 --> 10:13.739
What's the rubber band for?

10:13.948 --> 10:14.991
To slow the bleeding.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.746
Hey, how's Bernadette handling bed rest?

10:21.163 --> 10:25.251
Well, she lies around all day
eating Mallomars and hollering at me,

10:26.419 --> 10:29.380
so her transformation from
my wife to my mother is complete.

10:32.591 --> 10:34.802
Congratulations, I know
that's what you were hoping for.

10:38.347 --> 10:40.725
Hey, Sheldon, you left your jacket
in my office last night.

10:40.891 --> 10:43.519
No, I didn't.
That's not my jacket.

10:43.936 --> 10:45.896
Then why does it say
"Property of S. Cooper,

10:45.980 --> 10:47.106
"stop touching it"?

10:48.691 --> 10:51.110
That sounds like someone named Scooper
doesn't want you touching his jacket.

10:53.404 --> 10:55.990
Are you guys working together
on that meteorite project?

10:56.073 --> 10:58.576
Yes, fine. You found me out.

10:58.868 --> 11:00.119
I'm doing geology.

11:00.244 --> 11:01.662
Just, please, don't tell anyone.

11:02.788 --> 11:04.081
Are you embarrassed of me?

11:04.415 --> 11:05.958
Oh, no, no, no. Not you.

11:06.167 --> 11:08.419
No, just the work that
you've devoted your entire life to.

11:10.713 --> 11:13.674
If you're ashamed to be working with me
then I don't wanna work with you.

11:16.427 --> 11:17.928
Sheldon, that was pretty rude.

11:18.471 --> 11:20.431
Yeah, well, what do you expect,
he's a geologist.

11:27.396 --> 11:28.814
- This place seems nice.
- Yeah, uh,

11:29.315 --> 11:31.734
but not too nice.
Yelp called it "good for groups."

11:33.819 --> 11:35.696
- Would you care to buy the lady a...
- No! Get out of here.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.534
Sorry about that.

11:40.659 --> 11:42.870
I just... I hate when someone assumes
two people are dating

11:42.953 --> 11:45.623
just because they look like they would
make beautiful babies together.

11:47.249 --> 11:48.626
Are you sure you're okay with this?

11:49.001 --> 11:50.169
Honestly, Ruchi,

11:50.294 --> 11:52.963
I don't have a lot of experience
with casual relationships.

11:53.547 --> 11:55.758
I have some experience
with serious relationships

11:55.925 --> 11:58.302
and a ton of experience
with no relationships.

12:01.430 --> 12:03.974
- You're funny.
- Glad it came off that way.

12:05.059 --> 12:07.395
Uh, so, tell me about your day.

12:07.520 --> 12:08.854
How's work going?

12:09.230 --> 12:12.566
Well, I spent the morning reviewing
side effects for our fungal cream,

12:12.650 --> 12:14.193
so it was lot of ooze and pus...

12:24.578 --> 12:29.041
And then I had to catalog it by color,

12:29.834 --> 12:31.502
viscosity

12:31.836 --> 12:35.339
and percentage of blood.

12:41.762 --> 12:42.972
Sounds wonderful.

12:48.060 --> 12:49.145
- Hey.
- Hmm.

12:50.396 --> 12:51.522
Whatcha got there?

12:52.940 --> 12:54.066
A rock.

12:56.152 --> 12:58.028
Did some mean boys throw it at you?

13:00.281 --> 13:02.116
It turns out I'm the mean boy.

13:02.825 --> 13:05.536
Although I did drop it on my own foot,
so, kind of.

13:07.413 --> 13:08.456
What's going on?

13:09.707 --> 13:11.625
What if there was something
I wanted to do,

13:12.126 --> 13:15.045
but I was worried other people
would think less of me?

13:15.754 --> 13:18.340
Is that other person me
and does it happen in the bedroom,

13:18.424 --> 13:19.592
in which case, I think I'm cool with it?

13:24.513 --> 13:25.514
No.

13:27.349 --> 13:29.185
It's about working with Bert on...

13:29.351 --> 13:30.728
You know what,
I'm not even gonna say it.

13:30.811 --> 13:33.397
I am just gonna say
the letter it starts with

13:33.647 --> 13:34.815
and "ology."

13:34.940 --> 13:36.525
G... Oh, no, that's not gonna work.

13:39.528 --> 13:41.030
- Geology?
- Yes.

13:41.864 --> 13:44.909
But we parted ways because
I was worried about my reputation.

13:46.118 --> 13:47.119
Sheldon,

13:47.453 --> 13:48.996
you've never cared what people thought.

13:49.705 --> 13:51.999
Even when you really, really should.

13:54.418 --> 13:56.629
That dinner with my parents
comes to mind.

13:57.796 --> 14:00.549
If I'm not gonna use "your momma" jokes
when I meet your mother,

14:00.633 --> 14:02.343
why'd I bother to learn them?

14:05.221 --> 14:06.472
I'm just saying,

14:06.931 --> 14:09.058
if you think the work is interesting,

14:09.141 --> 14:10.434
nothing else should matter.

14:12.311 --> 14:13.479
You're right, Amy.

14:14.230 --> 14:15.814
That is sage advice.

14:16.482 --> 14:19.068
Which is surprising considering
your momma is so dumb, she...

14:19.151 --> 14:20.361
Nope.

14:24.114 --> 14:26.033
She studied for a urine test.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.791
I was supposed to go back
to India and get married,

14:34.250 --> 14:35.793
but I realized it wasn't what I wanted.

14:36.293 --> 14:38.462
So I called off the engagement
and moved out here.

14:39.129 --> 14:41.006
Well, if he wasn't your soulmate,
he wasn't your soulmate.

14:41.757 --> 14:44.009
Oh, God, please tell me
you're not one of those.

14:45.553 --> 14:46.637
One of what?

14:46.929 --> 14:48.597
I wanna say "teenage girls,"

14:48.806 --> 14:50.015
but that sounds mean.

14:50.975 --> 14:53.852
Come on. You don't believe that
everyone has one perfect match?

14:54.353 --> 14:56.605
Of course not. That's ridiculous.

14:57.022 --> 14:59.483
I mean, what if your soulmate
lived halfway across the world?

14:59.608 --> 15:01.610
- You'd never meet.
- Yes, you would.

15:01.694 --> 15:03.028
I can give you, like, 20 examples

15:03.112 --> 15:04.488
where that happened
to Kate Hudson alone.

15:06.574 --> 15:08.951
You know what, people get upset
when I talk about this.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.035
Let's just change the subject.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.579
No, no, no. No, it's fine.

15:12.413 --> 15:15.374
Are you saying that you don't believe
two people fall in love?

15:15.749 --> 15:18.085
Of course, they do.
It's just that what people call "love"

15:18.252 --> 15:20.921
is actually a series of
biochemical reactions in the brain

15:21.088 --> 15:22.089
that fade over time.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.968
Ah, yes. Like the old song,

15:26.093 --> 15:28.596
<i>When a Man Has a Biochemical Reaction
for a Woman.</i>

15:30.806 --> 15:32.099
Raj, we're scientists.

15:32.224 --> 15:34.435
We don't need to feel threatened
just because we understand

15:34.518 --> 15:36.854
the mechanisms that give rise
to romantic feelings.

15:37.813 --> 15:39.732
It doesn't take anything away
from the experience.

15:40.024 --> 15:41.191
Yes, it does.

15:41.275 --> 15:43.402
Actually, it takes everything
away from it.

15:43.611 --> 15:45.946
Love isn't just science, okay.

15:46.030 --> 15:47.364
It's spiritual.

15:47.531 --> 15:50.326
It's an acknowledgment of a mystery
that's greater than ourselves.

15:50.451 --> 15:53.162
It's what makes people
write songs and poems

15:53.370 --> 15:56.498
and what has kept <i>The Bachelor</i> on TV
for 21 magical seasons.

15:58.626 --> 15:59.710
Don't you think the fact

15:59.793 --> 16:02.087
that love is given away
as a prize on a game show

16:02.212 --> 16:03.672
slightly undermines your argument?

16:04.673 --> 16:07.092
Uh, yes, but I've
never missed an episode

16:07.217 --> 16:08.886
and I dare science to explain that.

16:13.098 --> 16:15.142
Bert? Bert, Bert?

16:15.893 --> 16:17.227
Bert, Bert, Bert?

16:19.313 --> 16:20.356
What do you want, Sheldon?

16:20.522 --> 16:22.733
I would like us to work together again.

16:22.983 --> 16:26.362
And I promise to keep
my geology comments to myself

16:26.570 --> 16:28.489
because while some of them are funny,

16:28.572 --> 16:29.782
all of them are mean.

16:32.368 --> 16:34.328
Well, this is awkward.

16:40.584 --> 16:42.044
Leonard, what are you doing here?

16:42.419 --> 16:43.504
Bert asked for my help.

16:43.796 --> 16:45.422
Yeah. He's an excellent scientist

16:45.547 --> 16:47.925
and he doesn't tell me
what time I can go to the bathroom.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.595
It's called bladder training,

16:51.762 --> 16:53.764
and when you're in your 80s
you'll thank me for it.

16:54.973 --> 16:58.185
Look, Sheldon, you were a jerk to Bert,
and he walked away from you.

16:58.310 --> 17:00.521
So I feel like there's a lot
he could teach me.

17:02.731 --> 17:03.732
Bert, please.

17:04.066 --> 17:06.735
I know I behaved poorly
in the past,

17:07.111 --> 17:09.154
but things will be different this time.
You'll see.

17:09.655 --> 17:10.739
Come on.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.032
Let me in.

17:14.535 --> 17:15.828
We'll have some laughs,

17:16.161 --> 17:18.205
we'll calculate some isotope ratios.

17:22.793 --> 17:23.919
I'm sorry, Sheldon.

17:27.506 --> 17:29.383
So, you just shut the door in his face?

17:29.466 --> 17:31.009
I gotta start writing this stuff down.

17:34.722 --> 17:35.889
I mean, Ruchi is nice,

17:36.014 --> 17:37.266
we're just so different.

17:37.641 --> 17:40.310
I know. Sometimes when you're dating
you meet weird people.

17:40.436 --> 17:42.479
I once met a girl
who didn't like juggling.

17:43.313 --> 17:44.565
And she still doesn't.

17:47.860 --> 17:49.069
So you're not gonna see her again?

17:49.486 --> 17:52.030
What's the point? We're never
gonna be in a real relationship.

17:52.364 --> 17:54.950
Right. So you'll only be
in a physical one?

17:55.075 --> 17:57.286
Exactly. Why would I wanna spend time
with someone like that?

17:57.494 --> 17:59.955
Someone who is just interested in sex?

18:01.039 --> 18:02.124
Yeah.

18:03.542 --> 18:05.210
- Raj, do you really...
- Wait! Hold on, give him a chance.

18:05.294 --> 18:06.336
He's gonna get this.

18:09.673 --> 18:10.799
I don't think he is.

18:12.217 --> 18:13.385
What is there to get?

18:13.510 --> 18:14.553
She doesn't want to fall in love.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.305
At that point, all we are

18:16.388 --> 18:18.724
is two single people who find
each other attractive and enjoy having...

18:19.099 --> 18:20.225
Oh, gotta go.

18:27.024 --> 18:28.233
So, how was your night with Ruchi?

18:28.400 --> 18:30.861
Oh, great. We ordered in some food,

18:30.944 --> 18:32.446
we had sex, I left.

18:32.613 --> 18:34.072
I didn't even ask if she enjoyed it.

18:36.158 --> 18:37.409
I can field that one for her.

18:39.453 --> 18:41.705
I mean, I did get a little misty
when we said goodbye,

18:41.872 --> 18:43.207
but I played it off as allergies.

18:43.373 --> 18:44.374
I don't know if she bought it.

18:44.875 --> 18:46.126
Again, I know.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.005
Sheldon?

18:50.881 --> 18:51.924
You okay?

18:52.216 --> 18:53.217
Sheldon.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.175
English - SDH
