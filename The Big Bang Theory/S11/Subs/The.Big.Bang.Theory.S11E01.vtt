00:02.045 --> 00:03.672
<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

00:04.339 --> 00:07.467
I was offered a summer research
fellowship at Princeton.

00:08.259 --> 00:09.511
A fine institution.

00:10.220 --> 00:12.430
The place where Albert Einstein taught.

00:12.847 --> 00:16.142
And where Leonard got his PhD,
so it may have gone downhill.

00:17.477 --> 00:19.562
Gentlemen, you may remember
Dr. Nowitzki,

00:19.688 --> 00:21.981
she's back at Caltech for her post-doc.

00:22.232 --> 00:23.400
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:23.983 --> 00:25.026
Question,

00:25.902 --> 00:28.405
are you seeking
a romantic relationship with me?

00:29.197 --> 00:30.198
What if I were?

00:31.241 --> 00:33.410
Well, that would raise
a number of problems.

00:33.785 --> 00:36.371
We're colleagues,
I'm currently in a...

00:41.459 --> 00:44.671
<i>Amy.
Amy. Amy.</i>

00:58.309 --> 00:59.310
Will you marry me?

01:03.148 --> 01:04.190
One moment please.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.610
Really, you're gonna
answer that right now?

01:08.111 --> 01:10.071
It's Leonard, I don't want to be rude.

01:11.531 --> 01:13.241
- Hello?
- Hey, where you been?

01:13.324 --> 01:14.576
We've been calling you for hours.

01:14.826 --> 01:17.454
I'm sorry,
my phone was on airplane mode.

01:17.537 --> 01:18.538
Why?

01:19.164 --> 01:20.707
Because I was on an airplane.

01:22.751 --> 01:23.835
Hey, put him on speaker.

01:23.918 --> 01:25.545
- Yeah.
- Hey. Where are you?

01:25.962 --> 01:27.839
<i>I came to Princeton to see Amy.</i>

01:28.006 --> 01:29.924
It's a funny story actually.

01:30.133 --> 01:32.719
I was having lunch with Dr. Nowitzki

01:32.886 --> 01:34.971
- and she kissed me.
- Excuse me?

01:35.054 --> 01:36.181
I'm sorry?

01:37.515 --> 01:39.934
Wait, and in that moment I realized that

01:40.059 --> 01:42.604
Amy was the only woman
I ever wanted to kiss

01:42.812 --> 01:44.189
for the rest of my life.

01:44.606 --> 01:47.859
So, I came to New Jersey
to ask her to marry me.

01:48.276 --> 01:49.861
Oh, that's so sweet.

01:50.195 --> 01:51.362
Sheldon.

01:51.571 --> 01:54.866
Yeah, although there was one man
whose blessing I needed first.

01:56.117 --> 01:57.285
I've thought about it

01:57.410 --> 02:01.039
and I really wanna spend
the rest of my life with Amy.

02:02.373 --> 02:03.666
Do I have your blessing?

02:04.292 --> 02:05.668
<i>Well, Sheldon,</i>

02:08.171 --> 02:11.090
<i>I think you should make
her finger like Saturn</i>

02:11.299 --> 02:12.842
<i>and put a ring on it.</i>

02:15.220 --> 02:18.223
You asked Stephen Hawking
and not her father?

02:18.640 --> 02:20.225
Stephen Hawking's a genius.

02:20.350 --> 02:23.061
If he said no, I wasn't gonna waste
my time on her father.

02:24.938 --> 02:26.397
But you did ask my father?

02:26.564 --> 02:28.608
Mm-hmm, I did, he said, "Yes."

02:28.691 --> 02:31.069
Although not in a robot voice
so it wasn't nearly as cool.

02:32.028 --> 02:34.447
Okay, oh, my God, I can't believe
you guys are engaged!

02:34.531 --> 02:35.740
<i>We're not engaged yet,</i>

02:35.907 --> 02:37.325
she's taking forever to answer.

02:37.534 --> 02:38.868
Because you're on the phone!

02:41.746 --> 02:42.831
We'll call you back.

02:48.878 --> 02:49.879
<i>She said, "Yes."</i>

02:49.963 --> 02:50.964
- Yay!
- Congratulations!

03:19.826 --> 03:21.661
Mother, I have some good news to share.

03:21.744 --> 03:23.454
We're engaged!

03:24.956 --> 03:28.001
I am so happy for you two.
But I'm not surprised.

03:28.084 --> 03:29.294
I've been praying for this.

03:29.502 --> 03:31.254
Well, God had nothing to do with it.

03:31.421 --> 03:33.965
It happened because
I was kissing another woman

03:34.257 --> 03:37.302
and it made me realize
I wanted to be with Amy.

03:37.677 --> 03:39.637
More than one woman
was interested in you?

03:39.721 --> 03:41.180
I might have prayed a little too hard.

03:43.099 --> 03:45.268
I just... I wanna
let you know right now

03:45.351 --> 03:47.145
that we are not getting married
in a church.

03:47.312 --> 03:51.024
That's all right, Sheldon,
anywhere Jesus is is a church.

03:51.190 --> 03:52.442
Well, he won't be at our wedding.

03:52.734 --> 03:55.653
He's in my heart,
so if I'm there he'll be there.

03:56.905 --> 03:59.198
Okay, well, then he's your plus one,
you don't get to bring anyone else.

04:00.199 --> 04:01.618
That's fine, love you.

04:01.910 --> 04:03.036
All right, love you too, bye.

04:04.704 --> 04:05.955
Lord, thank you.

04:06.581 --> 04:11.210
Even though you can do anything,
that was mighty impressive.

04:13.212 --> 04:14.422
We're engaged.

04:14.714 --> 04:16.466
Oh, my God, that's amazing!

04:16.633 --> 04:18.217
Wait, tell me everything.

04:18.384 --> 04:20.762
Well, Dr. Nowitzki was kissing me...

04:20.887 --> 04:22.513
Oh, you can stop leading
with that part of the story.

04:24.766 --> 04:27.518
Well, congratulations,
I'm so happy for you two.

04:27.602 --> 04:29.270
Hold on, I have to tell Bernadette.

04:29.479 --> 04:30.730
Hey, Bernie, guess what,

04:30.897 --> 04:33.274
Sheldon and Amy got engaged!
Can you believe it?

04:33.691 --> 04:34.817
Oh, my God.

04:35.610 --> 04:36.903
I cannot believe it.

04:39.614 --> 04:42.617
She's so happy,
I think she's crying.

04:46.245 --> 04:48.706
Do you think Sheldon's gonna want
some weird <i>Star Trek</i> wedding?

04:51.084 --> 04:52.085
I don't know.

04:52.669 --> 04:55.588
Well, Leonard could barely finish
the words "Doctor Who wedding cake"

04:55.672 --> 04:57.006
before I shut that down hard.

04:59.258 --> 05:00.343
Mm-hmm.

05:01.177 --> 05:02.303
Are you listening to me?

05:02.762 --> 05:04.263
Yeah, you're mean to Leonard,
I heard you.

05:06.224 --> 05:07.475
Is everything okay?

05:08.226 --> 05:10.687
Look, I'm gonna
tell you something,

05:10.853 --> 05:12.647
but you can't freak out,
because I'm already freaking out.

05:13.690 --> 05:14.857
Oh, my God, what is it?

05:15.566 --> 05:17.110
I'm pregnant again.

05:17.318 --> 05:18.528
Wha...

05:25.493 --> 05:26.619
Interesting.

05:29.956 --> 05:31.457
Howard's gonna lose his mind.

05:31.791 --> 05:32.917
Wait, you haven't told him yet?

05:33.334 --> 05:35.253
- No.
- So you told me first?

05:35.336 --> 05:36.546
Oh, Bernie.

05:38.756 --> 05:40.967
This wasn't supposed to happen.
We were careful.

05:41.217 --> 05:43.011
I didn't even think you could get
pregnant while you were breastfeeding.

05:43.386 --> 05:44.887
Well, guess what, you can.

05:46.723 --> 05:48.516
Hey, look, this is a good thing.

05:48.599 --> 05:51.019
Halley's gonna have
a little brother or sister to play with.

05:52.145 --> 05:53.688
I guess that would be pretty cute.

05:53.855 --> 05:55.732
And, you know,
I was a surprise to my parents,

05:55.815 --> 05:58.359
and my dad said it was the best thing
that ever happened to them.

05:59.027 --> 06:01.904
Okay, maybe this baby
actually is a blessing.

06:02.196 --> 06:04.574
Oh, my God, honey, of course it is.

06:06.534 --> 06:08.494
- How am I pregnant again?
- Yeah, what were you thinking?

06:13.207 --> 06:15.501
All right.
I'm all checked into my flight.

06:16.502 --> 06:17.795
Well I'm sad you're leaving,

06:18.046 --> 06:19.756
why'd you only book a flight
for one day?

06:20.423 --> 06:22.133
I came here to propose.

06:22.675 --> 06:23.760
If you'd said "No,"

06:23.843 --> 06:25.887
I wouldn't want to stick around
looking at your stupid face.

06:28.639 --> 06:32.143
Now, mind you, your face is only stupid
in the "no" version of the story.

06:33.603 --> 06:35.980
But I said, "Yes,"
so I get a lifetime of this.

06:37.315 --> 06:38.691
Yes, you do, smart face.

06:40.526 --> 06:41.903
Why don't you stay a few extra days?

06:42.695 --> 06:44.238
Well, I don't have any other clothes.

06:44.655 --> 06:45.656
We'll get you some.

06:45.865 --> 06:47.366
I don't know, I'm pretty particular.

06:47.950 --> 06:50.286
Well, there's a comic book store
less than a mile from here.

06:50.536 --> 06:51.788
Perfect, let's go shopping.

06:53.122 --> 06:56.459
Oh, um, and I'm having dinner
with some colleagues tonight,

06:56.542 --> 06:58.127
I'm sure they'd love to meet you.

06:58.377 --> 07:00.671
- Aw.
- Come on. What do you say?

07:00.838 --> 07:03.007
Aw, you're nagging me.

07:04.467 --> 07:05.885
It's like we're already married.

07:07.095 --> 07:10.348
- Is that a "yes" or a "no"?
- Geez, save some for the honeymoon.

07:14.102 --> 07:15.353
Look at Nowitzki over there.

07:16.229 --> 07:18.564
Can't believe she tried to steal
Sheldon from Amy.

07:19.232 --> 07:22.318
You know what? I'm gonna go there
and tell her that they're engaged now

07:22.401 --> 07:23.945
and that her little plan didn't work.

07:24.195 --> 07:25.404
Because you're sticking up for Sheldon,

07:25.488 --> 07:27.240
or because you're still mad
she rejected you?

07:27.448 --> 07:28.825
Too far away, can't hear you.

07:31.244 --> 07:33.204
- Hello, Ramona.
- Hello.

07:33.955 --> 07:35.748
Why are you sitting by yourself?

07:36.499 --> 07:40.545
Oh, that's right, Sheldon's
in New Jersey, being engaged to Amy.

07:42.421 --> 07:43.422
I heard.

07:43.548 --> 07:45.091
Now that Sheldon's out of the picture,

07:45.174 --> 07:47.552
I could give you one more chance
to go out with me.

07:49.595 --> 07:50.763
Nope, I'm good.

07:53.850 --> 07:55.101
You sure?

07:55.977 --> 07:57.436
I will not ask again.

07:58.729 --> 08:00.189
I sincerely hope not.

08:02.608 --> 08:05.528
Very well. I'm going to leave
before this gets awkward.

08:10.449 --> 08:12.660
Hey. Want me to make dinner?

08:12.952 --> 08:14.954
All right. Sure, but first,
why don't you have a seat.

08:15.037 --> 08:16.289
There is something I need to show you.

08:16.998 --> 08:21.169
Ooh, if it's "How to make dinner"
that'd be great.

08:28.718 --> 08:29.802
Is this a...

08:30.178 --> 08:31.220
pregnancy test?

08:32.221 --> 08:33.222
Yes.

08:36.642 --> 08:37.810
That means...

08:38.936 --> 08:39.979
positive?

08:41.439 --> 08:42.607
Yes.

08:43.900 --> 08:45.568
No.

08:49.030 --> 08:52.241
- Yes.
- Oh, no, no.

08:54.744 --> 08:55.912
Yes.

08:57.288 --> 08:58.289
No.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.087
How could this even happen?

09:05.171 --> 09:07.298
I mean, we were careful.

09:07.381 --> 09:08.382
Well, it did.

09:08.591 --> 09:09.800
- No! No!
- Yes! Yes!

09:09.884 --> 09:11.510
- No! No! No!
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

09:11.594 --> 09:14.180
Okay, okay, okay, well, wh...
what are... what are we gonna do?

09:14.430 --> 09:15.473
What do you mean,
"What are we gonna do?"

09:15.556 --> 09:16.557
We're gonna have another baby.

09:16.641 --> 09:18.100
- No.
- Stop that!

09:18.184 --> 09:19.894
- No! I'm trying!
- Yes.

09:22.480 --> 09:24.774
Look, I know it's scary,

09:25.608 --> 09:27.151
but we're both responsible adults,

09:27.276 --> 09:28.402
we can do this.

09:28.527 --> 09:29.904
You really think so?

09:30.112 --> 09:31.155
Yeah.

09:31.781 --> 09:32.949
No!

09:37.662 --> 09:38.663
Hey, Stuart.

09:38.746 --> 09:40.414
Oh, hey, Raj, what can I help you with?

09:40.623 --> 09:42.500
I need to buy an engagement gift.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.752
Well, you came to the wrong place.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.463
It's for Sheldon and Amy.

09:47.630 --> 09:49.048
No way, they're engaged?

09:49.298 --> 09:51.175
- Yeah.
- Ah, that's exciting news.

09:51.676 --> 09:54.679
Who would've thought Sheldon and Amy
would be the next two to tie the knot.

09:55.054 --> 09:57.598
Tell me about it.
I'm the one who caught the bouquet

09:57.682 --> 09:59.100
at Leonard and Penny's wedding.

10:00.685 --> 10:02.436
Okay, uh, you know,

10:03.145 --> 10:04.522
they might like this,

10:06.065 --> 10:08.776
Superman and Wonder Woman.
It's kinda romantic.

10:09.235 --> 10:10.403
Mm.

10:10.987 --> 10:12.113
You know what,

10:12.238 --> 10:13.447
why am I buying them a gift?

10:13.698 --> 10:16.117
They have love,
screw them and their happiness.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.244
What do you have for someone
who's bitter and alone?

10:20.538 --> 10:21.872
Literally, everything.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.795
Sheldon, these are the heads
of my research team.

10:28.296 --> 10:29.505
- Hello.
- Dr. Zane, Dr. Harris,

10:29.588 --> 10:31.299
this is my fiancé,
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

10:31.882 --> 10:34.343
That's the first time I've said that
and it kinda gave me the goosebumps.

10:36.262 --> 10:38.848
Dr. Cooper, we are so excited
to meet you.

10:38.931 --> 10:40.516
Oh, well that's very kind of you.

10:40.641 --> 10:44.520
If you'd like, I could
autograph your menus after dinner. Yeah.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.022
But I better not see those on eBay.

10:47.773 --> 10:49.275
No, no, no. We're, we're just excited

10:49.358 --> 10:51.610
to meet the man
who landed this brilliant woman here.

10:51.736 --> 10:53.779
Oh, that wasn't hard,

10:53.863 --> 10:55.197
she threw herself at me.

10:57.074 --> 10:59.952
Now getting the universe
to show me its naughty bits,

11:00.077 --> 11:01.495
that took some doing.

11:02.997 --> 11:04.623
Sheldon's a physicist.

11:05.291 --> 11:06.584
- Oh.
- That's nice.

11:10.629 --> 11:12.006
Amy, I recently read your paper

11:12.089 --> 11:14.467
on lesions in the olfactory receptors
in the brain.

11:14.550 --> 11:16.385
It was inspired.

11:16.719 --> 11:18.804
Well, I guess it didn't stink.

11:19.055 --> 11:20.806
But if it did, that rat wouldn't
have known it.

11:22.433 --> 11:24.518
I'm sorry, I'm sure
you don't wanna sit here

11:24.602 --> 11:26.020
and listen to a bunch of work talk.

11:26.312 --> 11:28.439
Oh, no, I love it.
Let's talk about work.

11:28.564 --> 11:30.107
Amy's work, my work,

11:30.232 --> 11:31.567
yeah, why don't we start with my work?

11:33.027 --> 11:34.820
Actually, I do have a question
for Dr. Cooper.

11:35.488 --> 11:38.616
When Amy first told you
about her approach to synaptic tracing,

11:38.866 --> 11:41.077
did you think it was gonna
revolutionize the field?

11:42.203 --> 11:43.496
Really,

11:43.788 --> 11:45.039
that's your question?

11:45.414 --> 11:46.832
What are you, <i>Entertainment Tonight?</i>

11:48.834 --> 11:50.336
You know what?
I'm gonna give you a better question.

11:50.586 --> 11:52.213
Here, "Dr. Cooper,

11:52.380 --> 11:56.092
"I heard you were working on a top
secret project for the U.S. Military,

11:56.175 --> 11:57.218
"why don't you tell us about that?"

11:57.301 --> 11:59.136
See, that's a great question.

12:00.304 --> 12:02.306
Okay, what was that like?

12:02.890 --> 12:04.600
Well, I can't tell you that,
it's top secret.

12:12.817 --> 12:15.027
Boy, that was exhausting.

12:15.611 --> 12:17.988
And no offense, but your colleagues
were pretty rude.

12:20.241 --> 12:22.576
- Really, they were rude?
- Yes,

12:22.910 --> 12:25.538
they just kept talking about you
and how great you are

12:25.788 --> 12:27.665
no matter how many times
I brought me up.

12:29.125 --> 12:31.836
Well, these are my colleagues,
and they wanna talk about my work,

12:31.961 --> 12:33.462
why does that bother you so much?

12:34.088 --> 12:35.673
Because I was there.

12:36.173 --> 12:37.925
It's like having Optimus Prime
over to dinner

12:38.008 --> 12:39.718
and not asking him to turn into a truck.

12:41.971 --> 12:43.013
You know what, Sheldon?

12:43.180 --> 12:45.558
You're not always the smartest person
in every room.

12:45.975 --> 12:48.018
You may not even be the smartest person
in this room.

12:49.019 --> 12:50.104
Oh, I am sorry.

12:50.187 --> 12:52.356
What, is Neil Degrasse Tyson
hiding behind the couch?

12:53.357 --> 12:55.484
Because if he is, he's not that smart.
It's pretty dusty back there.

12:59.905 --> 13:00.990
Hey, where are you going?

13:01.365 --> 13:02.783
I'm storming off to my room.

13:03.033 --> 13:04.910
Wait, then where am I supposed
to storm off to?

13:04.994 --> 13:06.745
Well, you're so smart,
why don't you figure it out?

13:11.667 --> 13:13.085
Is there another bedroom?

13:14.837 --> 13:16.422
Perhaps a den?

13:20.843 --> 13:25.514
So, how are you guys doin'
with all the new events in your womb?

13:29.435 --> 13:32.480
Good, you know,
obviously it was a surprise.

13:33.272 --> 13:35.107
There was some crying
and some yelling...

13:35.357 --> 13:36.817
Some suggestion of make-up sex

13:36.901 --> 13:39.236
that did not go over well even though
it's not like we can get more pregnant.

13:43.199 --> 13:46.202
But then we realized
that it's a gift, in the sense that

13:46.577 --> 13:48.996
we didn't ask for it,
and we may not have chosen it...

13:49.121 --> 13:50.414
And we already have one.

13:53.918 --> 13:55.461
You know, whenever I find a top I like

13:55.544 --> 13:58.255
I always go back and get a second one
in a different color.

14:02.718 --> 14:04.845
Which I hope is not the case
with your baby.

14:07.806 --> 14:11.060
Uh, uh, I know you guys are freaked out
but you're great parents

14:11.310 --> 14:13.229
and if you ever need help
we are here for you.

14:13.312 --> 14:15.105
Yeah. Anything at all, just ask.

14:16.857 --> 14:18.275
Well, you know what you could do?

14:18.609 --> 14:19.944
You could have a baby, too.

14:24.823 --> 14:25.991
I'm sorry, what?

14:27.284 --> 14:29.745
Well, that's a great idea.
We could go through it together,

14:29.828 --> 14:30.829
wouldn't that be fun?

14:32.289 --> 14:35.417
You guys were just saying
how freaked out and miserable you are.

14:36.168 --> 14:39.463
I say a lot of crazy things,
I'm pregnant and hormonal.

14:41.131 --> 14:42.633
Do it, have a baby, do it!

14:44.677 --> 14:47.304
Come on, it'd be so cute,
our kids playing together.

14:47.388 --> 14:49.682
What do you say? Why don't you two hit
the old mattress and whip up a family?

14:51.100 --> 14:53.894
Okay, we're not gonna have a baby
just to make you guys feel better.

14:54.019 --> 14:57.106
Yeah, if we're gonna have a baby
it's gonna be when we are ready

14:57.189 --> 14:58.732
or when I'm certain
Penny's gonna leave me.

14:58.857 --> 15:00.109
Exactly.

15:04.029 --> 15:06.615
They're my friends,
and I should be happy for them.

15:06.740 --> 15:07.866
And I'm trying,

15:08.492 --> 15:12.079
but, all I feel is this, like,
gnawing empty sensation in my gut.

15:12.538 --> 15:13.998
- I had that once.
- Hmm.

15:14.373 --> 15:15.874
Turned out it was a tapeworm.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.005
Cool, uh...

15:22.298 --> 15:23.382
It's just...

15:23.674 --> 15:25.718
It's hard talking
to my other friends about this,

15:25.801 --> 15:26.969
but I knew you would understand.

15:27.469 --> 15:30.055
- Why is that?
- Because you and I are both alone,

15:30.264 --> 15:32.057
which is actually kind of comforting

15:32.141 --> 15:33.934
because at least
we can be alone together.

15:34.184 --> 15:37.479
Hmm, this is,
this is awkward. I, um,

15:37.813 --> 15:40.858
I was actually gonna close up a little
early tonight 'cause I have a date.

15:42.484 --> 15:44.069
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:46.155 --> 15:49.617
Forgive me if I'm having trouble
being happy for you.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.870
Don't be silly, I'm lovin' your pain.

15:57.499 --> 15:59.376
Is this how our marriage is going to be?

15:59.918 --> 16:03.005
Sometimes people will be more interested
in talking to her than to me?

16:03.422 --> 16:05.132
<i>Are you sitting in a bathroom?</i>

16:06.467 --> 16:08.052
Yes,

16:08.344 --> 16:11.513
I needed a place to storm off to
and it was all that was available.

16:13.015 --> 16:15.351
<i>Fine, but if I hear a flush</i>

16:15.517 --> 16:17.478
<i>this conversation is over.</i>

16:18.687 --> 16:21.774
Those people were in the presence
of a world-class mind

16:22.107 --> 16:24.401
and all they wanted to talk about
was their own nonsense.

16:25.402 --> 16:27.988
<i>Can you see the irony in that statement?</i>

16:30.991 --> 16:32.201
<i>How about now?</i>

16:35.454 --> 16:36.705
<i>How about now?</i>

16:40.000 --> 16:41.001
<i>I'll wait.</i>

16:44.296 --> 16:45.798
Oh, surprise.

16:46.215 --> 16:48.092
Oh, crap, is it our anniversary?

16:50.177 --> 16:51.220
No. Wait.

16:55.307 --> 16:56.642
- No.
- No. Okay.

16:57.101 --> 16:58.811
All right, so what are we celebrating?

16:58.894 --> 17:01.271
Well, Bernadette and Howard
are pregnant again,

17:01.647 --> 17:03.107
Amy and Sheldon are getting married,

17:03.232 --> 17:04.525
I didn't want you to feel left out.

17:04.650 --> 17:05.651
Oh.

17:05.734 --> 17:06.819
Left out?

17:06.902 --> 17:08.862
Well, Bernadette has to grow
a baby inside of her

17:08.946 --> 17:11.240
and Amy has to marry one.
My life is great!

17:14.034 --> 17:16.328
- So do you not want the cake...
- Try and take it away, see what happens.

17:20.624 --> 17:22.292
Oh, crap, it is our anniversary.

17:23.460 --> 17:24.753
Happy anniversary!

17:29.717 --> 17:30.759
Amy...

17:32.177 --> 17:33.721
There's something I need to say to you.

17:34.972 --> 17:36.014
I'm listening.

17:37.433 --> 17:39.351
I've been thinking about <i>The Avengers.</i>

17:42.479 --> 17:43.856
I believe that,

17:45.023 --> 17:47.067
but I don't think that's something
you needed to say to me.

17:48.485 --> 17:51.572
I realized that Iron Man is great.

17:52.197 --> 17:54.992
And also, that Captain America is great.

17:55.325 --> 17:58.746
And sometimes Iron Man
is in a Captain America movie

17:58.829 --> 18:01.832
and he's not mad
it's not an Iron Man movie.

18:01.915 --> 18:05.794
Now he can fly in, give the audience
a thrill, and then fly away.

18:06.754 --> 18:08.922
And that should have been me tonight.

18:09.882 --> 18:13.051
I should have been
the delightful cameo in your movie.

18:15.304 --> 18:16.305
Thank you, Sheldon.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.515
Instead, I was like the Hulk and I...

18:18.599 --> 18:20.225
Okay, please stop talking
about <i>The Avengers.</i>

18:22.603 --> 18:23.604
Anyway,

18:24.855 --> 18:25.939
I'm proud of you

18:26.440 --> 18:29.902
and I'm going to try to do a better job
of sharing the spotlight

18:30.194 --> 18:32.070
because we're a team,

18:32.654 --> 18:34.072
you know, much like...

18:35.365 --> 18:36.617
The Dodgers.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.497
If they had superpowers.

18:42.790 --> 18:43.999
And fought crime.

18:44.374 --> 18:45.751
And Thor was in them.

18:48.879 --> 18:50.672
Sheldon, I know this isn't easy,

18:52.007 --> 18:54.009
but, you'll have a whole lifetime
to practice.

18:55.093 --> 18:57.513
It could take that long,
I'm really bad at it.

19:01.517 --> 19:02.726
You know, maybe, um...

19:03.352 --> 19:05.020
I should start right now

19:05.729 --> 19:08.857
and go back to Pasadena and let you have
this experience to yourself.

19:10.484 --> 19:11.485
You just want to go back

19:11.568 --> 19:13.362
'cause that's where everybody
makes a fuss over you.

19:13.570 --> 19:15.739
You know, your colleagues are right,
you are brilliant.

19:23.872 --> 19:25.958
Hello.

19:26.041 --> 19:27.209
- Hey!
- Mm, hey, welcome back!

19:27.501 --> 19:28.627
Oh, let me see the ring.

19:29.419 --> 19:30.963
Ooh, nice.

19:31.046 --> 19:32.631
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
her eyes are up there.

19:35.926 --> 19:37.678
I-is that the woman who kissed Sheldon?

19:38.595 --> 19:39.638
Uh.

19:39.888 --> 19:40.931
- Could be.
- Hard to say.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.349
Tell us about Princeton.

19:43.767 --> 19:45.894
- Excuse me for a minute.
- Yeah. No, we'll catch up later.

19:47.229 --> 19:49.064
This is going to be
the biggest smackdown

19:49.147 --> 19:51.066
since my Aunt Noopur
showed up at the family reunion

19:51.149 --> 19:53.193
wearing the same sari
as my cousin Shruti.

19:56.405 --> 19:57.531
Dr. Nowitzki.

19:58.699 --> 19:59.783
Oh.

20:00.117 --> 20:01.869
Dr. Fowler,

20:02.286 --> 20:03.287
hello.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.331
Thank you. Thank you so much.

20:35.736 --> 20:36.737
English - SDH
