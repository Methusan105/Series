WEBVTT

00:03.922 --> 00:05.548
It feels like it wasn't that long ago

00:05.632 --> 00:07.342
we were here doing this for Halley.

00:07.842 --> 00:08.968
'Cause it wasn't.

00:10.845 --> 00:13.515
Which reminds me, before we leave,
let's get you a vasectomy.

00:16.101 --> 00:18.353
Well, that's sweet,
but today's all about you.

00:21.231 --> 00:23.525
So, you two ready to find out
the sex of this baby?

00:23.817 --> 00:24.901
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

00:25.360 --> 00:28.738
Is Halley hoping for a little brother
or a little sister?

00:28.947 --> 00:30.115
Well, she's nine months old.

00:30.198 --> 00:32.826
So unless it jingles or is in my bra,
she doesn't care.

00:34.911 --> 00:36.788
And how about you two?

00:37.664 --> 00:40.291
You know, for the first one,
we really wanted a girl,

00:40.375 --> 00:42.836
but this time around
we don't have a preference.

00:43.211 --> 00:45.797
Yeah. Boy, girl,
as long as it's healthy.

00:46.172 --> 00:48.425
Well, it's a boy.

00:50.427 --> 00:51.803
- Huh.
- Oh.

00:53.638 --> 00:56.015
Oh, come on,
you can't really be disappointed.

00:56.266 --> 00:58.184
Hey, I barely know
how to be a man myself.

00:58.351 --> 00:59.769
Now I have to teach someone?

01:00.562 --> 01:03.481
As the saying goes,
those who can't do, teach.

01:05.608 --> 01:07.277
Don't you want
a little version of Howard?

01:07.694 --> 01:09.237
I already have
a little version of Howard.

01:11.406 --> 01:13.116
Now, I'm having a son?

01:13.241 --> 01:16.035
I'll have to teach him
how to play sports

01:16.327 --> 01:18.371
and watch sports and...

01:18.997 --> 01:21.124
And, and, and, and...

01:21.624 --> 01:23.918
He just ran out of man things.
He's in trouble.

01:26.880 --> 01:28.298
It's okay. We're all here to help.

01:28.715 --> 01:32.218
Yes, and this baby will have
plenty of manly role models.

01:32.385 --> 01:35.597
Now, I'm certain that whatever
Bernadette can't teach him, Penny can.

01:38.183 --> 01:39.893
Uh, she can pee into a bottle.

01:40.143 --> 01:42.479
Mm-hmm. Anything with a neck
wider than a nickel.

01:44.731 --> 01:47.275
Howie, there's a lot of amazing things
you can teach a son.

01:47.400 --> 01:51.029
Yeah, you do always know
how to pick just the right antacid.

01:52.822 --> 01:55.742
I don't know if I can teach that.
It's just something I was born with.

01:57.160 --> 02:00.121
Come on. You can build things.
You were an astronaut.

02:01.039 --> 02:04.292
That's true. You know, as a kid
I used to make model rockets.

02:04.375 --> 02:05.752
That'd be pretty cool to do with a son.

02:06.127 --> 02:08.296
Model rockets!
Finally! Something interesting.

02:09.589 --> 02:11.549
What is your preferred mode of recovery?

02:12.217 --> 02:14.052
Sheldon, we're helping our friends.

02:14.594 --> 02:17.138
Yeah, and we got to model rockets.

02:17.472 --> 02:19.641
That was a tedious road,
but well worth the effort.

02:21.601 --> 02:22.685
So, have you thought of any names?

02:22.769 --> 02:24.187
Amy! We finally got to model rockets!

02:24.270 --> 02:25.271
Why are you turning back?

02:54.092 --> 02:55.844
- Hey, where you going?
- Back to the dry cleaner.

02:55.927 --> 02:59.138
Look at this. They didn't get the stain
out of my Starfleet uniform.

02:59.472 --> 03:02.100
Well, if you didn't make me wear
the green body paint in bed,

03:02.183 --> 03:03.768
you wouldn't have to
get it dry cleaned so much.

03:06.104 --> 03:07.105
Nah, it's worth it.

03:09.941 --> 03:10.942
Hey, wait. It's your mom.

03:11.234 --> 03:12.694
Uh-oh, too bad she just missed me.

03:17.532 --> 03:18.533
Hey, Beverly.

03:18.741 --> 03:19.868
<i>Oh, hello, Penny.</i>

03:20.118 --> 03:23.454
Uh, Leonard just left. He's going to be
so upset he missed your call.

03:23.997 --> 03:24.998
<i>Why?</i>

03:26.416 --> 03:27.667
Because he...

03:28.001 --> 03:29.460
Yeah, I don't know. How are you?

03:30.712 --> 03:32.839
<i>Did you mean personally
or professionally?</i>

03:33.298 --> 03:36.301
Um, personally.
Like, what'd you do last night?

03:36.593 --> 03:38.928
<i>I had Cuban food at the home of a man</i>

03:39.012 --> 03:41.306
<i>with whom I shared
unsatisfying intercourse.</i>

03:45.018 --> 03:46.769
Wow. Okay.

03:49.272 --> 03:51.482
<i>And to anticipate your next questions,</i>

03:51.566 --> 03:53.902
<i>roasted pork and sideways missionary.</i>

03:57.572 --> 03:59.991
Sure, sure. 'Cause you were full.

04:03.161 --> 04:05.580
I haven't looked
at all this stuff in years.

04:06.205 --> 04:08.041
Had it. Had it.

04:08.750 --> 04:10.251
Burned down my garage with it.

04:11.711 --> 04:13.463
I had three model rockets as a kid.

04:13.546 --> 04:15.590
And that was the largest
space program in India.

04:17.342 --> 04:19.302
You have a replica Saturn V?

04:19.677 --> 04:23.139
Yeah. My dad bought it
before he, you know,

04:23.348 --> 04:24.682
abandoned our family.

04:25.141 --> 04:26.434
Lucky duck.

04:28.811 --> 04:31.731
Could never bring myself
to open it without him.

04:31.814 --> 04:33.232
It's silly.

04:33.691 --> 04:36.694
No, it's not silly. I always wanted
my dad to build rockets with me

04:36.778 --> 04:38.237
but he wasn't interested.

04:38.488 --> 04:40.490
Ah, yes. Disappointing fathers.

04:40.698 --> 04:41.741
Tell me about it.

04:41.950 --> 04:44.827
I remember for my 16th birthday,
my dad bought me a Mercedes,

04:45.328 --> 04:47.664
like, a little one, like,
a starter Mercedes.

04:49.290 --> 04:52.293
He had barely handed me the keys
before he had to rush back to work.

04:52.460 --> 04:53.920
I didn't see him again till, like,

04:54.170 --> 04:55.672
pretty late that night.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.218
Anyway,

05:02.720 --> 05:05.473
as angry as I was with him leaving,

05:06.015 --> 05:08.810
building this stuff is probably
what led me to become an engineer.

05:09.644 --> 05:11.521
I suppose, in his own way,

05:11.604 --> 05:13.856
my dad also encouraged me
to pursue science.

05:14.107 --> 05:16.651
I mean, he is the one that taught me
that flatulence is combustible.

05:19.070 --> 05:21.656
And also, polyester gym shorts
don't burn.

05:22.824 --> 05:23.825
They melt.

05:25.827 --> 05:27.996
Yeah, I guess
I'm an astrophysicist because

05:28.204 --> 05:30.123
as a kid I said
I like to look at the stars

05:30.707 --> 05:33.209
so my dad sent me to Hawaii
to visit the Keck telescope.

05:36.796 --> 05:38.339
Screw you, my pain is real.

05:42.885 --> 05:44.637
You know what? Forget the past.

05:45.388 --> 05:47.765
What do you say
you and me build this rocket?

05:48.683 --> 05:51.561
That sounds like it could be
a real bonding experience for us.

05:51.811 --> 05:52.812
Right?

05:53.229 --> 05:54.814
Oh, I see. You think that's a positive.

06:00.570 --> 06:02.613
So you didn't want to hang out
with Sheldon and Howard?

06:02.947 --> 06:05.324
No, they were bonding over
their sad childhoods

06:05.408 --> 06:07.702
and my stupid parents
were always there for me.

06:10.413 --> 06:11.539
What's all this?

06:11.622 --> 06:13.791
I'm just boxing up all the clothes
Halley's outgrown.

06:13.916 --> 06:15.376
Guess we won't need 'em anymore.

06:15.501 --> 06:19.047
Whoa, wha... slow it down. I'm sure
there's some you could reuse for a boy.

06:20.089 --> 06:21.132
"Daddy's little girl"?

06:22.884 --> 06:24.927
Okay, well, what if we, uh,
change it to say,

06:25.303 --> 06:27.430
"Daddy's little girl magnet"?

06:27.722 --> 06:28.931
Boom! Boy shirt.

06:31.309 --> 06:32.310
What about this?

06:32.477 --> 06:34.812
Uh, okay. Pull off the skirt,

06:34.896 --> 06:37.482
slap a lightning bolt on the front
and you got Baby Flash.

06:38.524 --> 06:42.487
Ooh, stick a long sleeve under it.
Boom! Baby Sheldon.

06:44.781 --> 06:46.032
Wow, you're really good at this.

06:46.491 --> 06:49.869
Oh, please. This isn't my first time
turning girl clothes into boy clothes.

06:52.038 --> 06:53.748
Why? You got your sister's
hand-me-downs?

06:54.916 --> 06:56.209
Yeah. That.

07:00.963 --> 07:03.007
Oh, I should've brought peanuts.

07:03.633 --> 07:05.301
You can't eat peanuts, you're allergic.

07:06.052 --> 07:08.054
If you die,
who's going to drive me home?

07:09.388 --> 07:11.682
No, I'm not gonna eat them,
it's a thing they do at JPL.

07:11.849 --> 07:14.060
When the Ranger Mission
finally had a successful launch,

07:14.185 --> 07:16.062
there were peanuts in the room.
Ever since then,

07:16.479 --> 07:17.855
they have them at every launch.

07:18.648 --> 07:20.274
That sounds like a silly superstition.

07:21.109 --> 07:22.819
It's more of a tradition.

07:23.111 --> 07:25.363
Oh! I do love a tradition.

07:26.697 --> 07:28.825
Could you pull over
at the next peanut store?

07:30.701 --> 07:31.994
I don't think that's a real thing.

07:32.370 --> 07:34.831
Oh, don't be pedantic,
any nut store will do.

07:36.582 --> 07:39.585
Uh, I don't think we can get
peanuts out here.

07:39.919 --> 07:41.504
Well, then this whole day's ruined.

07:43.673 --> 07:46.551
Now that I think about it,
maybe it is more of a superstition.

07:46.968 --> 07:48.636
Phew, that was close.

07:57.353 --> 08:00.064
Oh, hey, Beverly,
you called my phone, not Leonard's.

08:00.690 --> 08:03.442
Actually, I was hoping
to speak with you.

08:03.526 --> 08:04.735
Is this a good time?

08:05.820 --> 08:08.281
Uh, that depends.
What time is it where you are?

08:08.489 --> 08:09.490
Just after 5:00.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.785
Yeah, that counts. What's up?

08:15.371 --> 08:17.832
Well, I enjoyed our conversation
the other day

08:17.915 --> 08:19.792
and I was hoping to continue it.

08:20.126 --> 08:21.127
Really?

08:21.460 --> 08:23.296
<i>Yes. You may find this surprising,</i>

08:23.546 --> 08:26.549
but I don't have a lot of
what you would call "girlfriends."

08:27.592 --> 08:28.926
What?

08:31.387 --> 08:33.848
Of course,
there are my female colleagues,

08:33.931 --> 08:35.892
but they're all Freudians,

08:36.225 --> 08:39.145
so the only boy
that I can dish about is my father.

08:46.235 --> 08:48.613
Well, you know, I'm here for you.
What do you wanna talk about?

08:49.113 --> 08:52.033
Well, last time we focused on my life.

08:52.116 --> 08:55.912
If we're going to be real girlfriends,
we should talk about you as well.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.122
Well, you know,
if we're going to be real girlfriends,

08:58.206 --> 09:00.291
we should get a third girl
we can trash behind her back.

09:02.585 --> 09:04.754
Oh, so we'd be catty.

09:04.962 --> 09:06.380
I like it.

09:07.465 --> 09:10.968
What about Sheldon's fiancée?
She seems a bit dour.

09:13.721 --> 09:16.557
Ooh, "Dour." Meow.

09:21.854 --> 09:23.314
All right, here we go.

09:23.731 --> 09:25.900
L-minus ten, nine...

09:25.983 --> 09:27.985
Wait, what are you doing? It's T-minus.

09:28.527 --> 09:30.363
I was an astronaut, we used L-minus.

09:31.239 --> 09:32.657
Yeah, but this is a Saturn V

09:32.865 --> 09:34.492
and when they launched those,
they said T-minus.

09:34.617 --> 09:36.285
It's my rocket, we're doing it my way.

09:38.621 --> 09:39.622
Fine.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.334
I'm not saying I know why your dad left

09:43.417 --> 09:44.752
but I think I'm getting an idea.

09:47.755 --> 09:52.009
L-minus ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

09:52.093 --> 09:53.427
'Cause you're kind of bossy.

09:55.680 --> 09:59.100
Five, four, three, two, one.

10:05.106 --> 10:07.191
Yeah, I remember them going up higher.

10:13.155 --> 10:14.156
Well, that's perfect.

10:14.240 --> 10:15.700
I mean, the one thing
I thought I could

10:16.284 --> 10:18.494
do with my son,
I can't even do that right.

10:18.995 --> 10:20.871
If you wanna see it again,
I got it on video.

10:22.373 --> 10:23.791
Looks pretty cool in slow motion.

10:25.459 --> 10:26.794
Thank you for your support.

10:26.961 --> 10:28.796
- You're welcome.
- I was being sarcastic.

10:29.130 --> 10:30.214
How dare you.

10:33.050 --> 10:34.427
Sheldon, what am I gonna do?

10:36.053 --> 10:38.764
What do I know
about raising a boy?

10:40.349 --> 10:42.059
What do you know about raising a girl?

10:44.520 --> 10:46.856
Oh, my God, you're right.

10:48.190 --> 10:50.735
Well, I don't know
if that was sarcasm or not, so,

10:51.235 --> 10:53.154
either you're welcome, or hey!

11:01.912 --> 11:04.040
Leonard, did you really
just text me from the couch

11:04.123 --> 11:05.958
to put extra mustard on your sandwich?

11:07.918 --> 11:09.420
I was worried
you might not check your e-mail.

11:13.382 --> 11:15.134
I swear to God I will throw this out.

11:15.593 --> 11:16.886
That one was not me.

11:17.553 --> 11:18.846
Oh, wait, it's just your mom.

11:19.638 --> 11:20.639
My mother's texting you?

11:20.973 --> 11:22.266
Yeah, we've been talking a lot lately.

11:23.184 --> 11:24.185
Why?

11:25.394 --> 11:27.730
Is she sick of talking
to the magic mirror on the wall?

11:29.899 --> 11:32.485
No, I think she's lonely.
She's been reaching out.

11:33.694 --> 11:35.863
Okay, just be careful.

11:36.447 --> 11:38.991
You think you're getting close to her,
the next thing you know,

11:39.325 --> 11:40.326
you're featured in a book called

11:40.409 --> 11:43.245
<i>He's Doing It On Purpose:
Raising a Teenage Bedwetter.</i>

11:45.498 --> 11:46.999
No, it's not like that.

11:47.083 --> 11:49.085
You know, she's been opening up
about her life

11:49.168 --> 11:51.337
and she's actually been
really supportive about mine.

11:52.046 --> 11:53.255
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:53.339 --> 11:55.966
I've been telling her about my job
and she said she was proud of me.

11:57.635 --> 11:58.719
That's great.

12:01.639 --> 12:03.391
Never told me she was proud of me.

12:05.601 --> 12:07.603
Even when I stayed dry
for a whole month.

12:10.314 --> 12:11.816
Do you not want me
to be friends with your mom?

12:12.316 --> 12:15.528
Well, the... Let's be clear,
I married you to hurt her.

12:19.782 --> 12:20.908
You're kinda ruining it.

12:24.829 --> 12:26.956
Reason number 13 to feel good.

12:27.581 --> 12:29.583
As a launch, it was bad,

12:29.750 --> 12:32.253
but as an explosion, it was glorious.

12:34.130 --> 12:35.714
Reason 14,

12:35.965 --> 12:37.675
you still have all your fingers

12:38.050 --> 12:40.469
and boys prefer a dad with fingers.

12:42.054 --> 12:45.099
Thanks for trying, but you're not gonna
be able to cheer me up.

12:45.850 --> 12:47.476
Well, how about this, then?

12:47.560 --> 12:50.563
You quit your whining before I give you
something to cry about, young man.

12:52.398 --> 12:53.482
What?

12:53.774 --> 12:56.360
Those are comforting words
my father would often say.

12:57.945 --> 12:58.946
Did it help?

12:59.697 --> 13:01.866
I turned out great. You tell me.

13:04.201 --> 13:05.202
Let's get going.

13:05.870 --> 13:07.663
Are you gonna be this mopey
all the way home?

13:07.955 --> 13:09.290
I don't know. Maybe.

13:09.748 --> 13:13.252
There any chance you'd be cheered up
by an amazing trigonometry riddle?

13:15.671 --> 13:16.839
Well, if you can't answer that,

13:16.922 --> 13:18.299
there's no way
you're going to get this riddle.

13:26.015 --> 13:28.058
Oh, hey. Hey, what do you think?

13:29.268 --> 13:30.352
Just because it's a boy,

13:30.436 --> 13:32.938
I don't think you need to put a picture
of genitals on his shirt.

13:34.106 --> 13:36.901
What? That's a baseball bat
with two little baseballs.

13:37.318 --> 13:38.694
Okay, yeah, now I see it.

13:41.947 --> 13:43.073
So, you know,

13:43.199 --> 13:46.285
I understand why Howard
is nervous about having a son,

13:46.702 --> 13:47.745
but are you really upset about it?

13:48.287 --> 13:49.288
No, I'm fine.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.874
It's just, I grew up
with a bunch of brothers, so,

13:52.166 --> 13:54.043
I thought it'd be nice
for Halley to have a sister.

13:54.251 --> 13:55.294
Is that wrong?

13:55.669 --> 13:57.129
Of course, it's wrong.

13:57.505 --> 13:59.256
You don't know what this little boy
is gonna be like.

13:59.548 --> 14:01.300
Maybe he'll be rough and tumble

14:01.383 --> 14:03.844
or maybe he'll be sweet and sensitive

14:04.011 --> 14:05.804
or maybe he'll be
all those things, like me.

14:09.475 --> 14:10.768
You're rough and tumble?

14:12.811 --> 14:14.188
You bet I am, bitch.

14:17.733 --> 14:20.069
But I'm also sensitive
and regret saying that.

14:26.742 --> 14:27.868
- Hey.
- Hello.

14:28.786 --> 14:29.787
You got a sec?

14:30.871 --> 14:31.872
Sure, what's up?

14:32.748 --> 14:34.833
Penny's been talking to my mother
like they're best friends

14:34.917 --> 14:36.377
and it's kind of freaking me out.

14:37.586 --> 14:38.587
Okay.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.924
I'm pretty sure
they're not best friends.

14:46.345 --> 14:48.722
'Cause you can only have
one best friend,

14:50.933 --> 14:53.352
and Penny has that, and it's me.

14:56.063 --> 14:57.856
Oh, really? Is she facetiming
with you right now?

14:58.274 --> 14:59.525
Because she's facetiming with my mom

14:59.608 --> 15:01.860
and believe me, that is not a face
you want to spend time with.

15:04.488 --> 15:06.991
Hmm. Well, I have been
pretty busy lately.

15:07.658 --> 15:09.326
Maybe I've been
neglecting our friendship.

15:09.577 --> 15:11.787
Penny knows I have a complicated
relationship with my mother.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.163
It's like she doesn't even care.

15:13.247 --> 15:15.666
And with everything going on at the lab
and planning the wedding,

15:15.874 --> 15:17.459
I just, I have so little free time.

15:18.544 --> 15:20.963
Penny doesn't know how manipulative
my mother can be.

15:21.463 --> 15:24.258
Did you know there's such a thing as
reverse, reverse, reverse psychology?

15:24.383 --> 15:27.136
Because there is.

15:27.636 --> 15:29.388
I mean, she must feel so abandoned.

15:29.513 --> 15:31.140
She's used to me
being there all the time,

15:31.432 --> 15:33.976
but now I have my own life
and she's just gonna have to accept it.

15:34.059 --> 15:36.979
And why is my mom proud of Penny
and not me?

15:37.062 --> 15:38.063
I mean, the real question is,

15:38.147 --> 15:40.190
why is Penny so afraid of me
growing as a person?

15:40.316 --> 15:41.317
I'm good at stuff too.

15:41.442 --> 15:43.027
I deserve my own life!

15:46.905 --> 15:48.616
- Okay, well, thanks.
- Yeah, good talk.

15:55.706 --> 15:57.124
You know, studies have shown

15:57.207 --> 16:00.252
that people distracted
by emotional issues

16:00.336 --> 16:01.587
are poor drivers.

16:02.963 --> 16:06.008
What about people distracted
by irritating passengers?

16:08.135 --> 16:09.637
That would be hard to test

16:09.720 --> 16:12.473
because irritating is
a subjective quality.

16:13.098 --> 16:14.350
Strongly disagree.

16:20.773 --> 16:21.774
Can I drive?

16:22.524 --> 16:25.819
No, you can't drive,
you don't even have a license.

16:26.487 --> 16:27.613
Actually, I do.

16:28.364 --> 16:30.824
Really? Since when?

16:31.200 --> 16:32.201
Three years ago.

16:32.451 --> 16:34.745
I went on a bit of a license kick.

16:35.579 --> 16:37.331
I'm also a commercial fisherman.

16:38.957 --> 16:41.085
Then why don't you ever drive yourself?

16:41.835 --> 16:43.420
Honestly, I barely passed my test.

16:43.754 --> 16:45.214
And the one time I drove on my own,

16:45.422 --> 16:48.842
I made a U-turn, got dizzy,
threw up and walked home.

16:51.553 --> 16:53.138
You really want to drive?

16:53.639 --> 16:55.140
This seems like the perfect time.

16:55.307 --> 16:57.726
The roads are straight,
there's no one around

16:57.935 --> 16:59.853
and you don't seem to care
if you live or die.

17:02.481 --> 17:04.441
Live, Sheldon, I want to live.

17:05.317 --> 17:07.444
That makes things a little trickier,
but I'll do my best.

17:12.574 --> 17:14.785
<i>Hi, Pen... Oh, hello, Leonard.</i>

17:17.746 --> 17:18.789
Hello, Mother. How are you?

17:19.039 --> 17:20.124
<i>Fine, and you?</i>

17:20.290 --> 17:22.459
- I'm great.
<i>- Well, it's been lovely catching up.</i>

17:22.710 --> 17:25.671
No, no, no. Wait,
hang on, we need to talk.

17:26.088 --> 17:27.089
<i>Oh, brother.</i>

17:29.258 --> 17:30.384
I wanna know,

17:30.676 --> 17:32.052
why aren't you proud of me?

17:33.470 --> 17:36.682
<i>Well, isn't the real question,
why aren't you proud of yourself?</i>

17:37.057 --> 17:39.518
No. That is a question

17:39.727 --> 17:41.145
and I ask it a lot.

17:42.312 --> 17:44.231
But let's stick with the one
I asked you.

17:45.399 --> 17:46.817
<i>Well, why do you think
I'm not proud of you?</i>

17:47.776 --> 17:49.319
Because you never say it.

17:50.028 --> 17:51.613
But two days into chatting with Penny

17:51.697 --> 17:53.657
and you can't stop telling her
how great she is.

17:53.991 --> 17:55.159
<i>She is great.</i>

17:55.617 --> 17:58.245
<i>Honestly,
of all of my children's spouses,</i>

17:58.370 --> 18:00.456
<i>she's the one
that I'm most impressed by.</i>

18:02.249 --> 18:03.584
- Seriously?
<i>- Yes.</i>

18:03.959 --> 18:08.172
<i>She's confident, she's thoughtful
and she never complained about you once.</i>

18:08.630 --> 18:10.466
<i>I know what kind of strength that takes.</i>

18:13.051 --> 18:15.012
So, Penny's your favorite?

18:15.804 --> 18:17.055
<i>I suppose she is.</i>

18:17.723 --> 18:21.518
<i>You married well, Leonard,
and for that I am proud of you.</i>

18:25.022 --> 18:26.899
I don't... I don't...
I don't know what to say.

18:27.232 --> 18:30.527
<i>I'm also proud of
how hard you're trying not to cry.</i>

18:33.238 --> 18:34.239
Thank you.

18:35.115 --> 18:36.116
<i>Would you like to hang up now?</i>

18:36.283 --> 18:37.367
Yeah, here it comes.

18:45.918 --> 18:48.003
Your hands are at ten and two, good.

18:48.212 --> 18:50.130
Steady on the gas.

18:50.589 --> 18:51.840
Okay.

18:52.424 --> 18:55.677
Now you're gonna wanna
slowly switch lanes.

18:56.053 --> 18:57.054
Why?

18:57.179 --> 19:00.599
Because there are only two
and you're not in either of them.

19:05.729 --> 19:07.272
Attaboy. Well done.

19:07.648 --> 19:08.649
Thank you.

19:08.732 --> 19:12.444
Last time I drove,
I was terrified, but this is fun.

19:13.362 --> 19:14.488
You're doing great.

19:14.822 --> 19:16.073
You're a good teacher.

19:19.493 --> 19:22.037
Your son is going to be lucky
to have you as a father.

19:24.540 --> 19:25.541
Thanks.

19:28.544 --> 19:30.796
Do you think
I could try going a little faster?

19:32.297 --> 19:33.423
Go for it, champ.

19:33.632 --> 19:34.883
Ow.

19:36.510 --> 19:38.554
Sorry. Just ease on the gas and...

19:39.179 --> 19:40.764
Oh! Too much, too much!

19:40.848 --> 19:43.058
Why was I scared of this?
This is exhilarating.

19:43.350 --> 19:44.560
No, it's not! Slow down!

19:44.810 --> 19:46.311
Don't tell me what to do,
you're not my father.

19:57.698 --> 19:58.866
Do you know how fast you were going?

19:59.283 --> 20:00.284
A hundred and twelve.

20:03.453 --> 20:04.454
Let me see your license.

20:06.832 --> 20:08.166
- Okay, here's the plan.
- No.

20:10.794 --> 20:11.795
Fine.

20:12.588 --> 20:13.589
There you go.

20:16.133 --> 20:17.593
You know what, you can just keep it.

20:45.662 --> 20:46.663
English - SDH
