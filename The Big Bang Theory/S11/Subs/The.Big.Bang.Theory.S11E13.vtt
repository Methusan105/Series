WEBVTT

00:03.672 --> 00:06.508
Hey! Look what I got everybody.

00:06.633 --> 00:08.009
Newspapers?

00:08.093 --> 00:10.553
Did you find a portal back
to the 1990s?

00:11.846 --> 00:14.307
No. If he had that,
he'd be trying to prevent NSYNC

00:14.391 --> 00:15.767
from breaking up.

00:16.267 --> 00:17.686
Oh, please. I'm glad they broke up.

00:17.769 --> 00:20.522
Otherwise, Justin would
never have brought sexy back.

00:21.398 --> 00:24.234
One thing you can't get
on an iPad,

00:24.317 --> 00:26.403
the smell of ink and paper.

00:26.736 --> 00:29.030
One more reason
iPads are better.

00:29.614 --> 00:32.075
They reviewed
my planetarium show.

00:32.158 --> 00:35.161
Yeah. It's on page three
of the Arts and Leisure section.

00:43.086 --> 00:45.422
Oh, look, they still have <i>Far Side.</i>

00:46.089 --> 00:47.298
I don't get that one.

00:47.549 --> 00:50.218
Oh. He's pushing
when he should be pulling.

00:51.052 --> 00:53.680
I don't think he belongs
in that gifted school, then.

00:54.764 --> 00:56.850
- What are you doing?
- Making a boat.

00:56.933 --> 00:58.727
When I was a kid,
my dad showed me how.

00:58.810 --> 01:01.229
Boy, you'll do anything
to avoid reading.

01:02.355 --> 01:04.858
Guys, it's under
"Things to do this weekend."

01:04.983 --> 01:06.735
I can't find it.
What does it say?

01:06.818 --> 01:09.487
That it's a thing
to do this weekend.

01:10.238 --> 01:12.282
Well, that's great, Raj.
Congratulations.

01:12.490 --> 01:15.577
You know, while we're bragging,
<i>The Journal of Prosthetic Medicine</i>

01:15.744 --> 01:18.329
just wrote up the project that
Howard and I are working on.

01:18.538 --> 01:19.914
Well, you didn't tell me that.

01:20.123 --> 01:22.125
Oh, it just came out.
It's just a little blurb.

01:22.417 --> 01:24.127
Oh. Well, good for you.

01:24.210 --> 01:26.379
You know, Bert and I have
started isolating zircons

01:26.463 --> 01:27.964
from meteorites
for our dark matter search.

01:29.132 --> 01:30.133
Oh! Well, how nice.

01:30.216 --> 01:31.926
Everyone's doing impressive work.

01:32.177 --> 01:33.386
What have you been
working on these days?

01:33.470 --> 01:35.305
Ooh, where'd that come from?

01:36.514 --> 01:38.016
Where did what come from?

01:38.099 --> 01:39.350
I try to be supportive,

01:39.434 --> 01:42.103
and you break out the hot lights
and the rubber hose.

01:43.062 --> 01:44.189
I just asked
what you've been working on.

01:44.272 --> 01:46.483
Oh, my God, let it go.

01:46.983 --> 01:48.318
Can you believe this guy?

01:48.526 --> 01:49.861
I did it!

01:52.989 --> 01:55.283
See? It's a boat.

01:56.868 --> 01:59.204
It's also a hat.

02:28.775 --> 02:30.443
Okay, how do you want
to play this?

02:30.568 --> 02:32.278
Do you want to pretend like
nothing's bothering you

02:32.362 --> 02:34.113
and blow up later,
or do you just want to be

02:34.197 --> 02:35.949
a maniac right now?

02:37.158 --> 02:38.993
Nothing is bothering me.

02:39.828 --> 02:41.579
Fine. Be that way.

02:41.663 --> 02:45.041
If you want to talk,
I'll be flushing my sinuses.

02:46.167 --> 02:47.460
Wait.

02:47.794 --> 02:49.295
I have a confession.

02:49.629 --> 02:52.006
When I berated Leonard,

02:52.090 --> 02:54.884
it was a clever ruse
to conceal the fact

02:54.968 --> 02:57.011
that I'm not
working on anything.

02:57.554 --> 02:59.472
Well, I think I speak for everyone

02:59.556 --> 03:01.432
when I say, "No!"

03:03.226 --> 03:06.688
The truth is I have
nothing of interest to pursue.

03:07.063 --> 03:09.148
Well, maybe this is
the perfect opportunity

03:09.232 --> 03:11.901
to take some time
for yourself and refocus.

03:12.026 --> 03:14.696
I'm sure you'll find something
you're excited about.

03:15.321 --> 03:16.781
Thank you, Amy.

03:17.073 --> 03:18.867
I don't know what I'd do
without you.

03:20.118 --> 03:22.537
Hey, can I stay here?
Sheldon kicked me out.

03:23.788 --> 03:25.081
Well, is everything okay?

03:25.164 --> 03:27.584
Yeah. He just wants
some alone time to work.

03:27.667 --> 03:28.668
Fine. Make yourself at home.

03:28.751 --> 03:30.295
Yeah. We were just about
to watch a little TV.

03:30.378 --> 03:32.463
- You're welcome to join us.
- Thanks. I'll be right with you.

03:32.547 --> 03:35.049
I just have to do my neti pot.

03:45.393 --> 03:47.061
So what are you guys gonna watch?

03:50.273 --> 03:52.108
Okay.

03:52.191 --> 03:54.152
Hey, what do you think
we should open our show with?

03:54.402 --> 03:58.114
<i>Thor and Doctor Jones</i>
or <i>Let's Get Astrophysical?</i>

03:59.574 --> 04:00.783
I think we should
start with something

04:00.867 --> 04:02.535
that gets them up on their feet.

04:02.744 --> 04:05.079
Maybe <i>Sherlock Around the Clock.</i>

04:05.705 --> 04:07.916
Great, yeah.
Let's give it a try.

04:10.793 --> 04:13.087
<i>Halley's napping! Keep it down!</i>

04:13.755 --> 04:15.506
Right. Sorry.

04:15.715 --> 04:18.259
It's cool.
We don't need volume to rock.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.136
Instead of blowing
the roof off this place,

04:20.219 --> 04:21.804
we can gently lift it off

04:21.930 --> 04:24.641
and set it quietly down
in the backyard.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.561
Okay. One, two, three, four.

04:30.521 --> 04:32.315
<i>Holmes said to Watson</i>

04:32.440 --> 04:33.983
<i>On Baker Street</i>

04:34.067 --> 04:35.818
<i>Come on Doctor</i>

04:35.902 --> 04:37.362
<i>Time to move them feet</i>

04:37.487 --> 04:39.280
Sing it with us!

04:39.364 --> 04:41.282
<i>Sherlock Sherlock</i>

04:41.366 --> 04:43.117
<i>Sherlock around the clock</i>

04:43.534 --> 04:44.744
We can't hear you.

04:44.827 --> 04:46.579
<i>Sherlock Sherlock</i>

04:46.663 --> 04:48.539
<i>Sherlock around the clock</i>

04:51.250 --> 04:52.543
<i>Nice going.</i>

04:52.794 --> 04:54.253
Sorry. Sorry. I'll get her.

04:55.546 --> 04:56.839
One sec.

04:58.257 --> 04:59.801
<i>You bought diapers, right?</i>

05:02.011 --> 05:03.596
Be right back.

05:04.347 --> 05:06.182
Rock and roll!

05:09.602 --> 05:12.647
Okay. Scratch paper, check.

05:12.730 --> 05:14.107
Whiteboard, check.

05:14.232 --> 05:16.567
Chex Mix, check.

05:17.527 --> 05:19.278
And here we go.

05:21.906 --> 05:23.324
Dang it.

05:25.243 --> 05:26.452
Hello, Mother.

05:26.619 --> 05:28.246
Hi there, Shelly.
You will never believe

05:28.329 --> 05:31.082
who I ran into
at the barbecue festival.

05:31.332 --> 05:33.835
I am right in the middle
of some very important work.

05:33.918 --> 05:35.670
I don't have time for this
right now.

05:36.129 --> 05:38.339
Then why did you
answer the phone?

05:38.631 --> 05:39.882
Because you raised me
to be polite.

05:39.966 --> 05:41.551
Now stop bothering me.

06:11.622 --> 06:13.291
Hello again.

06:14.417 --> 06:16.461
Who did you see
at the barbecue festival?

06:17.086 --> 06:18.421
Mr. Watkins.

06:18.796 --> 06:20.089
Yeah. Really?

06:20.173 --> 06:22.508
You called me and interrupted
my work to tell me

06:22.592 --> 06:25.094
that you ran into somebody
you could plausibly run into?

06:25.178 --> 06:27.680
I'm sorry, Mother,
I really need to focus here.

06:27.764 --> 06:29.057
I will speak to you next week.

06:29.140 --> 06:31.225
Okay, sweetheart.
I'll talk to you then.

06:41.319 --> 06:43.696
I thought Mr. Watkins
moved to Florida.

06:44.322 --> 06:47.450
He did.
He was back visiting his son.

06:47.533 --> 06:49.702
Oh, gosh darn it,
that is interesting.

06:50.703 --> 06:51.829
Was it Tommy or Joe?

06:51.913 --> 06:53.581
I bet it was Joe, 'cause
he and Tommy had a falling out

06:53.664 --> 06:55.374
over that time-share.

06:57.877 --> 06:59.629
You guys do anything fun after dinner?

06:59.754 --> 07:02.173
Well, actually Amy came
back over and we hung out.

07:02.298 --> 07:04.425
Did you know that we're both
spelling bee champs?

07:04.509 --> 07:07.178
We stayed up for hours
trying to stump each other.

07:08.387 --> 07:09.597
Who won?

07:10.181 --> 07:12.350
She thought she had me
with "appoggiatura,"

07:12.433 --> 07:15.353
but I shut that down expeditiously.

07:15.561 --> 07:19.107
E-X-P-E-D-I-T-I-O-U-S-L-Y.
Expeditiously.

07:21.025 --> 07:24.362
Wow. I bet that made Penny
take off all of her clothes.

07:25.822 --> 07:28.407
Put her pajamas on and
then go to bed early.

07:29.325 --> 07:31.577
- Yeah, at like, 9:00.
- Yeah.

07:31.911 --> 07:33.204
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.498
Oh, are we still on
for band practice this evening?

07:35.581 --> 07:36.791
Oh, shoot.

07:36.874 --> 07:40.211
I promised I would take Halley
over to Bernadette's parents.

07:40.336 --> 07:42.130
Dude, the gig is,
like, next weekend.

07:42.213 --> 07:44.757
I know. I'm sorry.
I really want to do this,

07:44.841 --> 07:47.260
but I just don't think
I have the time.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.929
Okay. I guess I'll have to cancel.

07:50.054 --> 07:52.557
Toby Greenbaum will have to
become a man without us.

07:53.808 --> 07:55.810
Too bad, you guys kill at bar mitzvahs.

07:55.893 --> 07:58.187
And other events that
people can't leave.

08:00.356 --> 08:03.317
I don't want to be the one
who breaks up the band.

08:03.651 --> 08:05.903
You know, maybe you should

08:06.112 --> 08:07.655
think about replacing me.

08:07.780 --> 08:09.448
- Okay.
<i>- I mean...</i>

08:10.616 --> 08:12.243
I know it'll be hard since we...

08:12.326 --> 08:15.037
I bet Bert could do it.
He plays guitar.

08:15.121 --> 08:16.664
I'm gonna go ask him.

08:18.833 --> 08:21.294
I guess he forgot that
I play the cello.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.006
I don't think he did.

08:28.009 --> 08:29.635
Okay, I think it's ready.

08:29.802 --> 08:31.179
Should we put on safety goggles?

08:31.262 --> 08:33.764
Well, the funnest fun
is the safest fun, so yes.

08:34.765 --> 08:35.808
Hey.

08:35.892 --> 08:36.934
- Hi.
- Hello.

08:37.018 --> 08:39.395
Amy, you're here, again.

08:40.146 --> 08:42.064
Yeah, Sheldon said he needed
another night to work,

08:42.148 --> 08:43.858
so I said I'd give him some space.

08:44.025 --> 08:45.067
So what's all this?

08:45.151 --> 08:47.737
Well, Amy and I were talking
about old science fair projects

08:47.820 --> 08:49.363
and how fun it would be
to recreate them.

08:49.447 --> 08:50.990
We're making hot ice.

08:51.157 --> 08:52.325
It's pretty cool.

08:52.617 --> 08:54.452
- Nice one.
- Yeah.

08:54.994 --> 08:56.078
Turns out we both

08:56.162 --> 08:58.539
did this as our science fair
projects in ninth grade.

08:58.748 --> 09:00.541
Do you remember any of
your high school projects?

09:00.625 --> 09:04.295
Uh... Well,
I remember telling Jenny Runyon

09:04.378 --> 09:06.339
that I would teach her
how to flirt with boys

09:06.422 --> 09:08.090
if she put my name on her project.

09:08.299 --> 09:10.218
I got an "A," she got pregnant.

09:12.220 --> 09:14.931
Girls like you are why I had to
come straight home after school.

09:16.974 --> 09:18.392
Check this out.

09:20.061 --> 09:21.270
<i>Look at that.</i>

09:21.812 --> 09:23.481
<i>Wow, that's amazing.</i>

09:23.564 --> 09:26.484
<i>Mmm-hmm. The crystallization is
an exothermic process,</i>

09:26.567 --> 09:27.902
<i>so the ice is actually hot.</i>

09:28.027 --> 09:30.071
- I won first place for this.
- So did I.

09:30.154 --> 09:31.989
I threw Jenny's baby shower.

09:33.241 --> 09:34.492
Oh. Hey, in seventh grade,

09:34.575 --> 09:36.369
I built a cobra wave.
You want to do that?

09:36.661 --> 09:38.663
Oh. We can come up with
a wave speed formula,

09:38.746 --> 09:40.957
and see how accurately
we can predict the amplitude.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.458
Wow, I didn't think
anything could top

09:42.541 --> 09:45.086
last night's spelling bee,
but here comes math.

09:46.462 --> 09:48.589
I'm sorry, we don't
have to do more experiments.

09:48.673 --> 09:50.508
Let's do something we can all enjoy.

09:50.925 --> 09:52.843
Hey, you want to watch
that show you like

09:52.927 --> 09:55.596
where people want to buy a house
and then they do?

09:56.722 --> 09:59.308
No, no, you guys do your experiments.
I'll go pick up dinner.

09:59.392 --> 10:01.310
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, you're having science fun,

10:01.394 --> 10:03.980
and I don't want to interfere,
or watch you.

10:12.822 --> 10:14.407
Did I actually do it?

10:14.949 --> 10:18.327
I did. I did.

10:22.206 --> 10:24.500
The answer is one in 18 million.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.085
What is?

10:26.877 --> 10:29.755
The odds of you
running into Mr. Watkins.

10:30.131 --> 10:32.258
Oh, Shelly. I have bad news.

10:32.341 --> 10:34.427
Mr. Watkins passed this morning.

10:35.261 --> 10:37.096
Oh!

10:37.221 --> 10:38.597
I'm sorry.

10:38.681 --> 10:41.017
I know. What are the odds of that?

10:42.518 --> 10:43.769
Call you back.

10:50.860 --> 10:52.570
<i>Now, let's calculate the amplitude!</i>

10:52.653 --> 10:54.071
<i>All right!</i>

11:00.619 --> 11:03.456
Sheldon? Sheldon? Sheldon?

11:06.917 --> 11:08.919
It's annoying when you do it.

11:09.879 --> 11:10.963
I brought pizza.

11:11.047 --> 11:12.840
Oh, thank you.

11:13.007 --> 11:14.467
I have been working pretty hard.

11:14.550 --> 11:15.801
I could use a break.

11:16.385 --> 11:17.511
What's that?

11:17.845 --> 11:19.597
Yeah, that is an experiment

11:19.680 --> 11:22.266
to see how many parallelograms
I could draw

11:22.350 --> 11:24.226
while holding my breath.

11:25.519 --> 11:28.022
Is that where you blacked out?

11:28.647 --> 11:29.982
No, actually,

11:30.066 --> 11:31.984
that's where I blacked out.

11:33.569 --> 11:34.570
And this?

11:34.653 --> 11:35.821
That is a list

11:35.905 --> 11:38.741
of all the different types
of natural disasters.

11:39.075 --> 11:40.159
"Fire-quake"?

11:41.577 --> 11:42.912
I made that one up.

11:43.913 --> 11:46.332
Which I shouldn't have,
because now I'm scared of it.

11:47.041 --> 11:49.502
Hey, I thought you were
working on actual science.

11:49.627 --> 11:50.628
I am.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.797
I'm trying to come up with
a new approach to dark matter,

11:52.880 --> 11:54.715
but people keep distracting me.

11:54.799 --> 11:57.176
First, my mother kept answering
the phone when I called,

11:57.259 --> 11:58.844
even though she knew
I was busy.

11:59.345 --> 12:01.764
And now you show up
with my favorite shape of food.

12:01.847 --> 12:04.392
A circle made of triangles
served in a square box.

12:06.143 --> 12:07.770
Maybe I'll just eat this
in the laundry room.

12:07.853 --> 12:09.105
No, no. Wait.

12:09.188 --> 12:13.067
You don't have to go, as long as you
sit quietly and don't say anything.

12:13.275 --> 12:14.735
Fine.

12:20.825 --> 12:21.826
Mmm.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.702
Good.

12:27.998 --> 12:29.667
Are you mocking me?

12:35.089 --> 12:37.925
Hey, you want to hear
one of my geology songs?

12:38.843 --> 12:40.219
So it's about rocks?

12:40.302 --> 12:42.388
Better. It's about a boulder.

12:43.305 --> 12:44.723
Isn't that the same thing?

12:44.974 --> 12:46.142
Far from it.

12:46.267 --> 12:50.104
A boulder has a diameter
greater than 25.6 centimeters.

12:50.229 --> 12:52.231
Is that fact in the song?

12:52.523 --> 12:53.649
No.

12:54.442 --> 12:55.818
Yes.

12:57.528 --> 12:59.405
It's sung from the viewpoint
of the boulder

12:59.488 --> 13:01.323
that chases Indiana Jones.

13:01.407 --> 13:03.909
That's right up our alley.
Let's hear it.

13:04.201 --> 13:05.202
Okay.

13:07.288 --> 13:11.542
<i>Alone in my temple
in the middle of Peru</i>

13:11.876 --> 13:15.337
<i>A giant stone ball
with nothing much to do</i>

13:15.421 --> 13:18.466
<i>But if you steal my idol</i>

13:18.924 --> 13:21.802
<i>I will roll right over you</i>

13:22.678 --> 13:27.016
<i>'Cause I'm six tons of
granite and Micaceous Schist</i>

13:27.141 --> 13:30.102
<i>Yeah I'm six tons of granite and</i>

13:30.311 --> 13:31.645
<i>Micaceous Schist</i>

13:31.729 --> 13:35.983
<i>Yeah, I'm six tons of granite
and Micaceous Schist</i>

13:36.108 --> 13:38.402
<i>Yeah I'm six tons of granite and</i>

13:38.486 --> 13:40.654
<i>Micaceous Schist</i>

13:42.698 --> 13:43.991
So, I think if we want

13:44.074 --> 13:46.368
to predict the height
of the wave, we need to use

13:46.452 --> 13:48.871
elasticity theory and model the lattice

13:48.996 --> 13:51.373
as one continuous flexible piece.

13:51.624 --> 13:52.917
This is fun.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.543
Playing with Popsicle sticks,

13:54.627 --> 13:56.879
exploring ways
to store kinetic energy.

13:56.962 --> 13:59.048
It's like preschool all over again.

14:00.049 --> 14:02.051
Except now if I eat paste,
it's because I want to,

14:02.134 --> 14:04.303
not because
Craig Schultz is making me.

14:06.263 --> 14:07.640
Hey, can I ask you a question?

14:07.723 --> 14:08.807
Is it, "Where was the teacher?"

14:08.891 --> 14:11.101
She was in the bathroom smoking,
that's where.

14:12.436 --> 14:15.356
It wasn't, but I'm glad
to see you've moved on.

14:16.565 --> 14:19.401
I was gonna ask if being married
felt any different.

14:19.818 --> 14:20.819
Oh.

14:22.238 --> 14:23.531
Not really.

14:23.614 --> 14:25.950
Sorry. That probably wasn't
the answer you were looking for.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.993
No, actually it is.

14:28.077 --> 14:30.704
I mean, Sheldon and I are in
a really great place right now,

14:30.871 --> 14:33.374
and I just, I don't want
anything to mess that up.

14:33.541 --> 14:35.376
Mmm-hmm. You do remember you're here

14:35.459 --> 14:37.670
because he kicked you
out of your apartment?

14:38.754 --> 14:39.880
Yes.

14:40.005 --> 14:41.966
His work is important to him.

14:42.383 --> 14:45.719
It's one of the things I find
the sexiest about him.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.138
Well, that and...

14:53.894 --> 14:55.312
His butt.

14:58.107 --> 14:59.441
And then, I was thinking about

14:59.525 --> 15:01.402
inventing a new
dark matter particle

15:01.485 --> 15:03.404
to evade the omega
baryon constraints,

15:03.487 --> 15:04.863
but that just seems like something

15:04.947 --> 15:06.407
anyone could come up with.

15:06.490 --> 15:09.577
Hmm. Agreed.

15:10.286 --> 15:12.121
You know what's blowing my mind?

15:12.413 --> 15:16.208
Somebody thought about
putting cheese in this crust.

15:18.127 --> 15:21.088
I just wish I could find
something that excites me.

15:21.297 --> 15:23.757
You do understand that
crust doesn't normally

15:23.841 --> 15:25.718
come with cheese in it?

15:26.635 --> 15:27.845
Okay, all right, look.

15:27.970 --> 15:30.889
What got you excited about
dark matter in the first place?

15:31.515 --> 15:34.101
Well, I left string theory,

15:34.184 --> 15:35.644
which I'd been working
on for a long time,

15:35.728 --> 15:38.856
and everyone was talking about
how cool dark matter was,

15:38.939 --> 15:41.692
and I thought, "Well, sure,
I'll give that a whirl."

15:41.984 --> 15:44.069
So it's your rebound science?

15:46.488 --> 15:47.573
What's that?

15:47.656 --> 15:49.700
Well, not the science you spend
the rest of your life with,

15:49.783 --> 15:52.202
but the one you use to make
yourself feel pretty again.

15:55.623 --> 15:57.124
Well, if I'm being honest,

15:57.207 --> 15:59.084
I never forgot about string theory.

15:59.251 --> 16:00.461
I mean, it's remarkable.

16:00.544 --> 16:03.339
It's the closest we've come
to a theory of everything,

16:03.422 --> 16:05.966
something even Einstein
couldn't figure out.

16:06.634 --> 16:09.345
Well, if he couldn't figure
it out, maybe it's just wrong.

16:10.596 --> 16:11.930
But it's so elegant.

16:12.014 --> 16:15.017
I mean, look, string theory posits

16:15.184 --> 16:18.062
that the fundamental particles
we see in three dimensions

16:18.270 --> 16:23.275
are actually strings embedded
in multidimensional space-time.

16:24.276 --> 16:26.320
Interesting.

16:27.613 --> 16:29.615
So that would mean,

16:30.282 --> 16:31.700
that...

16:33.327 --> 16:35.120
Can't do this by myself, buddy.

16:45.798 --> 16:47.716
What is happening?

16:49.510 --> 16:50.886
I was trying not to wake you.

16:51.053 --> 16:52.596
Did it work?

16:53.681 --> 16:54.723
Sorry.

16:54.807 --> 16:56.558
I just realized,

16:56.767 --> 17:00.729
now that I'm not in the band,
I can focus on my own music.

17:00.938 --> 17:03.148
You know? Go solo.

17:05.234 --> 17:06.652
You said you were
taking a break from the band

17:06.735 --> 17:08.278
to help with me and the baby.

17:08.821 --> 17:12.032
Yes, and write an astronaut musical.

17:12.533 --> 17:14.326
Picture this.
The curtain opens.

17:14.493 --> 17:17.913
There's a lone astronaut floating
in the inky blackness of space.

17:17.996 --> 17:20.249
Maybe wires,
maybe fog.

17:20.332 --> 17:22.501
I'll let the director figure that out.

17:23.669 --> 17:26.797
<i>I really don't know when</i>

17:27.005 --> 17:32.386
<i>I'll run out of oxygen</i>

17:34.513 --> 17:36.932
Good news! I'm back in the band!

17:37.558 --> 17:39.309
So Bernadette doesn't mind?

17:39.393 --> 17:41.311
It was her idea!

17:44.690 --> 17:46.608
So it's sort of like a guitar string,

17:46.692 --> 17:48.652
but instead of making an actual sound,

17:48.736 --> 17:50.946
each vibration is a different particle.

17:51.155 --> 17:54.491
Precisely. And when
you express it in 11 dimensions,

17:54.575 --> 17:56.744
Einstein's relativity equations pop out.

17:56.827 --> 17:57.953
Does that sound like a coincidence?

17:58.036 --> 17:59.830
- It does not.
- Yep.

18:00.497 --> 18:02.207
That's what I think.

18:02.666 --> 18:05.377
So, did we do it?
Did we just solve string theory?

18:05.627 --> 18:06.628
Oh!

18:06.795 --> 18:09.131
I appreciate your enthusiasm,

18:09.214 --> 18:10.674
but this is not the sort of thing

18:10.758 --> 18:11.925
we can figure out in a night.

18:12.009 --> 18:14.011
People have been
stuck on this for decades.

18:14.094 --> 18:15.721
What, decades? Really?

18:15.804 --> 18:18.891
It's a string.
How hard can it be?

18:19.016 --> 18:20.768
It's straight, it's in a loop,

18:20.851 --> 18:23.020
it gets knotted up
with other strings.

18:23.187 --> 18:25.022
Well, actually there are no knots

18:25.105 --> 18:26.982
in anything greater
than four dimensions.

18:27.483 --> 18:29.276
Unless

18:29.568 --> 18:33.322
we get around that
by considering them as sheets.

18:33.614 --> 18:35.240
You know, topologically speaking,

18:35.324 --> 18:38.410
that has
a lot of interesting possibilities.

18:38.744 --> 18:41.163
See? How long did that take me,
like a minute?

18:47.044 --> 18:48.337
Thought you were getting us dinner.

18:48.420 --> 18:49.922
Sorry.
I had to stop at Sheldon's

18:50.005 --> 18:52.341
and help him solve string theory.

18:56.887 --> 18:58.305
What?

18:59.223 --> 19:01.642
Yeah, turns out the answer's knots.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.685
That's cute,
but you can't have knots

19:03.769 --> 19:05.145
in more than four dimensions.

19:05.229 --> 19:08.482
Mmm. You can
if you consider them sheets.

19:08.565 --> 19:10.150
Good night.
