00:03.630 --> 00:06.174
<i>Space is the mirror of the soul.</i>

00:06.257 --> 00:10.178
<i>Are we looking beyond,
or are we looking within?</i>

00:10.512 --> 00:12.389
I'm looking at my shoes.

00:12.472 --> 00:14.516
This is making me a
little motion sick.

00:15.934 --> 00:18.520
<i>When we gaze out
at the immensities of space,</i>

00:18.603 --> 00:20.897
<i>we understand them
because there are immensities</i>

00:20.980 --> 00:22.982
<i>within us as well.</i>

00:23.191 --> 00:24.859
<i>I'm Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali,</i>

00:24.943 --> 00:27.779
<i>and thank you
for taking a walk with me</i>

00:28.988 --> 00:30.657
<i>through the stars.</i>

00:33.827 --> 00:36.162
That pause gets
longer every show.

00:36.246 --> 00:37.831
I believe

00:38.289 --> 00:39.791
you're right.

00:40.583 --> 00:42.419
Hey. Can I get a picture with you?

00:42.544 --> 00:43.795
Absolutely.

00:44.170 --> 00:45.547
And if you post it on social media,

00:45.630 --> 00:47.757
I suggest the hashtag "Koothra-poet."

00:48.925 --> 00:50.301
Thank you.
The show was great.

00:50.385 --> 00:51.636
Well, I can't take all the credit.

00:51.720 --> 00:53.555
I have pretty good co-stars.

00:53.888 --> 00:55.932
The stars.

00:58.560 --> 00:59.686
Do you say that to everyone?

00:59.894 --> 01:01.271
Only to beautiful women.

01:01.438 --> 01:03.356
And okay women.

01:04.107 --> 01:05.233
Okay.

01:05.316 --> 01:07.360
Just to clarify,
you're the first kind.

01:07.610 --> 01:09.237
Okay.

01:09.362 --> 01:10.947
Mmm.

01:11.114 --> 01:14.367
Thanks for coming. What did you handsome
gentlemen think of the show?

01:14.534 --> 01:15.952
You can turn it off now.

01:16.202 --> 01:19.456
It's sweet of you to say,
but I don't think I can.

01:48.318 --> 01:50.737
Look at this cute picture
of Halley in the bath.

01:50.820 --> 01:52.363
That's great.

01:52.447 --> 01:53.490
Want me to send it to you?

01:53.573 --> 01:56.367
No, on your phone it's cute,
on my phone it's a crime.

01:58.077 --> 02:01.039
I also have
a pretty cute picture to share.

02:02.457 --> 02:03.750
What is that?

02:03.875 --> 02:05.794
An equation.

02:06.252 --> 02:07.378
Isn't it perfect?

02:07.712 --> 02:08.880
Sometimes I just stare at it,

02:08.963 --> 02:11.257
and I think, "I can't believe
that came out of me."

02:12.050 --> 02:13.843
Well, since we're sharing pictures,

02:13.927 --> 02:15.470
I have one to contribute.

02:15.595 --> 02:18.556
Please don't let it be
you and your dog in the bathtub.

02:18.932 --> 02:20.058
It's not.

02:20.642 --> 02:22.101
But don't swipe.

02:24.646 --> 02:25.939
What are we looking at here?

02:26.022 --> 02:28.525
Well, that's me and a beautiful woman

02:28.608 --> 02:31.903
and my watch showing the time
as 2:30 in the morning.

02:33.696 --> 02:36.032
So, state's exhibit "A"?

02:36.950 --> 02:39.536
No. I met her at
the planetarium a few days ago,

02:39.619 --> 02:41.871
and she invited me out for a drink.

02:41.955 --> 02:44.833
Oh. Good for you.
And what's the Hindi word for "dog"?

02:44.916 --> 02:46.793
- A <i>kutta.</i>
- You <i>kutta.</i>

02:47.961 --> 02:49.045
<i>Bow-bow.</i>

02:50.171 --> 02:52.090
That's Hindi for woof-woof.

02:53.174 --> 02:55.260
I am seeing her again tonight.

02:55.343 --> 02:57.470
You know, I also have a date tonight.

02:57.554 --> 02:59.430
But don't worry,
it's not another woman.

02:59.597 --> 03:01.474
It's string theory.

03:02.350 --> 03:04.102
<i>Bow-bow.</i>

03:06.521 --> 03:08.690
Sorry, he's a <i>kutta,</i> you're not.

03:13.528 --> 03:15.071
- Hi.
- Hello.

03:15.363 --> 03:16.364
What you doing?

03:16.489 --> 03:19.409
Taking another picture with my baby.

03:20.660 --> 03:22.328
Look how big he got.

03:23.955 --> 03:25.456
It's fun to see you this excited.

03:25.540 --> 03:26.958
Thank you, that's so...

03:27.125 --> 03:28.960
- Don't sit there!
- What, what?

03:29.043 --> 03:31.671
Sorry. It's part
of my organization system.

03:31.754 --> 03:33.590
That's where those papers go.

03:34.090 --> 03:37.427
Okay. How about if I just

03:37.719 --> 03:38.928
slide this notebook...

03:41.598 --> 03:43.182
You know what, it's fine.
I'll just be in the bedroom.

03:43.266 --> 03:45.894
No, no. This is your apartment, too.

03:46.019 --> 03:47.437
Look, I'll stop for the night

03:47.562 --> 03:48.813
and clean this up.

03:49.230 --> 03:51.065
Well, that's very considerate, Sheldon.

03:51.149 --> 03:52.525
I know.

03:52.984 --> 03:54.319
See, I'm trying this new technique

03:54.402 --> 03:57.447
where I imagine how I would feel
in someone else's position.

03:58.197 --> 03:59.532
You mean empathy?

03:59.616 --> 04:01.784
Aw, I thought I came up with it.

04:02.744 --> 04:05.204
Well, regardless,
I appreciate the effort.

04:05.288 --> 04:07.916
Thank you.
It's really hard.

04:11.294 --> 04:13.713
- Morning.
- Good morning.

04:14.547 --> 04:16.591
Aw, you didn't have
to cook me breakfast.

04:16.674 --> 04:18.468
Well, I wasn't sure
how I did last night,

04:18.551 --> 04:20.136
and I wanted to finish strong.

04:21.930 --> 04:23.097
You don't need to worry.

04:23.181 --> 04:24.182
Last night was great.

04:24.724 --> 04:26.976
Ah, well, you say that now,

04:27.143 --> 04:31.481
but wait until you taste this.

04:33.149 --> 04:34.943
Oh, my God, this is amazing.

04:35.234 --> 04:37.528
Which is why I keep an omelet
pan in the trunk of my car.

04:39.781 --> 04:41.950
Well, thank you,
it's delicious.

04:42.033 --> 04:44.077
My husband never cooked for me.

04:44.577 --> 04:46.829
Oh. You were married.

04:47.038 --> 04:50.458
Yeah. Well, technically,
I guess I still am.

04:51.793 --> 04:53.378
Is that "technically,"

04:53.461 --> 04:55.129
like, the paperwork hasn't gone through,

04:55.213 --> 04:57.465
or "technically,"

04:57.548 --> 05:00.301
like, he's in the closet
watching us right now?

05:01.928 --> 05:04.180
No, no, we're separated.

05:04.472 --> 05:05.890
Do you mind if we talk
about something else?

05:05.974 --> 05:07.141
Of course.

05:07.517 --> 05:10.395
You know, my secret to
making great omelets is that

05:10.478 --> 05:12.730
I beat the egg whites separately.

05:13.064 --> 05:15.233
Speaking of which,
how long have you been separated?

05:17.026 --> 05:18.403
About two weeks.

05:19.362 --> 05:21.447
That is not a lot of weeks.

05:22.198 --> 05:26.285
In fact, that's the bare minimum
to get to the plural "weeks."

05:28.454 --> 05:30.540
Doesn't matter.
He moved out, I moved on.

05:31.040 --> 05:32.041
Good.

05:32.125 --> 05:34.043
Yeah, do you mind me asking
what he does for a living?

05:34.127 --> 05:35.294
He's a firefighter.

05:36.129 --> 05:37.463
Interesting.

05:37.714 --> 05:40.633
A potentially jealous man
who's handy with an ax.

05:41.676 --> 05:43.469
It's okay, though.

05:43.553 --> 05:46.055
He's almost had two weeks to cool down.

05:48.850 --> 05:51.561
Okay, the next drug is Romatrol.

05:51.644 --> 05:53.646
Oh, I know this one. We're actually
pushing it really hard.

05:53.730 --> 05:55.523
It treats mild dermatitis.

05:55.606 --> 05:57.900
Correct. And who can it
be prescribed to?

05:57.984 --> 06:01.029
Adults and children
who have absolutely, for sure,

06:01.112 --> 06:02.697
stopped growing.

06:03.906 --> 06:06.325
Right again.
And what are the side effects?

06:06.492 --> 06:08.077
Oh. Shoot, shoot.

06:08.161 --> 06:09.412
Remember the mnemonic.

06:09.912 --> 06:11.789
Gravy. Yes. G-R-A-V-Y.

06:11.873 --> 06:15.251
Okay, gastric distress,
redness, anal leakage,

06:15.334 --> 06:18.963
vasculitis and yellow eyes.

06:20.006 --> 06:21.007
So close.

06:21.090 --> 06:23.718
- It's actually yellow discharge.
- Oh. Right.

06:24.343 --> 06:26.637
That's why we went with "gravy."

06:28.389 --> 06:29.474
Hello.

06:29.557 --> 06:30.767
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:37.190 --> 06:39.358
He knows he doesn't
live here anymore, right?

06:39.567 --> 06:43.196
Maybe he's experiencing
memory loss because he took...

06:43.446 --> 06:45.490
- Flaxitrite.
- Yeah.

06:45.948 --> 06:48.326
- Thank you.
- Sheldon, what are you doing?

06:48.534 --> 06:50.620
Oh, I was just checking in
on my old room

06:50.703 --> 06:52.121
to see what you've done with it.

06:52.413 --> 06:53.581
Why?

06:53.664 --> 06:56.626
Well, I could use a place
to work in the evenings...

06:56.709 --> 06:58.461
- No.
- Well, it's just that

06:58.544 --> 06:59.587
there's not a lot of space in our

06:59.670 --> 07:00.755
- apartment...
- No.

07:00.838 --> 07:01.839
Well, and I feel like

07:01.923 --> 07:03.007
- Amy's been having...
- No.

07:03.341 --> 07:05.510
- And since you're not...
- No.

07:06.385 --> 07:08.012
- It's...
- No.

07:09.847 --> 07:11.140
No.

07:12.475 --> 07:15.144
That is our room now,
and we're gonna turn it into a gym.

07:15.228 --> 07:17.063
Do you really expect me
to believe that?

07:18.147 --> 07:19.899
- No.
- No.

07:21.776 --> 07:23.027
So I guess what's bugging me

07:23.111 --> 07:24.946
is that they only broke up
13 days ago,

07:25.029 --> 07:26.197
and now I'm dating her.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.074
So, am I, like,
the good guy in my movie,

07:28.157 --> 07:29.575
or the bad guy in their movie?

07:29.826 --> 07:32.620
Pretty sure you're
the weird friend in our movie.

07:32.954 --> 07:35.081
I like her, okay?

07:35.164 --> 07:38.376
I just, I don't know how I feel about
being the third wheel in a relationship.

07:38.459 --> 07:41.087
Says the guy in my bed with my wife.

07:42.004 --> 07:44.590
Guys, I mean, he's around, okay?

07:44.674 --> 07:46.509
He's apparently not happy
about the breakup,

07:46.592 --> 07:48.469
and based on the sweatpants
he left at her place,

07:48.553 --> 07:50.721
he's like, a medium to large man.

07:52.098 --> 07:54.308
Maybe those are
his "after the holiday" pants,

07:54.392 --> 07:55.893
like you have.

07:56.686 --> 07:59.564
I don't know. I mean, do you think
it's too soon for her to be dating?

07:59.647 --> 08:00.982
If you and Bernadette broke up,

08:01.065 --> 08:02.400
like, how long would you wait?

08:02.483 --> 08:04.986
- Well, I don't even want to think...
- Eight days.

08:06.404 --> 08:07.405
What?

08:07.488 --> 08:10.158
Two days to cry.
Six days to hit the gym.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.952
First of all, you already look amazing.

08:13.035 --> 08:14.537
Aw, that's sweet.

08:14.996 --> 08:17.039
I'm gonna give him
an extra day of crying.

08:20.084 --> 08:21.961
The answer is still no.

08:24.839 --> 08:28.634
You can say we wouldn't know
you're here, but we'd know.

08:30.303 --> 08:32.138
Because you'd be here!

08:33.723 --> 08:36.350
So, who was that?

08:37.476 --> 08:39.187
I can't believe you hung up on me!

08:42.023 --> 08:44.567
What the hell?
What are you doing here?

08:44.817 --> 08:46.152
I am proving you wrong.

08:46.235 --> 08:47.695
I've been working
back there for hours.

08:47.778 --> 08:49.280
You had no idea.

08:49.572 --> 08:51.240
Do something.

08:51.324 --> 08:54.076
What the hell?
What are you doing here?

08:54.535 --> 08:56.704
I am trying to respect Amy.

08:56.787 --> 08:59.081
Okay, look, you have an office at work.
Why don't you go there?

08:59.165 --> 09:01.709
I can't go to the office
every time I have a brilliant thought.

09:01.792 --> 09:02.960
I'd basically be living there.

09:03.044 --> 09:04.921
Sounds good, do that.

09:05.213 --> 09:07.381
No. No, the campus
isn't safe at night.

09:07.465 --> 09:09.717
There's raccoons and
undergrads just walking around

09:09.800 --> 09:11.302
like they own the place.

09:11.969 --> 09:14.597
Look. I need somewhere
to work in the evenings.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.224
You have a space you aren't using.

09:16.307 --> 09:19.268
Just take a look at my proposal.

09:20.603 --> 09:22.605
- What is this?
- A rental agreement.

09:22.688 --> 09:24.482
I will only use the room for work.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.359
I won't sleep here,
I won't eat your food,

09:26.442 --> 09:27.777
I won't even use your bathroom.

09:27.860 --> 09:30.655
So you can just walk in any
time of the day or night?

09:30.738 --> 09:31.906
Well, he does that now.

09:31.989 --> 09:33.950
At least this way we'll get paid.

09:36.452 --> 09:38.537
<i>I am Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali,</i>

09:38.621 --> 09:41.457
<i>and thank you
for taking a walk with me</i>

09:44.919 --> 09:46.629
<i>through the stars.</i>

09:47.922 --> 09:50.675
I think that one was too long.

09:50.925 --> 09:52.718
Yeah, you're right.
I totally felt it.

09:52.802 --> 09:54.053
Should we run it again?

09:54.178 --> 09:56.097
Please, God, no.

09:57.515 --> 09:58.766
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:58.849 --> 10:00.017
Can I help you?

10:00.101 --> 10:02.561
Which one of you is Rajesh Koothrappali?

10:03.229 --> 10:04.272
Really? You're not sure

10:04.355 --> 10:06.816
which one of us is Rajesh Koothrappali?

10:08.359 --> 10:11.445
I am. I was just trying
not to be racist.

10:14.991 --> 10:16.784
I'm Nell's husband.

10:20.288 --> 10:23.332
Here's the thing, I didn't know

10:23.416 --> 10:25.376
that she was married until after...

10:25.459 --> 10:26.794
After what?

10:30.339 --> 10:33.175
I'm really sorry.

10:33.301 --> 10:35.136
Well, that doesn't make me feel better.

10:35.303 --> 10:36.762
What would make you feel better?

10:36.846 --> 10:38.306
I want you to stop seeing my wife.

10:38.389 --> 10:40.057
Done.
Nice to meet you. Bye.

10:41.976 --> 10:44.478
What am I gonna do?

10:50.568 --> 10:54.280
Hey, buddy, do you want to talk?

10:56.365 --> 10:58.409
I thought we were gonna start a family.

10:59.160 --> 11:01.287
Next thing I know, it's over.

11:03.289 --> 11:04.957
It's gonna be okay.

11:05.124 --> 11:06.292
How is it gonna be okay?

11:06.375 --> 11:08.711
You're sleeping with my wife.

11:10.338 --> 11:12.590
I mean, besides that.

11:21.766 --> 11:23.309
Can I get you anything?

11:23.392 --> 11:24.852
A glass of water?

11:25.061 --> 11:26.604
A laser show?

11:27.563 --> 11:28.773
- No, thank you.
- Good.

11:28.856 --> 11:31.275
'Cause I don't even know
how to turn it on.

11:32.276 --> 11:33.402
I'm sorry.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.363
I shouldn't have come here.

11:36.030 --> 11:38.699
I guess I just wanted to see
who she replaced me with.

11:39.408 --> 11:40.951
Don't say that.

11:41.035 --> 11:42.661
What you two had was special.

11:42.745 --> 11:44.413
No one can replace you.

11:44.622 --> 11:47.166
- Did she say that?
- No.

11:49.627 --> 11:50.961
- I should go, right?
- Stay.

11:51.045 --> 11:52.838
Okay, I'll call you later.

11:55.299 --> 11:58.803
Look, if it makes you feel any better,
I barely know her.

11:59.345 --> 12:01.680
And she had sex with you?

12:02.723 --> 12:05.726
Nell tells me you're a fireman.
What's that like?

12:14.443 --> 12:18.197
Okay, I'm really uncomfortable
with him back in that room.

12:18.364 --> 12:20.032
Why? He hasn't made a peep all day.

12:20.116 --> 12:22.952
You don't get it.
All the years that we lived together,

12:23.035 --> 12:25.037
he drove me crazy the whole time.

12:25.162 --> 12:27.331
And now he's not.

12:28.416 --> 12:29.959
Exactly.

12:31.043 --> 12:32.378
Don't look at me like that.

12:32.461 --> 12:35.047
It means he did it on purpose.

12:35.131 --> 12:36.507
It was a choice.

12:36.590 --> 12:39.552
That's like finding out
Godzilla could've had Arby's

12:39.635 --> 12:41.429
instead of Tokyo.

12:43.305 --> 12:44.723
I don't think they have Arby's in Japan.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.308
Not my point.

12:49.353 --> 12:51.188
Sheldon.

12:51.397 --> 12:52.731
Sheldon!

12:54.024 --> 12:56.485
I'm sorry. Am I being too loud?

12:57.570 --> 13:00.322
No, you're being perfect
and you know it.

13:00.406 --> 13:03.617
Would you like me to be a
less considerate tenant?

13:04.034 --> 13:06.078
No. Yes. What...

13:06.328 --> 13:08.289
Stop messing with me!

13:10.958 --> 13:14.420
Hey, I was wrong.
There's an Arby's in Okinawa.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.677
He was best friends
with her older brother,

13:21.760 --> 13:23.012
but he didn't even notice her.

13:23.095 --> 13:24.138
And then years afterward,

13:24.221 --> 13:26.724
they randomly bumped into
each other at the DMV.

13:26.932 --> 13:29.059
Two hours later,
they were in love.

13:29.477 --> 13:32.438
You can really see the sparkle
in his license photo.

13:34.190 --> 13:35.733
He told you all this at the planetarium?

13:35.816 --> 13:37.193
No, no, we went to House of Pies.

13:37.276 --> 13:38.819
He got banana cream.
I got coconut.

13:38.903 --> 13:40.488
We did halfsies.

13:41.197 --> 13:44.116
You did pie halfsies with another man?

13:44.533 --> 13:46.410
You mean other than you?

13:48.787 --> 13:50.164
Yeah.

13:51.499 --> 13:54.502
I feel bad for him, Bernie.
He's a good guy.

13:54.793 --> 13:57.379
Well, if you're uncomfortable with it,
maybe stop sleeping with his wife.

13:57.463 --> 13:58.839
I don't think the sex is the problem.

13:58.923 --> 14:01.342
I know for a fact I was just okay.

14:02.885 --> 14:05.846
For the record, I'm the one
who introduced you to House of Pies.

14:09.558 --> 14:11.644
Sheldon? Oh, Leonard.

14:12.728 --> 14:14.939
Sorry, I just, I had
to get out of there.

14:15.064 --> 14:16.190
What did he do now?

14:16.273 --> 14:18.567
Nothing. He's being a dream.

14:20.653 --> 14:23.572
Don't give me that look. That's how
Penny looked at me. I'm not crazy.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.658
Penny and I have the same
"You're crazy" look?

14:25.741 --> 14:27.159
That's kind of sweet.

14:28.494 --> 14:31.038
I know how to deal with
Sheldon being Sheldon,

14:31.121 --> 14:34.375
but Sheldon being a rational,
thoughtful person?

14:34.458 --> 14:36.001
I'm clueless.

14:36.085 --> 14:38.587
It's like when my mom called last year
to sing happy birthday

14:38.671 --> 14:41.298
and I just threw up.

14:42.341 --> 14:43.717
Well, if it gets to be too much,

14:43.801 --> 14:45.678
you can always send him back over here.

14:45.761 --> 14:46.845
I made a deal with him,

14:46.929 --> 14:48.556
and besides,
that wouldn't be fair to you.

14:49.181 --> 14:51.350
Well, actually, I miss him.
He's been over there a lot.

14:51.475 --> 14:53.852
Well, great.
Tell him he can come back.

14:53.936 --> 14:56.230
I can't. He's thinking of me
and my feelings

14:56.313 --> 14:57.690
and trying to be respectful.

14:57.773 --> 15:00.693
That's what he's doing
to me, too, the jerk!

15:01.694 --> 15:03.404
Stop that.

15:04.989 --> 15:08.075
Hey, your mad look and Sheldon's
constipated look are the same.

15:15.874 --> 15:18.127
- This is nice.
- It is.

15:20.462 --> 15:22.798
She used to kiss me like that.

15:24.258 --> 15:25.801
You okay?

15:26.677 --> 15:29.722
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.640
Yeah.

15:33.392 --> 15:35.394
Oh, God, I'm so alone.

15:35.519 --> 15:37.146
Sorry, I can't do this.

15:37.271 --> 15:39.106
What's going on?

15:39.773 --> 15:41.692
I met Oliver the other day.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.986
Wait, you tracked down my husband?

15:44.153 --> 15:45.654
No, that would be weird.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.449
He tracked me down,
then we spent the evening together.

15:49.783 --> 15:51.160
I don't believe this.

15:51.535 --> 15:54.371
He only did it
because he cares about you.

15:54.455 --> 15:57.541
No, he did it because
he's possessive and jealous.

15:57.625 --> 16:00.836
Really? I didn't get that at all.
He made me feel very comfortable.

16:01.879 --> 16:03.797
Well, I'm glad you two hit it off.

16:03.922 --> 16:07.051
You know, I don't think that
you're being very fair to him.

16:07.468 --> 16:08.969
You're taking his side?

16:09.053 --> 16:11.347
No, but I should point out
that he did offer

16:11.430 --> 16:14.016
to go to counseling,
so at least one of you is trying.

16:15.309 --> 16:16.852
You're crazier than he is.

16:16.935 --> 16:20.147
I'll tell you what,
just give him one more chance

16:20.230 --> 16:21.357
and if it doesn't work out,

16:21.482 --> 16:23.734
I'll be happy to keep
sleeping with you.

16:25.861 --> 16:27.655
You would?

16:28.530 --> 16:30.574
Either way, you've got yourself a fella.

16:30.658 --> 16:32.826
Like, how nice is that?

16:37.581 --> 16:39.083
Hey, Sheldon.

16:41.877 --> 16:43.212
- Hello.
- Hey.

16:43.295 --> 16:46.298
So, your contract provides
for a three-day trial period,

16:46.382 --> 16:48.801
and I don't think this is working out.

16:48.884 --> 16:50.427
So, to put it in legal terms,

16:50.552 --> 16:52.596
the party of the first part would like

16:52.680 --> 16:55.265
the party of the second part to get out.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.311
What time does the trial period end?

16:59.395 --> 17:00.562
12:00, noon.

17:00.646 --> 17:03.315
Yeah, what does it say after that?

17:07.236 --> 17:09.530
Eastern Standard Time.

17:10.781 --> 17:12.574
That was three hours ago.

17:12.991 --> 17:14.451
And since you didn't exercise

17:14.535 --> 17:18.747
your right to revoke,
I exercised my right to extend,

17:18.831 --> 17:23.293
triggering this long-form
rental agreement,

17:24.545 --> 17:26.964
of which you're already in violation.

17:27.339 --> 17:29.258
This is just a bunch of paper.

17:29.341 --> 17:30.884
You can't enforce this.

17:31.510 --> 17:33.262
Hire a lawyer.
Let's find out.

17:35.347 --> 17:36.724
This is not happening.

17:36.807 --> 17:37.850
Be that as it may,

17:37.933 --> 17:39.727
page nine says that
you have to provide me

17:39.810 --> 17:42.855
with lemon-flavored sparkling
water, so, chop-chop.

17:48.193 --> 17:49.278
Hey, how'd it go?

17:49.361 --> 17:51.572
Well, apparently he's not leaving,

17:51.655 --> 17:54.241
and I have to go get him
sparkling water.

17:55.617 --> 17:57.244
Why are you smiling?

17:57.369 --> 18:00.372
I don't know. It just feels right.

18:10.758 --> 18:12.551
<i>Through the stars.</i>

18:16.388 --> 18:17.556
Hey.

18:17.639 --> 18:19.683
Hey, buddy.

18:19.808 --> 18:20.934
I talked to Nell.

18:21.018 --> 18:22.936
She was pretty upset after you left.

18:23.020 --> 18:25.564
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- No. No, no, no.

18:25.647 --> 18:27.691
She told me that you said
something so creepy

18:27.775 --> 18:30.110
that I seemed great in comparison.

18:30.903 --> 18:32.821
I know exactly what it was.

18:32.905 --> 18:34.782
No, actually, there was
a couple of things it could've been.

18:34.865 --> 18:37.409
Whichever one it was,
it was creepy.

18:37.826 --> 18:39.912
Anyway, I went over to comfort her,

18:39.995 --> 18:43.582
and we talked, and I think we're
gonna give it another chance.

18:43.874 --> 18:46.960
I am so happy for you!

18:47.211 --> 18:49.338
Hey, we should celebrate.

18:49.421 --> 18:52.257
- House of Pies?
- You know it.

18:53.091 --> 18:54.092
Ah!

18:55.385 --> 18:56.512
Should we invite Nell?

18:56.595 --> 18:59.223
Do we have to? Nah.

19:25.958 --> 19:26.959
English - SDH
