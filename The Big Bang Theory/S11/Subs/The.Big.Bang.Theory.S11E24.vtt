WEBVTT

00:03.588 --> 00:05.423
All right, Saturday is the big day.

00:05.632 --> 00:07.342
A lot of people thought
this would never come.

00:07.467 --> 00:09.302
I may have been one of those people.

00:10.345 --> 00:11.763
I may have been one of those people.

00:12.972 --> 00:14.641
- Wait, are we talking about the wedding?
- Yes.

00:14.808 --> 00:16.101
Yeah, I was definitely
one of those people.

00:17.060 --> 00:19.479
And yet, here we are. Now, we got
a lot of family coming in tomorrow.

00:19.562 --> 00:20.855
I'm gonna need everyone's help.

00:21.106 --> 00:23.316
Think of this as
one of your comic book movies.

00:23.400 --> 00:25.652
There's a bunch of superheroes,
each with a different task.

00:25.819 --> 00:27.070
Like the new <i>Avengers.</i>

00:27.237 --> 00:29.572
- Which one was that?
- The one you slept through last weekend.

00:31.032 --> 00:32.117
That was a good nap.

00:33.243 --> 00:36.955
Well, I think it's more like
<i>Lord of the Rings,</i>

00:37.205 --> 00:38.498
and you're the Fellowship.

00:38.665 --> 00:41.668
Someone's got to go to Gondor,
someone's got to go to Mordor,

00:41.751 --> 00:44.254
someone's got to hold off
the demon of shadow and flame.

00:44.421 --> 00:46.423
- You mean the Balrog?
- I mean, my mother.

00:48.216 --> 00:50.719
- That is a perfect metaphor, Amy.
- Thank you.

00:50.802 --> 00:54.681
Because it also involves a ring
that binds me in servitude forever.

00:56.641 --> 00:57.726
He said "forever".

01:25.545 --> 01:28.506
That was Wil Wheaton.
He's really excited about tomorrow.

01:28.798 --> 01:29.841
As am I.

01:30.133 --> 01:31.968
If you'd have told me as a child,

01:32.177 --> 01:35.722
that an actor from <i>Star Trek</i>
would be officiating my wedding,

01:35.889 --> 01:37.766
I would've said, "Ooh! William Shatner?"

01:39.893 --> 01:42.270
And if you'd have said,
"No, Wil Wheaton," I'd have said,

01:42.395 --> 01:44.063
"Well, did you even
try William Shatner?"

01:44.898 --> 01:47.025
And if you'd have said,
"Yes, but he costs too much money,"

01:47.108 --> 01:49.110
I'd have said,
"Well, Wil Wheaton's good, too."

01:50.570 --> 01:52.655
Why do you keep
tying and untying that bow tie?

01:52.947 --> 01:54.449
I can't seem to get it even.

01:54.657 --> 01:58.745
I don't think it's supposed to be even.
Sometimes a little asymmetry looks good.

01:59.037 --> 02:01.206
In the Renaissance,
they called it "sprezzatura."

02:01.498 --> 02:02.749
The Renaissance?

02:03.166 --> 02:05.877
Amy, you know I'm more of
an Enlightenment person.

02:06.878 --> 02:09.214
At some point, we have to decide
how we want to raise the children.

02:11.299 --> 02:15.094
So, are you feeling okay?
No wedding jitters?

02:15.595 --> 02:16.596
No.

02:16.971 --> 02:18.473
There is nothing in the world

02:18.556 --> 02:20.558
that would stop me
from marrying you tomorrow,

02:20.975 --> 02:24.270
even me from the future
coming back to prevent the wedding

02:24.395 --> 02:27.315
and the subsequent birth of a child
who will destroy humanity.

02:29.234 --> 02:30.902
Because if you came from the future,

02:30.985 --> 02:32.987
that would mean you already went through
with the wedding

02:33.071 --> 02:35.615
because you believe that
time travel is on a closed loop.

02:36.783 --> 02:38.117
I love you so damn much.

02:43.623 --> 02:46.251
Mr. Fowler, are you okay back there?
Do you need more air?

02:46.459 --> 02:47.502
He's fine.

02:49.629 --> 02:51.339
I'm surprised Amy didn't pick us up.

02:51.714 --> 02:55.134
Oh. Well, you know, she's pretty busy
the day before her wedding.

02:56.261 --> 03:00.849
Too busy for her mother?
She used to be such a devoted daughter.

03:01.224 --> 03:04.227
Now, she's just waiting for me to die,
so, she can get my china.

03:10.024 --> 03:11.776
Thank you, again, for picking us up.

03:12.443 --> 03:14.070
My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper.

03:14.445 --> 03:17.824
You know, our driver to the airport
was also a Indian fella.

03:19.242 --> 03:20.243
Mom.

03:20.410 --> 03:23.621
Oh, so, now, it's racist to notice
when somebody's Indian?

03:24.163 --> 03:27.083
I don't think it's racist.
I noticed you were both white.

03:29.294 --> 03:33.882
See? You have to excuse her.
She's just pregnant and hormonal.

03:34.382 --> 03:37.218
Yeah, congratulations
on baby number two.

03:37.468 --> 03:38.511
Yeah.

03:39.095 --> 03:40.221
Whoopee!

03:41.598 --> 03:42.849
Her husband would be here,

03:42.932 --> 03:45.226
but he stayed home
to watch their older son,

03:45.310 --> 03:47.979
so, everything's fine.

03:49.314 --> 03:51.858
Stop it. We're separated.

03:53.776 --> 03:54.819
You don't say.

03:57.864 --> 04:00.158
So, you're Sheldon's big brother.

04:00.366 --> 04:03.244
Oh, yeah. He got the brains.
I got the bod.

04:05.163 --> 04:06.789
And the face and the hair.

04:07.874 --> 04:09.125
I like your accent.

04:09.626 --> 04:12.378
Sheldon, did you used to
sound like that? Can you still?

04:16.925 --> 04:19.093
I can. I will not.

04:20.303 --> 04:25.016
Amy, you said something about my bow tie
that I can't stop thinking about.

04:25.475 --> 04:26.851
Don't you mean,

04:26.935 --> 04:28.895
"Y'all said somethin' 'bout my bow tie?"

04:31.356 --> 04:34.567
Go on, say it. Say it.

04:36.527 --> 04:38.613
Hey, guys, look who I have.

04:38.738 --> 04:40.073
- Hey!
- Oh, my God.

04:40.949 --> 04:43.201
- Hey, Shelly.
- I'm so glad you made it, Missy.

04:43.284 --> 04:45.870
This is my fiancee, Amy.
Amy, this is my sister.

04:45.954 --> 04:46.955
Hi.

04:47.038 --> 04:49.082
If I ever need a kidney,
this is where you get it.

04:50.583 --> 04:54.253
It's so nice to meet you.
I've always wanted a sister.

04:54.379 --> 04:55.838
Really? Why?

04:57.215 --> 04:58.383
I love you, too, Sheldon.

04:58.633 --> 04:59.717
Really? Why?

05:01.678 --> 05:02.720
Where's Mom?

05:02.804 --> 05:05.473
She wanted to stop by the hotel
and freshen up,

05:05.598 --> 05:08.059
and then call her pastor
to pray for Missy's soul.

05:09.769 --> 05:10.770
Oh, my God.

05:14.107 --> 05:16.609
- There's mama's girl.
- Hi, Mom.

05:18.236 --> 05:20.905
Oh, Larry, look at her.

05:21.197 --> 05:24.951
Can you believe our little lamb
is finally getting married?

05:25.118 --> 05:26.327
He can't believe it.

05:27.704 --> 05:29.330
And neither can I.

05:30.999 --> 05:32.250
Hi, Dad. How you doing?

05:39.007 --> 05:40.133
What the hell is that?

05:41.592 --> 05:44.679
Come on, you know this one. It's a dog.

05:46.222 --> 05:47.515
I found him in the backyard.

05:47.598 --> 05:49.100
And don't worry,
I already called the owner.

05:49.183 --> 05:50.893
Good, 'cause we don't need a dog.

05:50.977 --> 05:53.146
We already have two babies,
you and Stuart.

05:55.815 --> 05:56.858
That's probably him.

06:02.155 --> 06:03.156
Hi.

06:07.035 --> 06:08.077
I'm gonna need a minute.

06:12.290 --> 06:14.459
That's Mark Hamill!

06:23.634 --> 06:24.635
Hello.

06:25.970 --> 06:31.476
Thank you so much for finding this guy.
Oh, my goodness.

06:31.726 --> 06:34.020
Hey, Bark. How are you, buddy?

06:34.479 --> 06:36.981
Your dog's name is Bark?

06:37.065 --> 06:38.066
Yeah.

06:38.900 --> 06:39.984
Bark Hamill?

06:40.818 --> 06:43.696
Yeah. Well, I let the fans
name him online.

06:44.030 --> 06:46.824
I got lucky, though.
He was almost Honey Baked Hamill.

06:48.034 --> 06:49.410
Anyway, thanks so much.

06:49.494 --> 06:51.537
I want to give you a reward
for finding him.

06:51.621 --> 06:56.125
Oh, no, I couldn't take your money.
It's just an honor to meet you.

06:56.209 --> 06:59.337
No. No, please. You don't know
what this dog means to me,

06:59.420 --> 07:02.632
and I thought
he was gone for good. Please?

07:02.757 --> 07:05.468
There must be something
I can do for you. Anything.

07:06.302 --> 07:07.762
Oh, you're gonna regret that.

07:12.433 --> 07:15.019
- Hey, dude.
- "Dude"?

07:15.311 --> 07:19.232
Yeah, you know, just want you to know
that I don't think of you as a woman.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.734
Oh, perfect.
I don't think of you as a man.

07:22.860 --> 07:23.861
Great.

07:24.028 --> 07:26.906
So, as two genderless blobs
of human flesh,

07:26.989 --> 07:29.826
how would you like to go to
Sheldon and Amy's wedding with me?

07:30.326 --> 07:32.203
Oh. Stuart.

07:32.328 --> 07:34.997
Look, I appreciate that,
but it just might be a little weird,

07:35.081 --> 07:36.207
considering you're my boss.

07:36.374 --> 07:38.417
Guess who's gonna officiate
Sheldon and Amy's wedding.

07:39.043 --> 07:40.128
Mark Hamill!

07:40.545 --> 07:43.214
Luke Skywalker
is gonna be at the wedding!

07:43.589 --> 07:44.715
You'll need to buy me a dress.

07:47.802 --> 07:51.222
And did you know that my Amy played
Amelia Earhart in the eighth grade?

07:51.556 --> 07:53.474
Amy, you never said
you were in a school play.

07:53.558 --> 07:56.561
Oh, no, at home.
I'd never let her do a school play.

07:58.312 --> 08:01.023
Those kids just take drugs
and have intercourse.

08:05.153 --> 08:07.572
You know,
Amy still does some performing.

08:07.780 --> 08:09.699
She and Sheldon
do an Internet show about flags.

08:10.491 --> 08:11.534
Amy?

08:12.160 --> 08:14.328
Videos on the Internet?

08:15.913 --> 08:17.498
You know
what men use those for.

08:18.916 --> 08:22.128
If you're talking about <i>Fun with Flags,</i>
I use it to go to sleep.

08:24.046 --> 08:26.090
Sheldon, you're awfully quiet.
Are you okay?

08:26.716 --> 08:28.551
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.

08:28.676 --> 08:31.888
I was thinking about string theory.
Catch me up. What'd I miss?

08:33.723 --> 08:35.224
Are you seeing this, Larry?

08:36.100 --> 08:38.811
These are the people I'm gonna have to
live with after you're dead.

08:46.611 --> 08:48.696
Welcome, Bert. Don't you look nice.

08:49.071 --> 08:51.657
Yeah. Like a geode, I clean up good.

08:53.409 --> 08:54.952
Don't you crack a geode open?

08:55.119 --> 08:56.871
It's not a perfect metaphor.

08:59.415 --> 09:01.626
Oh, my God. Is that Mark Hamill?

09:01.709 --> 09:02.710
Yeah.

09:02.793 --> 09:05.004
- Oh, my God. Is that...
- Bert, go find your seat!

09:07.173 --> 09:08.507
What is he doing here?

09:08.591 --> 09:12.094
I found his dog and guilted him
into officiating the wedding.

09:12.178 --> 09:13.512
Don't tell Sheldon. It's a surprise.

09:13.596 --> 09:15.556
Wait, I thought
Wil was officiating the wedding.

09:15.640 --> 09:16.849
Yeah, so did he.

09:18.017 --> 09:20.269
- How did he take the news?
- I'll let you know.

09:20.353 --> 09:21.562
Hey, Wil!

09:27.443 --> 09:29.862
Are you having an allergic reaction
to my boutonniere?

09:31.447 --> 09:33.324
No. I'm just so happy for you.

09:34.533 --> 09:35.534
And for me.

09:35.701 --> 09:37.703
After today, you are officially,

09:37.787 --> 09:40.498
and more important,
legally, Amy's problem.

09:42.458 --> 09:46.796
Don't be silly, Leonard.
I will always be your problem.

09:55.137 --> 09:56.222
Hey, baby.

09:56.430 --> 09:57.431
Hello, Mother.

09:57.682 --> 09:59.183
Leonard, could you give us a moment?

09:59.350 --> 10:00.393
Of course.

10:02.645 --> 10:04.814
Oh, Shelly...

10:07.817 --> 10:09.777
I wish your dad could see you now.

10:10.152 --> 10:12.697
Me, too. I miss him.

10:13.572 --> 10:17.118
He would be so proud of you.
I know that I am.

10:18.035 --> 10:19.036
Thank you.

10:20.496 --> 10:24.166
I mean, for everything. My whole life.

10:30.923 --> 10:32.258
Let me straighten your tie.

10:32.341 --> 10:33.634
No, it's all right.

10:33.968 --> 10:36.762
It's supposed to be
a little asymmetrical.

10:37.138 --> 10:40.516
Apparently, a small flaw
somehow improves it.

10:40.599 --> 10:41.642
I can see that.

10:43.311 --> 10:47.481
Sometimes, it's the imperfect stuff

10:48.107 --> 10:49.734
that makes things perfect.

10:53.904 --> 10:54.947
Excuse me.

10:59.702 --> 11:00.953
Case in point.

11:04.874 --> 11:06.834
So, we finally meet.

11:08.794 --> 11:10.004
I'm sorry, who are you?

11:12.506 --> 11:13.507
I'm Wil Wheaton.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.718
I was supposed to
officiate this wedding.

11:16.177 --> 11:18.179
I was up all night,
preparing these notes.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.599
Well, thanks so much.
It's gonna be a great help.

11:26.270 --> 11:28.397
Amy. Amy.

11:28.689 --> 11:31.734
- Amy.
- Come in.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.028
There's
something I need to tell you.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.364
Wow, you look amazing!

11:37.323 --> 11:39.408
That's not what I need to tell you.
But you do.

11:39.492 --> 11:42.787
- What's wrong?
- Something incredible just happened.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.955
Remember when you were telling me
about my bow tie,

11:45.039 --> 11:47.583
- and how a little asymmetry is good?
- Yeah?

11:47.666 --> 11:51.462
My equations have been trying
to describe an imperfect world,

11:51.629 --> 11:52.797
and the only way to do that

11:52.880 --> 11:55.800
is to introduce imperfection
into the underlying theory.

11:56.550 --> 12:01.597
So, instead of supersymmetry,
it would be super asymmetry?

12:02.556 --> 12:04.975
Super asymmetry. That's it!

12:07.019 --> 12:08.354
- Give me your lipstick.
- What?

12:08.437 --> 12:10.314
Just give it to me,
you beautiful thing! We have work to do!

12:13.526 --> 12:17.613
Hey, the bride and groom
seem to be running a little behind.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.073
Do you think you could stall?

12:19.532 --> 12:20.616
Stall? How?

12:22.243 --> 12:23.577
Hey, everybody!

12:23.828 --> 12:25.746
It's gonna be a few more minutes,
but while we wait,

12:25.830 --> 12:28.749
does anyone have
any questions about <i>Star Wars?</i>

12:36.382 --> 12:37.383
You got this.

12:40.845 --> 12:44.432
So, if I make slightly asymmetric knots
with sheets in four dimensions,

12:44.515 --> 12:48.936
I can bootstrap the whole idea to
a large asymmetry in 11 dimensions.

12:49.353 --> 12:51.605
Well, maybe even at
the initial moment of creation,

12:51.689 --> 12:53.399
the fundamental forces lacked symmetry.

12:55.985 --> 12:57.736
Everyone's waiting.
What are you guys doing?

12:58.028 --> 12:59.113
Super asymmetry.

12:59.572 --> 13:01.449
Super asymmetry? Is that a thing?

13:01.615 --> 13:03.033
We're inventing it right now.

13:03.409 --> 13:05.661
Don't you think this can wait until...

13:05.828 --> 13:08.330
Hold on. This is interesting.

13:11.542 --> 13:12.793
So, yeah, Mr. Mark?

13:13.961 --> 13:16.922
When you were on
the Wookiee home planet,

13:17.047 --> 13:19.467
how did you even understand
what they were saying?

13:20.134 --> 13:22.720
I don't remember ever being
on a Wookiee home planet.

13:24.388 --> 13:27.600
Actually, Luke was on
the Wookiee home planet, Kashyyyk,

13:27.683 --> 13:31.020
in the <i>Holiday Special,</i> when
he helped Chewie get home to his wife.

13:33.564 --> 13:34.607
Chewie had a wife?

13:36.275 --> 13:37.401
Her name's Malla.

13:38.194 --> 13:39.570
Wow, that's impressive.

13:40.029 --> 13:41.030
Yeah.

13:42.615 --> 13:44.158
Hey, I got a question.

13:44.825 --> 13:47.870
Why aren't there tires
on any of those <i>Star Wars</i> vehicles?

13:50.247 --> 13:52.541
I'm sure some of them had tires.

13:52.708 --> 13:53.834
Actually, they don't.

13:54.335 --> 13:58.756
I mean, the HAVw A5 Turbo Tank
has metal-gripping wheels,

13:58.839 --> 14:00.257
but I wouldn't call them tires.

14:02.885 --> 14:04.512
You are so hot.

14:10.559 --> 14:15.064
This is taking too long.
I bet that Sheldon stood my baby up.

14:16.273 --> 14:17.816
Excuse me. Where are you going?

14:18.192 --> 14:20.236
This whole thing was a big mistake.

14:20.569 --> 14:22.071
I'm gonna find Amy
and get her out of here.

14:22.154 --> 14:23.322
Sit down!

14:25.574 --> 14:26.784
Excuse me?

14:27.493 --> 14:29.078
Sheldon loves Amy,

14:29.161 --> 14:31.789
and he would never hurt her
on her wedding day, or any other day,

14:31.872 --> 14:32.873
so, park it.

14:40.005 --> 14:41.006
Oh, you sit down, too.

14:43.759 --> 14:47.179
Are you gonna let her
talk to me like that? Say something.

14:49.431 --> 14:50.432
Thank you.

14:53.394 --> 14:57.064
According to Google, there are zero
papers that mention super asymmetry.

14:57.147 --> 14:59.108
This is brand-new.
No one's thought of it.

15:00.568 --> 15:02.319
What are you lunatics doing?

15:03.529 --> 15:04.863
Sheldon had a breakthrough.

15:05.114 --> 15:07.116
Actually, Amy and I had a breakthrough.

15:07.324 --> 15:09.118
Science? Shocking.

15:10.578 --> 15:12.454
You don't understand.
This could be really big.

15:12.538 --> 15:13.789
No, Penny's right.

15:15.249 --> 15:17.668
We have our whole lives
to do science together.

15:20.629 --> 15:21.714
Let's get married.

15:22.256 --> 15:25.092
All right. It's go time. I am pumped!

15:31.807 --> 15:33.434
Okay, everyone. Here we go.

15:37.479 --> 15:38.480
Leonard.

15:39.607 --> 15:41.817
That's Mark Ha...

15:44.820 --> 15:47.031
It's Mark Hami...

15:48.532 --> 15:50.784
Yep. Thank Wolowitz. He set it up.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.457
Congratulations on your wedding.

15:56.832 --> 15:57.833
Thank you.

15:58.459 --> 16:01.337
When this is over,
I have 4,000 things for you to sign.

16:20.481 --> 16:21.482
Thank you, Daddy.

16:27.946 --> 16:29.406
I thought Wil was marrying us.

16:30.199 --> 16:31.867
Wolowitz got us an upgrade.

16:33.786 --> 16:36.955
Another sci-fi guy with a beard.
Seems lateral, but okay.

16:38.832 --> 16:39.833
Welcome.

16:40.250 --> 16:44.588
We are gathered here today
in the sight of family, friends,

16:45.089 --> 16:46.090
and Almighty God.

16:46.215 --> 16:47.591
That's too religious.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.551
That lady over there made me say it.

16:51.178 --> 16:54.306
He heard you, and He can't un-hear you.

16:58.227 --> 17:00.854
We're here to celebrate the marriage

17:01.271 --> 17:05.317
of Sheldon Lee Cooper
and Amy Farrah Fowler.

17:05.984 --> 17:06.985
I had more prepared,

17:07.069 --> 17:09.446
but I'm just gonna skip
to the rings and vows,

17:09.530 --> 17:12.157
since I've been answering your questions
for 45 minutes.

17:13.534 --> 17:14.827
Yeah, he answered 'em.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.997
Amy, you're up.

17:24.712 --> 17:28.424
Sheldon, when I was a little girl,

17:28.882 --> 17:32.720
I used to dream about my wedding,
but eventually, I stopped,

17:32.970 --> 17:36.098
because I thought
that day would never come.

17:37.141 --> 17:38.267
And then I met you.

17:38.934 --> 17:41.311
From the first moment
in that coffee shop,

17:41.895 --> 17:44.273
I knew that there was
something special between us,

17:45.441 --> 17:48.402
even though I did work on a study
that disproved love at first sight.

17:50.446 --> 17:52.531
I loved that study the moment I read it.

17:53.490 --> 17:54.575
Ironic, huh?

17:56.744 --> 17:58.412
Clearly, it was wrong.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.166
Because I felt something that day,

18:03.459 --> 18:06.044
and those feelings
have only gotten stronger with time.

18:08.464 --> 18:11.675
I can't imagine loving you
more than I do right now.

18:12.092 --> 18:16.346
But I felt that way yesterday,
and the day before yesterday,

18:17.014 --> 18:18.515
and the day before that.

18:19.558 --> 18:22.352
Is that growth linear, or accelerating?

18:23.228 --> 18:24.480
Accelerating.

18:24.605 --> 18:26.023
Oh, maybe we could graph it out.

18:28.192 --> 18:29.485
Save something for the honeymoon.

18:30.986 --> 18:32.029
Smart.

18:34.448 --> 18:35.491
Sheldon,

18:36.658 --> 18:38.368
I don't know what the future holds,

18:39.036 --> 18:44.458
but I know that I've never been happier
than I am in this moment, marrying you.

18:48.086 --> 18:50.088
Well, that was
unexpectedly beautiful.

18:53.717 --> 18:54.760
I might need a minute.

19:02.559 --> 19:03.560
Amy,

19:08.065 --> 19:10.067
I usually know exactly what to say.

19:12.528 --> 19:13.737
But, in this moment,

19:16.198 --> 19:17.407
I have no words.

19:20.118 --> 19:21.787
I guess,

19:25.249 --> 19:26.834
I'm overwhelmed by you.

19:28.877 --> 19:30.003
In a good way.

19:30.754 --> 19:32.965
Not in the elevator
in the Haunted Mansion way.

19:35.217 --> 19:39.972
Even if I can't tell you now,
how I feel,

19:41.932 --> 19:45.477
I will spend my life
showing you how much I love you.

19:50.983 --> 19:52.192
Do you...

19:56.113 --> 19:57.114
Do you...

19:58.657 --> 20:02.369
Hey, I'm just sayin', I'm here,
if you need me to step in.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.664
No, no, no. I got this.

20:08.292 --> 20:13.297
Amy, do you take Sheldon
for your lawful wedded husband?

20:13.589 --> 20:14.715
I do.

20:15.090 --> 20:16.633
And, Sheldon, same thing.

20:21.471 --> 20:22.472
I do.

20:23.557 --> 20:25.309
Then by the power vested in me,

20:26.268 --> 20:28.520
by even-you-can-perform-weddings-dot-com

20:30.772 --> 20:33.191
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

20:33.984 --> 20:35.193
You may kiss the bride.

20:45.245 --> 20:49.833
<i>At wast</i>

20:52.002 --> 20:55.213
<i>My wove has come awong</i>

20:58.717 --> 21:02.137
<i>My wonewy days are over</i>

21:06.058 --> 21:09.061
<i>And wife is wike a song</i>

21:12.189 --> 21:13.231
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
