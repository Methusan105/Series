00:03.546 --> 00:06.633
Why are they making
four more <i>Avatar</i> movies?

00:06.883 --> 00:08.802
It's not like the first one
was even that good.

00:09.219 --> 00:11.096
What are you talking about?
You love that movie.

00:11.179 --> 00:13.098
You even went as <i>Avatar</i>
for Halloween.

00:13.515 --> 00:16.351
I remember. That was
not a lot of clothes.

00:18.937 --> 00:19.938
Hey, guys.

00:20.021 --> 00:21.022
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:21.106 --> 00:24.025
I'm, I'm running a special today.

00:24.234 --> 00:27.320
Buy something, keep having
a comic book store to come to.

00:28.822 --> 00:31.449
Well, this is awkward.
I was actually gonna return this.

00:32.534 --> 00:34.661
- What's wrong with it?
- I finished it.

00:37.330 --> 00:39.541
Speaking of something
I find interesting,

00:39.624 --> 00:42.460
did anyone read that article
about Bitcoin I sent you?

00:42.669 --> 00:44.337
Yeah, I can't believe
a single Bitcoin

00:44.421 --> 00:46.756
is worth about $5,000 now.

00:47.048 --> 00:50.343
Wait, didn't we mine some
a few years ago?

00:50.510 --> 00:52.262
Yeah, it was seven years ago.

00:52.554 --> 00:54.723
Oh. Yeah, I remember that.

00:54.806 --> 00:56.766
Really? All I can remember
from seven years ago

00:56.850 --> 00:59.519
is I couldn't get Kesha's
"Tik Tok" out of my head.

01:00.854 --> 01:02.480
<i>Tik Tok, on the clock</i>

01:02.564 --> 01:04.190
Whoa, welcome home, Kesha.

01:05.400 --> 01:07.193
No, we definitely mined some.

01:07.277 --> 01:09.904
I remember sitting in your bedroom
and writing the program.

01:10.029 --> 01:11.740
I think we ended up
with a bunch of it.

01:11.823 --> 01:14.951
Wow, and at, like,
$5,000 apiece, that's...

01:15.034 --> 01:18.496
Sounds like a lot of money,
which we agreed to share

01:18.580 --> 01:22.000
'cause I was totally there.
I remember now.

01:23.793 --> 01:26.755
- I can't believe we forgot about it.
- It's not that surprising.

01:26.838 --> 01:28.590
They were basically worthless
when we got them.

01:28.965 --> 01:30.800
I wish I knew how much we had.

01:30.967 --> 01:32.510
Sheldon, you must remember.

01:32.677 --> 01:34.053
Of course I do.

01:34.179 --> 01:36.014
Oh, yeah, he and I totally remember.

01:38.057 --> 01:39.517
You tell them, Sheldon.

01:42.479 --> 01:43.980
I can't believe you haven't
seen <i>Avatar</i> yet.

01:44.063 --> 01:45.315
What is wrong with you?

01:45.565 --> 01:49.027
Penny and I just started dating,
and you know I don't like big crowds.

01:49.152 --> 01:51.196
Because you're afraid Penny will
leave you for someone in them?

01:51.279 --> 01:52.322
Terrified.

01:53.865 --> 01:55.074
Yes, instead of going out,

01:55.158 --> 01:57.577
they just stay home
and have constant coitus.

01:57.786 --> 02:01.748
Well, I didn't want to say it,
but I do like to hear it.

02:03.458 --> 02:05.877
Yes, Ma, I'll be home for dinner.

02:07.086 --> 02:09.881
No, I'm not ruining
my appetite with candy.

02:11.633 --> 02:13.176
We're having brisket?

02:14.219 --> 02:15.553
Be home at 6:00.

02:17.096 --> 02:18.431
Hey, maybe we should double date.

02:18.515 --> 02:20.266
I'll bring Penny
and you can bring your mom.

02:21.976 --> 02:24.938
Make your jokes, but my date started
a savings account for me.

02:25.021 --> 02:26.022
Did yours?

02:27.857 --> 02:29.067
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey.

02:29.150 --> 02:30.443
Stuart, good. I was wondering,

02:30.610 --> 02:32.362
will you be accepting Bitcoin?

02:33.112 --> 02:35.532
Well, I don't know what that is,
but it's got "coin" in it,

02:35.615 --> 02:39.035
and my cash register doesn't,
so yeah.

02:41.496 --> 02:42.705
Wait, what's Bitcoin?

02:42.789 --> 02:45.333
It's a new online currency
that's been developed.

02:45.583 --> 02:46.918
It's just like actual money,

02:47.001 --> 02:49.963
except you can't see it, hold
it, or spend it on anything.

02:51.589 --> 02:54.175
Sounds like the kind of money
I'm familiar with.

02:55.969 --> 02:57.595
If it's not tangible,
how do you know

02:57.679 --> 02:59.514
it's not just gonna
vanish tomorrow?

02:59.889 --> 03:02.267
Really? You're dating Penny, and
you're gonna poke at something

03:02.350 --> 03:03.768
that could vanish tomorrow?

03:05.562 --> 03:06.688
I'll buy some Bitcoin.

03:06.771 --> 03:08.273
I just came into a little extra money

03:08.356 --> 03:09.899
when my dad raised my allowance.

03:11.943 --> 03:13.778
You don't have to buy Bitcoin.

03:13.862 --> 03:15.029
You can mine it.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.282
Mine it?
Like, mining gold?

03:17.365 --> 03:19.367
Sort of. There's a limited amount,

03:19.450 --> 03:21.828
and we find it,
not by tunneling into the earth,

03:21.911 --> 03:25.206
but by using a computer to solve
complex mathematical problems.

03:25.331 --> 03:26.332
So let me get this straight.

03:26.416 --> 03:28.126
We have to write an elaborate program

03:28.209 --> 03:32.046
in order to find a fake coin
that we can't spend on anything?

03:32.130 --> 03:34.007
- Yes.
- That sounds fun.

03:34.924 --> 03:35.925
Yeah, I'm in.

03:36.009 --> 03:37.010
Staying up late,

03:37.093 --> 03:39.178
writing code, it sounds like a party.

03:39.262 --> 03:41.890
Hey, Stuart.
You want to mine some Bitcoin with us?

03:42.015 --> 03:43.600
We'll write the program,
you bring the snacks?

03:43.808 --> 03:45.184
Too rich for my blood.

03:46.936 --> 03:48.688
All right, so just the four of us.

03:48.897 --> 03:50.565
Before we begin,

03:50.648 --> 03:53.818
this may have some
unprecedented tax implications.

03:53.902 --> 03:55.570
In fact, we should start
early 'cause we are gonna be

03:55.653 --> 03:57.864
on the phone with
the IRS for hours.

03:57.947 --> 04:00.241
Did anybody else
just get goose bumps?

04:01.743 --> 04:03.870
Great, so just the three of us.

04:05.038 --> 04:07.165
Oh, yeah. We did it without you.

04:07.248 --> 04:09.542
And do you remember
what happened next?

04:09.626 --> 04:11.961
Your mom called my mom
and said we were being mean?

04:13.546 --> 04:15.340
And after that?

04:16.674 --> 04:19.427
You said that someday
we'd regret this.

04:19.802 --> 04:22.180
And do you know what today is?

04:22.555 --> 04:25.683
The day we found out we're rich
and none of it is yours?

04:28.394 --> 04:30.480
Yeah, that's right! Up top!

04:57.799 --> 05:01.886
Okay, this is the laptop
I was using in 2010.

05:01.970 --> 05:03.721
The Bitcoin must be on here.

05:04.222 --> 05:06.432
So what are you gonna do
with your share of the money?

05:06.516 --> 05:07.767
Ah, well, as a responsible adult,

05:07.850 --> 05:10.395
I'll put that money into a CD,
wait for that CD to mature,

05:10.645 --> 05:12.522
and then buy a tiger.

05:19.153 --> 05:20.238
How about you?

05:20.321 --> 05:22.782
That depends on
whether I tell Bernadette or not.

05:24.659 --> 05:25.743
<i>Howard, I can hear you.</i>

05:25.827 --> 05:27.620
<i>The baby monitor is on.</i>

05:29.831 --> 05:31.082
I know. I was joking.

05:31.582 --> 05:33.918
I'm gonna put it in a college fund.

05:38.631 --> 05:40.550
All right, all booted up.

05:41.092 --> 05:43.970
Wow, I knew you were single back then,
but that is a lot of porn...

05:44.053 --> 05:46.431
Science! A lot of science.

05:47.515 --> 05:50.268
Wow, you were really into Asian science.

05:53.062 --> 05:54.355
I don't see the Bitcoin on here.

05:54.689 --> 05:57.817
Hey, maybe it's in that folder marked
"Private and Confidential."

05:58.026 --> 05:59.360
<i>It's not!</i>

06:01.696 --> 06:03.906
Okay, the program
is almost ready to run.

06:03.990 --> 06:06.576
Mining for coins sounds so manly.

06:06.743 --> 06:08.494
Ooh, we should sing a mining song.

06:09.954 --> 06:11.247
Do you know a mining song?

06:11.706 --> 06:12.749
I don't know.

06:12.832 --> 06:14.167
Does "Tik Tok" by Kesha count?

06:14.250 --> 06:16.461
Because it has tunneled
its way into my heart.

06:18.504 --> 06:20.214
<i>Howard, what's going on?</i>

06:20.298 --> 06:22.050
<i>Are you boys roughhousing?</i>

06:22.467 --> 06:24.427
No, we're not roughhousing!

06:24.510 --> 06:27.138
We're scientists!
Scientists don't roughhouse!

06:28.389 --> 06:31.184
<i>Excuse me, Mr. Grown-up.</i>

06:33.311 --> 06:34.520
Aw, man, what happened?

06:34.604 --> 06:35.772
It crashed.

06:35.897 --> 06:37.440
It's been doing that lately.

06:37.523 --> 06:39.817
I think it's got a virus from all the
music I've been downloading.

06:40.026 --> 06:42.153
Music I've been downloading.

06:43.404 --> 06:44.655
What kind of music?

06:45.198 --> 06:46.616
Mostly Asian.

06:49.619 --> 06:51.079
Some oldies.

06:52.246 --> 06:53.956
Well, we can use my laptop.

06:54.665 --> 06:56.626
<i>Howard, I made cookies</i>

06:56.709 --> 06:58.836
<i>for you and your little friends!</i>

06:58.920 --> 07:01.881
They're not my little friends,
and we don't want cookies!

07:01.964 --> 07:02.965
Actually, a cookie sounds good.

07:03.049 --> 07:04.217
All right, we'll have cookies!

07:04.300 --> 07:05.635
Thank you very much!

07:07.178 --> 07:09.263
That's right.
It must be on my old laptop.

07:09.347 --> 07:10.348
Well, let's go.

07:10.431 --> 07:12.058
Hey, Bernie, you mind
if I run to Leonard's and...

07:12.141 --> 07:13.518
<i>Get a laptop full of money?</i>

07:13.601 --> 07:15.937
<i>Why are you still here?
Go, go, go!</i>

07:19.524 --> 07:21.025
So, how's the wedding planning going?

07:21.651 --> 07:24.529
Great. Although, we're having trouble
agreeing on a location.

07:25.029 --> 07:26.781
I thought you were looking
at a cliff on the beach.

07:26.864 --> 07:29.867
We were, but Sheldon
didn't like any of them.

07:31.619 --> 07:34.372
Some were too beachy,
some were too cliffy.

07:35.957 --> 07:38.793
And all of them
were too outsidey.

07:39.919 --> 07:41.879
Well, weddings aren't
about the location.

07:41.963 --> 07:44.090
They're about standing up in
front of your family and friends

07:44.173 --> 07:47.051
and promising that Sheldon
will never move back in here.

07:49.345 --> 07:51.055
- Hi.
<i>- Hey.</i>

07:51.305 --> 07:52.306
What are you guys doing?

07:52.473 --> 07:54.600
We have a bunch of Bitcoin
on an old laptop,

07:54.684 --> 07:56.477
and it could be worth,
like, a lot of money.

07:56.561 --> 07:57.562
What... You're kidding.

07:57.645 --> 07:59.814
No. We could be sitting on a fortune.

07:59.897 --> 08:02.191
Okay, let the record show,
I did not marry you for the money,

08:02.275 --> 08:04.110
but you just got
way more attractive.

08:05.361 --> 08:07.155
Damn it, it's not in here.

08:07.405 --> 08:10.950
If only you had someone around
with an eidetic memory.

08:12.994 --> 08:15.163
I bet they would know
what happened to it.

08:15.246 --> 08:16.831
If you know, just tell us.

08:16.914 --> 08:19.834
Well, excuse me, but if I recall
from seven years ago,

08:19.917 --> 08:21.836
you don't want me
to be a part of this.

08:22.086 --> 08:24.005
Sheldon, you can't still be mad.

08:24.130 --> 08:25.131
Oh, please.

08:25.214 --> 08:26.966
I have grudges that
go back to preschool.

08:29.010 --> 08:31.137
Someday, I'm gonna find
a grown-up Elaine Dwyer

08:31.220 --> 08:33.598
and eat her favorite crayon
while she watches.

08:34.807 --> 08:37.935
Is that why there's an
Elaine Dwyer on our guest list?

08:39.103 --> 08:41.814
Yes. That night,
I'm going to have the first dance

08:41.898 --> 08:43.441
and the last laugh.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.776
Sheldon, please.

08:48.029 --> 08:49.113
Should I be the bigger man?

08:49.780 --> 08:50.823
I think you should.

08:50.907 --> 08:52.658
Why'd I ask you?

08:56.954 --> 08:58.247
Hey there, pretty lady.

08:58.331 --> 09:00.291
I'm not waiting on your table for you.

09:00.833 --> 09:03.419
Come on, this one is so annoying.

09:03.544 --> 09:04.837
Excuse me, waitress.

09:07.798 --> 09:08.799
You guys ready to order?

09:08.883 --> 09:10.134
Can you take our picture, please?

09:10.218 --> 09:11.677
Oh, sure.

09:12.011 --> 09:13.221
Smile!

09:16.933 --> 09:18.267
Perfect.

09:18.434 --> 09:19.977
Thank you. You may go now.

09:20.645 --> 09:22.104
It was nice to meet you,

09:22.188 --> 09:24.565
and I mean that politely,
not sincerely.

09:26.817 --> 09:27.860
What was that?

09:27.944 --> 09:30.029
I need to prove to my mother
that I'm on a date.

09:30.112 --> 09:31.322
If she thinks
I faked the picture,

09:31.405 --> 09:33.241
I might need you as a witness.
What's your name?

09:34.533 --> 09:35.910
Bernadette.

09:37.703 --> 09:38.788
- Hey, sweetie. Everybody good?
- Hey.

09:38.913 --> 09:40.665
- Yeah.
- Fine.

09:42.833 --> 09:45.962
You don't have to whisper,
you can just nod your head.

09:48.714 --> 09:50.007
Or you could just speak.

09:52.635 --> 09:54.679
- You having a good day?
- No, I missed an audition

09:54.762 --> 09:56.681
because my computer broke,
and I didn't get the e-mail.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.557
Would've been a perfect part for me.

09:58.641 --> 10:00.351
Was it waitress
who ignores her customers?

10:00.434 --> 10:02.395
Because that's the role
you were born to play.

10:04.397 --> 10:06.107
Just shut up and eat your burger.

10:06.190 --> 10:07.692
Actually, it's a turkey club.

10:07.775 --> 10:08.985
Didn't you order a burger?

10:09.068 --> 10:10.987
I did, and yet here we are.

10:13.114 --> 10:15.491
You know what, if you need a computer,
you can use my laptop.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.660
That's sweet, but I'm not
gonna take your computer.

10:17.743 --> 10:19.287
It's fine.
I'm getting a new one anyway.

10:19.412 --> 10:21.205
- Are you sure?
- Don't be silly.

10:21.289 --> 10:22.707
He's desperate
to hold on to you.

10:22.790 --> 10:24.417
You can get anything out of him.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.210
His car, his watch...

10:26.294 --> 10:28.212
Maybe a kidney.
You already have his testicles.

10:28.296 --> 10:29.922
You can start a collection.

10:32.258 --> 10:34.385
Oh, my God, that's right.
You gave me your laptop.

10:34.468 --> 10:35.636
That was so sweet.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.179
- So you know where it is?
- Of course.

10:37.263 --> 10:38.431
- Great!
- All right!

10:38.514 --> 10:40.016
I gave it to my ex-boyfriend Zack.

10:40.099 --> 10:41.892
- No!
- Why?

10:47.231 --> 10:50.151
Okay, Zack, thank you so much.
We'll be right over.

10:50.651 --> 10:52.028
He still has it.

10:52.570 --> 10:54.447
I can't believe you took
a gift from me

10:54.530 --> 10:55.990
and gave it to another man.

10:56.532 --> 10:57.533
<i>Really?</i>

10:57.616 --> 10:59.410
Of all the things she's given
to other men,

10:59.493 --> 11:00.995
that's what you're
concerned about?

11:03.748 --> 11:05.499
Please don't make
a big deal about this.

11:05.583 --> 11:07.460
It was a long time ago,
we were broken up.

11:07.543 --> 11:11.088
Which breakup was that? Was that
the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre?

11:12.381 --> 11:13.382
No, no.

11:13.466 --> 11:15.926
This might've been during
the Comic-Con Dump-A-Thon.

11:16.886 --> 11:18.220
You have names for our breakups?

11:18.471 --> 11:20.514
Well, they would really
blur together if we didn't.

11:22.183 --> 11:23.851
The Comic-Con breakup's
easy to remember

11:23.934 --> 11:26.103
because Leonard
was the saddest Pikachu.

11:28.189 --> 11:29.982
Right, and he wiped his nose
on your cape,

11:30.066 --> 11:32.360
and then you were
the saddest Darth Vader.

11:34.487 --> 11:37.573
You know, Penny and I aren't
the only ones who've broken up.

11:37.656 --> 11:39.116
So did Howard and Bernadette.

11:39.700 --> 11:43.037
Not to brag, but all
my breakups have lasted.

11:46.290 --> 11:47.875
I'm so sorry to hear
about you and Howard.

11:47.958 --> 11:49.877
Thanks. I just didn't think he was

11:49.960 --> 11:52.713
the kind of guy who would be
doing weird stuff online.

11:53.130 --> 11:55.841
Really? Wow, I thought
it was so obvious, but okay.

11:57.218 --> 11:59.011
Look, I know it's hard,
but I think the best thing

11:59.095 --> 12:01.013
to do after a breakup
is to take some time

12:01.097 --> 12:02.223
and be by yourself.

12:02.598 --> 12:04.225
Yeah, that's healthy.

12:04.517 --> 12:05.726
Hey, babe, ready to go?

12:06.769 --> 12:08.354
Do as I say, not as I do.

12:12.858 --> 12:14.193
I cannot believe you're mad.

12:14.276 --> 12:15.569
What... I'm not mad.

12:15.653 --> 12:17.863
Oh. Really? Tell that to your eyebrows.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.617
Bet I could place
a quarter between them,

12:21.700 --> 12:23.035
and it would just stay there.

12:25.579 --> 12:26.580
Fine, I'm mad.

12:26.664 --> 12:28.999
I guess I was more upset
by our breakup than you.

12:29.208 --> 12:31.210
That is not true.
Of course I was upset.

12:31.627 --> 12:32.711
Didn't seem like it.

12:32.795 --> 12:34.004
You started dating the first

12:34.088 --> 12:36.132
tall, handsome hunk
you could find.

12:36.841 --> 12:40.636
I'm sorry, are you mad
that I dated Zack or that you didn't?

12:47.393 --> 12:49.228
- Hi.
- Hey, Zack.

12:49.395 --> 12:51.147
So good to see you guys.

12:51.355 --> 12:53.274
Man, we should
do this more often.

12:54.650 --> 12:56.902
Come over to get laptops
back from you?

12:56.986 --> 12:58.237
Totally.

12:59.864 --> 13:00.865
So do you have it?

13:00.948 --> 13:02.825
Of course I do.
Penny gave it to me as a gift.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.535
You don't get rid
of something like that.

13:08.581 --> 13:09.582
Huh.

13:10.791 --> 13:13.043
All right, I'm sorry
I gave away your stupid laptop.

13:13.127 --> 13:15.337
You should be. We were broken
up for, like, five minutes.

13:15.463 --> 13:16.464
Are you guys fighting?

13:16.547 --> 13:17.548
- Yeah.
- No.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.508
Are you fighting about
whether or not you're fighting?

13:19.592 --> 13:21.051
'Cause I've had that fight before.

13:21.260 --> 13:23.137
Turns out we were, and I lost.

13:24.472 --> 13:26.557
Leonard thinks when we broke up,
it didn't bother me.

13:26.640 --> 13:27.641
That's crazy.

13:27.725 --> 13:30.227
When we were going out, she used
to talk about you all the time.

13:30.311 --> 13:32.188
In fact, I think
she only dated me

13:32.271 --> 13:33.814
because I reminded her of you.

13:38.068 --> 13:39.195
Sure.

13:40.946 --> 13:42.823
Because we're both

13:42.907 --> 13:44.742
people?

13:45.284 --> 13:47.036
Damn right we are.

13:48.704 --> 13:51.290
Oh, also, there was that video
about how much she missed you.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.959
- What video?
- The one on the laptop.

13:54.376 --> 13:57.546
I didn't mean to invade your
privacy, but I am a huge snoop.

13:57.922 --> 13:59.798
Ask my neighbor. She'll tell you.

13:59.882 --> 14:01.509
But not right now, she's in the shower.

14:10.226 --> 14:12.478
Hello, Leonard.

14:12.728 --> 14:16.023
I was gonna write you an e-mail,
but I'm a little drunk,

14:16.106 --> 14:19.860
and spelling is
a sober person's game, so...

14:22.655 --> 14:24.907
I feel I owe you a 'splanation.

14:25.908 --> 14:28.327
I... I'm sorry.

14:28.536 --> 14:30.246
A 'splanation.

14:32.081 --> 14:33.832
<i>Penny. Penny.</i>

14:33.999 --> 14:35.000
<i>Penny.</i>

14:35.084 --> 14:37.294
Sheldon, go away.
I'm making a video.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.838
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll come back when you're alone.

14:41.173 --> 14:42.883
No, no, no. I am alone.

14:42.967 --> 14:45.386
I'm just telling Leonard
why I broke up with him.

14:45.761 --> 14:47.179
Oh, he knows.

14:47.263 --> 14:48.472
The video I want to see

14:48.556 --> 14:50.349
is why you went out with him
in the first place.

14:52.226 --> 14:54.520
I went out with him
because he's great.

14:54.603 --> 14:57.439
And if I kept going out with him,
I probably would've married him,

14:57.523 --> 14:59.275
and that's a little scary

14:59.358 --> 15:01.068
because I just don't think
I'm ready for that.

15:01.360 --> 15:05.030
You know, plus I have got to
learn how to spell Hofstadter.

15:06.407 --> 15:07.783
I know there's a "D" in there,

15:07.866 --> 15:10.828
but it keeps moving
every time I try and write it.

15:12.454 --> 15:14.540
Sheldon, what do I do?

15:15.332 --> 15:18.210
Try to pass out face down,
so you don't choke on your vomit.

15:20.045 --> 15:22.548
<i>I am not gonna pass out.</i>

15:22.965 --> 15:25.050
But thank you anyway.

15:30.389 --> 15:32.516
- Wow.
- I know.

15:32.808 --> 15:35.102
There's, like, two more hours
of her just lying there.

15:38.355 --> 15:41.442
Aw, you love me so much.

15:41.609 --> 15:43.611
- I married you, jackass.
- Yeah.

15:43.694 --> 15:45.821
I... I know, and not just out of pity

15:45.946 --> 15:48.157
like everyone said at our wedding toast.

15:49.617 --> 15:51.285
You want to see the part
where she falls off the chair?

15:51.368 --> 15:53.078
- No.
- Totally.

16:04.465 --> 16:07.217
That's my wife.

16:07.593 --> 16:09.345
I got to see that again.

16:11.722 --> 16:13.057
- Got the laptop.
- Hand it here.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.433
Yep.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.769
This is so exciting!

16:16.852 --> 16:19.313
Hey, when we sell the Bitcoin,
are you gonna pay your dad back

16:19.396 --> 16:20.939
all the money you took from him
over the years?

16:21.023 --> 16:23.359
Never even crossed my mind.

16:25.402 --> 16:26.612
Okay, here's the Bitcoin folder.

16:26.695 --> 16:28.405
Yeah, how much is in there?

16:30.741 --> 16:31.825
It's empty.

16:31.909 --> 16:33.327
What? That's impossible.

16:34.703 --> 16:36.205
Do you think Zack stole it?

16:36.288 --> 16:38.165
He doesn't know how to steal Bitcoin.

16:38.248 --> 16:40.084
I mean, he waves at trucks.

16:42.836 --> 16:43.837
Hmm.

16:43.921 --> 16:46.006
Who could it have been?

16:48.717 --> 16:50.260
Sheldon, what did you do?

16:50.427 --> 16:51.929
I plotted my revenge.

16:52.388 --> 16:54.890
If you get a dish,
I'll serve you some cold.

16:56.433 --> 16:58.852
What, you stole our Bitcoin?

16:58.936 --> 17:01.855
Oh, calm down.
All I did was sneak onto your computer

17:01.939 --> 17:04.441
and download your Bitcoin
onto a flash drive.

17:04.566 --> 17:06.860
- What?
- But I'm not keeping it.

17:06.944 --> 17:08.779
I just wanted
to watch you sweat.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.197
If you want to watch him sweat,

17:10.280 --> 17:12.366
walk up a flight
of stairs with him.

17:14.284 --> 17:18.372
I've waited seven long years,
but it finally happened.

17:19.415 --> 17:20.541
Where's our money?

17:20.624 --> 17:22.000
That's the best part.

17:22.084 --> 17:25.587
It's on the Batman flash drive
on your key chain.

17:25.713 --> 17:27.715
You've had it
in your pocket all along.

17:31.093 --> 17:32.845
Sheldon,

17:33.470 --> 17:35.889
I lost that key chain years ago.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.854
Really?

17:43.272 --> 17:46.066
Did you look under things?

17:49.361 --> 17:51.697
Well, that is unfortunate.

17:52.030 --> 17:54.533
I guess we've all learned
a lesson today.

17:57.244 --> 17:59.163
- What was the lesson?
- I don't know.

18:09.631 --> 18:12.259
<i>Huh. What's that?</i>

18:13.093 --> 18:16.388
<i>Ooh. Batman flash drive.</i>

18:17.473 --> 18:19.641
<i>It's pretty cool.</i>

18:20.559 --> 18:22.436
<i>Huh, if I erase this,</i>

18:22.519 --> 18:25.689
<i>I could probably resell it
for, like, 10 bucks.</i>

18:27.274 --> 18:28.859
<i>Things are finally going my way.</i>

18:55.344 --> 18:56.762
English - SDH
