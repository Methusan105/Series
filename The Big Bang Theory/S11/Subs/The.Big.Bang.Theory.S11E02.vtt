WEBVTT

00:04.339 --> 00:06.216
One dumpling left. Who wants it?

00:07.133 --> 00:08.760
Maybe you should offer it
to the pregnant lady.

00:10.387 --> 00:11.930
And that would be?

00:15.100 --> 00:17.018
Me, Sheldon, I'm obviously pregnant.

00:17.435 --> 00:19.062
Well, you never said it to my face,

00:19.354 --> 00:22.440
and the last time I assumed a woman
was pregnant, it did not go over well.

00:22.941 --> 00:24.067
Yeah, I'm still mad at you.

00:26.569 --> 00:28.530
You were drinking water instead of wine,

00:28.613 --> 00:29.656
what was I supposed to think?

00:31.366 --> 00:34.035
Sheldon's right. I would never ask
a woman if she was pregnant

00:34.119 --> 00:38.331
unless she tells me, or I see
a human being wiggling out of her.

00:40.792 --> 00:42.127
Well, Sheldon, I'm pregnant.

00:42.293 --> 00:44.379
Congratulations! How far along are you?

00:44.713 --> 00:45.714
About three months.

00:46.005 --> 00:47.298
Only three?

00:49.134 --> 00:51.052
Good gravy,
how many babies are in there?

00:53.388 --> 00:56.850
Okay, let's talk about something
that won't infuriate my pregnant wife.

00:58.518 --> 01:00.478
I read an interesting fact
about elephants.

01:00.603 --> 01:01.604
Try again.

01:03.982 --> 01:07.152
Oh, I've got something. I'm being
interviewed on public radio this Friday.

01:07.610 --> 01:08.611
Oh, cool. How come?

01:08.695 --> 01:11.364
The university's trying to get
more funding for the physics department,

01:11.489 --> 01:13.032
so they want me to go out
and talk it up.

01:13.491 --> 01:14.576
Really, you?

01:18.246 --> 01:20.248
Well, they picked the right person
for the job.

01:21.708 --> 01:22.792
Thank you.

01:23.209 --> 01:24.210
I think he bought it.

01:52.906 --> 01:55.450
Hi, I'm Ira Flatow,
and this is <i>Science Friday.</i>

01:55.533 --> 01:59.120
Joining me today is my guest physicist
Doctor Leonard Hofstadter,

01:59.412 --> 02:02.832
to talk about all of the exciting
research they're doing at Caltech.

02:03.082 --> 02:05.418
Thank you for having me. Whoa.

02:05.752 --> 02:07.670
I never get used to hearing
myself in headphones.

02:07.754 --> 02:08.755
Is that really how I sound?

02:10.381 --> 02:11.382
It is, it is.

02:12.008 --> 02:13.176
That is good to know.

02:15.261 --> 02:17.514
I told him his voice was annoying,
he didn't wanna listen.

02:18.723 --> 02:19.724
Hey!

02:19.974 --> 02:21.184
What, you're saying it's not?

02:21.893 --> 02:23.686
Just, hey.

02:25.230 --> 02:28.399
So it has been five years
since the discovery of the Higgs boson.

02:28.650 --> 02:30.610
What's the next big thing gonna be?

02:30.944 --> 02:33.571
Wow, that's hard to say,
there's so much going on.

02:33.738 --> 02:35.448
We've been collecting tons of data

02:35.532 --> 02:37.951
that could revolutionize
the way we understand the universe.

02:38.493 --> 02:40.870
Uh, for instance,
there's a particle called a squark,

02:41.204 --> 02:42.747
which could prove supersymmetry!

02:43.039 --> 02:44.457
That is interesting. Have you found it?

02:44.749 --> 02:45.875
- What, the squark?
- Yes.

02:46.042 --> 02:47.043
No, no.

02:48.878 --> 02:50.630
Wouldn't that be exciting?

02:51.714 --> 02:53.758
But we're also looking for
the selectron,

02:53.842 --> 02:54.884
the gluino, and the neutralino.

02:55.134 --> 02:56.427
- And have you found that?
- No.

02:58.555 --> 02:59.889
But, uh, fun side note,

02:59.973 --> 03:02.433
I went to high school
with a girl named Theresa Gluino.

03:02.684 --> 03:05.228
But it didn't cost
two billion dollars to find her.

03:05.311 --> 03:07.772
She was smoking behind the gym.

03:09.566 --> 03:10.859
So, what have you found?

03:11.025 --> 03:12.026
Um, nothing actually.

03:12.610 --> 03:13.736
Should he be saying that?

03:14.487 --> 03:15.488
Probably not.

03:15.822 --> 03:17.574
Yeah, this is public radio.

03:17.824 --> 03:20.159
Doesn't he realize
dozens of people might hear him?

03:22.620 --> 03:24.122
But, I remain confident.

03:24.539 --> 03:27.792
We've got the best equipment,
and the best minds all working on it.

03:28.209 --> 03:29.878
Okay, sounds like he's back on track.

03:30.211 --> 03:32.463
Although, some days I'm like,

03:32.714 --> 03:34.507
"Ugh, we've spent so much money.

03:34.674 --> 03:37.510
Why haven't we found anything?
What are we doing?"

03:42.432 --> 03:43.433
Oh, boy.

03:47.604 --> 03:50.231
There's Leonard. I bet he's having
a rough day.

03:50.607 --> 03:51.816
Let's just try to be supportive.

03:52.358 --> 03:53.443
Supportive?

03:53.526 --> 03:56.404
He publicly maligned
the love of my life, Lady Physics.

03:58.114 --> 04:00.283
Might not want to mention that
to Lady FiancÃ©e.

04:02.702 --> 04:03.703
Hey, guys.

04:03.786 --> 04:04.787
- Hey.
- Hey. How's it goin'?

04:05.163 --> 04:06.497
Pff.

04:08.207 --> 04:09.751
What? You got something to say?

04:10.335 --> 04:12.003
I think I just said it.

04:13.379 --> 04:14.547
P.F.F.

04:16.466 --> 04:17.634
Pff.

04:19.844 --> 04:22.472
- I...
- Look, I, I was just speaking the truth.

04:22.555 --> 04:25.016
Yeah, we're scientists,
isn't that what we're supposed to do?

04:25.183 --> 04:26.768
Oh, what would you know about the truth?

04:26.851 --> 04:29.062
You thought <i>Phantom Menace</i>
was "not half bad."

04:31.397 --> 04:32.774
I told you that in confidence!

04:34.150 --> 04:37.028
Okay, calm down, everybody.
Just cool it.

04:37.445 --> 04:40.073
No, let 'em go. If we get lucky,
maybe one of them'll start crying.

04:41.741 --> 04:44.410
Can we just drop this
and have lunch like adults?

04:45.036 --> 04:46.120
- Sure.
- Very well.

04:48.998 --> 04:49.999
- Leonard?
- What?

04:50.291 --> 04:51.542
Pff.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.590
- You ready for lunch?
- Oh, one second.

04:58.675 --> 05:01.678
Ooh, someone's got a lot of
fancy new lab equipment.

05:01.761 --> 05:04.847
I know. The university's been
throwing money at my study.

05:05.223 --> 05:07.392
With any luck, there'll be
a brain disease with my name on it.

05:08.893 --> 05:09.894
Fingers crossed.

05:10.269 --> 05:12.981
Which is ironic,
because if you had Fowler's Palsy,

05:13.064 --> 05:14.565
you wouldn't be able
to cross your fingers.

05:17.026 --> 05:19.904
I'm surprised Sheldon's not up here
playing with all your new toys.

05:20.363 --> 05:21.906
Actually, I haven't told him about it.

05:22.281 --> 05:24.033
We've been getting so much more funding
than physics,

05:24.117 --> 05:25.493
he's been a little sensitive.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.121
So you're just gonna
hide your success from him?

05:28.413 --> 05:30.999
I know, am I terrible?

05:31.416 --> 05:33.459
No, I do that too!

05:35.378 --> 05:37.630
Howie thought
my company retreat was in Boise.

05:37.922 --> 05:39.298
It was in Tahiti.

05:41.092 --> 05:42.093
That's such a relief.

05:42.176 --> 05:44.804
I mean, part of me was worried
I was being unfair to Sheldon.

05:45.096 --> 05:47.015
Take that part of yourself
and hide it away.

05:47.432 --> 05:50.268
Just like I did with last year's
bonus check that I "didn't get."

05:56.315 --> 05:59.485
- Ms. Davis, you wanted to see me?
- Yes, Doctor Hofstadter, come on in.

06:00.611 --> 06:01.821
Should I sit or stand?

06:02.113 --> 06:04.032
I'm not used to being called
into the Dean's office.

06:04.323 --> 06:05.408
Please sit.

06:06.743 --> 06:08.286
I have to say, I'm a little nervous.

06:08.578 --> 06:09.787
You should be.

06:11.873 --> 06:13.166
Look, I know I screwed up.

06:13.249 --> 06:15.126
But it was only one interview.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.086
How much damage could it have caused?

06:17.462 --> 06:19.547
Would you like for me
to read you the emails

06:19.630 --> 06:21.924
from donors asking
why are they giving us money

06:22.008 --> 06:23.634
if physics is a dead end?

06:23.885 --> 06:25.386
I didn't say it was a dead end.

06:25.470 --> 06:27.388
I just said that
I was worried it might be.

06:28.389 --> 06:31.893
So, if I just said I was worried
you might not have a job next week,

06:32.101 --> 06:33.102
how would you feel?

06:35.646 --> 06:37.523
Light-headed
and glad you asked me to sit down.

06:39.233 --> 06:40.860
Okay, just tell me what I can do.

06:41.402 --> 06:44.363
I'm gonna need you to make a statement
saying that you misspoke,

06:44.530 --> 06:46.574
and that you're confident
the physics community

06:46.657 --> 06:47.992
is close to a major breakthrough.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.244
You want me to lie?

06:51.621 --> 06:54.373
Look, Doctor Hofstadter,
I'm counting on you.

06:54.874 --> 06:58.503
I think that you are the
smartest physicist at this university.

06:59.921 --> 07:03.091
- Really?
- See? Lies. They're not that hard.

07:10.556 --> 07:12.016
- Hi.
- Hello.

07:12.850 --> 07:13.935
Oh.

07:14.102 --> 07:15.186
Looks like you've been busy.

07:15.561 --> 07:16.854
Oh, I have.

07:16.979 --> 07:20.900
Dark matter, reconciling
gravity and quantum mechanics,

07:21.317 --> 07:22.318
supersymmetry.

07:22.401 --> 07:25.363
I figured out
the biggest problems in physics today.

07:25.947 --> 07:27.657
Wow, you solved them all?

07:28.324 --> 07:30.701
No, I just... I figured out
that they're the biggest problems.

07:33.204 --> 07:35.248
Is this about what Leonard said
on the radio?

07:35.331 --> 07:36.707
Uh, absolutely not.

07:36.958 --> 07:38.543
And I do not want to talk about Leonard.

07:38.626 --> 07:40.128
Can we please
just talk about anything else?

07:40.878 --> 07:42.088
We could talk about my day.

07:42.338 --> 07:43.840
Walked right into that one, didn't I?

07:46.259 --> 07:48.094
Well, since you sort of asked,

07:48.386 --> 07:49.679
I actually had a very good day.

07:49.804 --> 07:51.347
I got some new equipment for my lab.

07:53.307 --> 07:54.851
Well, congratulations.

07:55.351 --> 07:57.812
I got some new equipment, too.

07:58.396 --> 07:59.939
I got these markers.

08:01.482 --> 08:02.775
They smell like fruit,

08:03.276 --> 08:04.986
which I did not notice
when I bought them.

08:05.611 --> 08:06.904
Don't really care for it.

08:10.241 --> 08:11.993
Here, drink this.

08:12.952 --> 08:14.036
It might help.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.622
- What if it doesn't?
- No, that's why I brought the bottle.

08:19.417 --> 08:22.295
No one would talk to me in the halls,
they just glared at me.

08:22.545 --> 08:24.088
It's like high school all over again.

08:25.047 --> 08:27.800
Oh, I would totally do high school
all over again.

08:31.137 --> 08:32.346
But that doesn't help you.

08:35.016 --> 08:37.143
I got called into
the administration office.

08:37.560 --> 08:40.438
Ooh, look at my bad boy
getting called to the principal.

08:41.814 --> 08:43.441
We don't technically have a principal,

08:43.524 --> 08:45.610
there's a standing committee
that oversees the budget.

08:45.985 --> 08:48.863
Ooh, look at my bad boy
answering questions nobody asked.

08:50.907 --> 08:52.867
Oh, come on, look, you said
a few dumb things on the radio.

08:53.075 --> 08:54.327
What is the worst that could happen?

08:55.536 --> 08:56.746
I may get fired.

08:58.456 --> 09:00.499
Okay, well, even if you did,
you could find another job.

09:00.791 --> 09:03.419
Yeah, who wouldn't
wanna hire the physicist

09:03.502 --> 09:05.338
who publicly said physics is dead.

09:05.922 --> 09:08.007
Well, I wouldn't put that
under special skills.

09:09.926 --> 09:13.346
Look, I can fix it. I just need to
write a retraction I don't believe in.

09:13.429 --> 09:15.556
Basically sell out to keep my job.

09:16.682 --> 09:17.683
Great, I'll leave you to it.

09:22.939 --> 09:24.398
Hmm.

09:30.905 --> 09:32.198
Hmm.

09:38.162 --> 09:39.330
Oy.

09:42.041 --> 09:43.167
<i>Sheldon, it's me.</i>

09:46.921 --> 09:48.339
- What?
- Look, I know you're mad,

09:48.464 --> 09:49.674
but I have to write a statement

09:49.757 --> 09:51.592
that says the physics community
is close to a breakthrough.

09:52.009 --> 09:54.762
And since you actually believe that,
I could really use your help.

09:55.221 --> 09:57.515
- Sorry, I can't.
- Come on, don't be like that.

09:57.807 --> 10:00.101
I can't, because I think you were right.

10:01.269 --> 10:02.979
- What?
- Look,

10:04.313 --> 10:05.523
not all science pans out.

10:06.190 --> 10:09.151
You know, we've been hoping
supersymmetry was true for decades,

10:09.277 --> 10:11.946
and finally we built
the Large Hadron Collider,

10:12.029 --> 10:14.407
which is supposed to prove it
by finding these new particles,

10:14.490 --> 10:15.574
but it hasn't.

10:15.783 --> 10:19.161
Maybe supersymmetry,
our last big idea, is simply wrong.

10:21.080 --> 10:22.290
That sounds awful.

10:24.166 --> 10:25.710
Now I get why everyone hates me.

10:27.586 --> 10:28.713
On the bright side,

10:28.838 --> 10:30.673
after working together for 15 years,

10:30.756 --> 10:32.758
you finally get to hear me say
you were right.

10:36.012 --> 10:37.263
Yeah, you did.

10:38.764 --> 10:39.849
How's it feel?

10:41.058 --> 10:42.768
Given I might be unemployed,
bittersweet.

10:49.442 --> 10:50.526
Read it back to me.

10:50.651 --> 10:51.652
Hang on.

10:51.777 --> 10:54.655
"Yes, one might question
the 20 billion dollars

10:54.739 --> 10:56.490
"to build and run
the Large Hadron Collider,

10:56.615 --> 10:58.117
"but on the other hand..."

11:03.998 --> 11:05.207
Okay, um...

11:05.541 --> 11:08.836
Oh, oh! On the other hand,
contrary to predictions,

11:09.003 --> 11:11.922
the Collider didn't create
a small black hole

11:12.048 --> 11:13.883
that devoured the Earth
and life as we know it.

11:14.091 --> 11:16.135
So, money well spent.

11:20.139 --> 11:21.265
This is depressing.

11:21.432 --> 11:22.850
Do you have any alcohol around here?

11:23.225 --> 11:26.479
Oh, not surprisingly, when Penny
moved out, she took every last drop.

11:27.688 --> 11:31.067
Oh, but I do have several bottles
of Romulan Ale

11:31.150 --> 11:32.651
that I bought at Comic-Con.

11:35.529 --> 11:37.573
Isn't that just vodka
with blue dye in it?

11:37.907 --> 11:39.575
First physics, now Romulan Ale.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.202
What else would you like to defecate on?

11:44.288 --> 11:45.706
Hey, I thought you were
coming right back.

11:45.831 --> 11:47.625
I was, but we're both depressed

11:47.792 --> 11:49.418
and decided to drown our sorrows.

11:50.669 --> 11:51.712
In mouthwash?

11:54.757 --> 11:56.425
Man, that is so summer camp.

11:58.052 --> 12:00.471
It's Romulan Ale from <i>Star Trek.</i>

12:00.846 --> 12:02.848
It was briefly legalized
during the alliance

12:02.932 --> 12:04.100
between the Romulan Empire

12:04.183 --> 12:06.143
and the Federation at the time
of the Dominion War.

12:07.228 --> 12:08.354
Aw, now I'm depressed.

12:11.982 --> 12:14.443
The more I told him about my lab,
the pissier he got.

12:14.777 --> 12:15.778
You know what he said to me?

12:16.195 --> 12:19.323
He said, "I hope all your correlations
turn out to be specious."

12:21.700 --> 12:23.160
He said that to your face?

12:23.494 --> 12:24.495
What a dick.

12:28.165 --> 12:30.042
You know, you're a successful woman,

12:30.126 --> 12:32.837
you should be able to brag about
your accomplishments once in a while.

12:33.379 --> 12:34.588
And so should you.

12:34.672 --> 12:36.382
I mean, the guys are never shy
about bragging.

12:36.715 --> 12:37.758
Tell me about it.

12:37.842 --> 12:41.095
Howie texts me every time
his dog levels up in <i>Warcraft.</i>

12:43.180 --> 12:46.058
Has he ever called you to tell you
he found three peanuts in one shell?

12:46.183 --> 12:47.601
'Cause Sheldon has.

12:49.186 --> 12:50.771
We should be able to do that, too.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.232
I guess we can brag to each other.

12:53.941 --> 12:54.984
That's a great idea.

12:55.234 --> 12:56.861
Damn right it is. I came up with it.

13:00.531 --> 13:02.032
That felt good!

13:05.786 --> 13:07.746
You know, there's so much money
in pharmaceuticals,

13:07.830 --> 13:09.582
we don't even wash out our test tubes.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.084
We just throw 'em out and get new ones.

13:13.961 --> 13:17.173
I just got a brand-new,
state-of-the-art FMRI machine.

13:17.423 --> 13:19.884
- Those things are so expensive.
- I know.

13:20.426 --> 13:22.636
Sometimes I just lie down in there
and take a nap.

13:25.222 --> 13:26.765
It's like a million dollar bunk bed.

13:29.393 --> 13:31.395
At the office, I have two assistants.

13:31.604 --> 13:34.106
I don't even know their names.
I just call 'em Thing One and Thing Two.

13:37.067 --> 13:38.527
That's great. I don't have assistants.

13:39.695 --> 13:42.239
I guess that's one of the benefits
of being in the private sector.

13:42.781 --> 13:44.325
That and all the money I make.

13:45.743 --> 13:47.203
Yeah, you've got that.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.997
I've got my integrity,
hard to say which is better

13:50.080 --> 13:51.207
without making you feel bad.

13:55.419 --> 13:57.004
Okay, so you guys are upset

13:57.087 --> 13:59.757
because the Collider thing
disproved your theories?

14:00.090 --> 14:01.133
I-it's worse than that.

14:01.300 --> 14:02.885
It hasn't found anything in years,

14:02.968 --> 14:04.970
so we don't know if we're right,
we don't know if we're wrong,

14:05.054 --> 14:06.347
we don't know where to go next.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.850
All I know is it looks like
I tongue-kissed <i>Avatar.</i>

14:12.728 --> 14:15.147
Come on, you guys are physicists, okay?

14:15.231 --> 14:16.982
You're always gonna be physicists,

14:17.066 --> 14:19.527
and sure, sometimes the physics is hard.

14:19.818 --> 14:22.238
But isn't that what makes it boring?

14:24.990 --> 14:26.242
<i>- Hey.</i>
- We're here.

14:26.534 --> 14:28.869
<i>- What's going on?</i>
- Okay. As far as I can see,

14:29.328 --> 14:31.372
science is dead
'cause Leonard killed it.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.958
And I don't know who the Romulans are,

14:34.041 --> 14:35.251
but those guys know how to party.

14:37.294 --> 14:38.295
So, what do you want us to do?

14:38.462 --> 14:40.047
I don't know. You're scientists,
cheer them up!

14:40.673 --> 14:43.467
Cheer them up?
Do you even know what a scientist is?

14:45.511 --> 14:47.388
No, we don't need to be cheered up.

14:47.471 --> 14:50.099
It just turns out that
physics is exactly like <i>Lost.</i>

14:50.266 --> 14:52.768
Started out great, and turns out
just a big ol' waste of time.

14:54.895 --> 14:57.314
Boo-hoo. You know what
you sound like? Babies.

14:57.606 --> 14:59.441
Two whiny babies.

14:59.858 --> 15:02.903
There's nothing worse than
being stuck with two whiny babies!

15:05.489 --> 15:06.657
Oh.

15:18.669 --> 15:20.337
Oh, my God. I'm gonna have two babies.

15:20.838 --> 15:23.257
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.
Babies are great.

15:23.340 --> 15:24.550
You're lucky to have two babies.

15:24.800 --> 15:28.012
I mean look at me, uh, I'm all alone.
I'm never gonna have babies

15:28.137 --> 15:31.724
'cause you can't make a baby
watching Netflix with your dog.

15:37.521 --> 15:38.647
Thanks for coming.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.694
I may not make as much money as you,

15:43.777 --> 15:45.487
but at least I know that
I'm actually doing something

15:45.571 --> 15:47.072
that makes people's lives better.

15:47.781 --> 15:50.075
Hey, my work makes
people's lives better,

15:50.534 --> 15:52.911
especially if you have moderate
to severe eczema

15:52.995 --> 15:54.413
and don't mind a few loose teeth.

15:56.790 --> 15:59.335
You're right, we both do important work.

15:59.501 --> 16:01.295
I'm trying to map the structures
of the brain,

16:01.378 --> 16:04.548
and you're trying to convince people
that itchy hair is a real thing.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.760
It is a real thing!

16:08.052 --> 16:11.221
It happens to be a side effect
of our cholesterol drug.

16:13.599 --> 16:17.645
I'm just saying that my research
may actually change the world forever.

16:18.187 --> 16:19.480
I hope it does,

16:19.605 --> 16:21.690
'cause I'm gonna see that world
from a yacht so big

16:21.774 --> 16:23.442
you can land a helicopter on it.

16:30.199 --> 16:32.034
Physics is all we're cut out for.

16:32.826 --> 16:35.537
I mean, if we weren't physicists,
what would we be?

16:36.372 --> 16:38.582
I don't know, popular?

16:39.208 --> 16:40.459
Mm-hmm.

16:40.542 --> 16:43.796
It's fine, I don't need to be
a theoretical physicist.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.340
There's lots of things
I could use this brain for.

16:46.799 --> 16:49.760
I could be an accountant for the mob.

16:51.845 --> 16:54.348
I could guess people's weight
at the fair.

16:56.225 --> 16:57.685
Okay, this is getting silly.

16:58.185 --> 16:59.186
Is it?

16:59.812 --> 17:00.813
One-eighty.

17:04.358 --> 17:06.276
Okay, that is enough!

17:06.568 --> 17:08.195
Your lives are not wasted,

17:08.278 --> 17:09.905
your careers are not at a dead end.

17:09.988 --> 17:11.615
You just hit a rough patch.

17:11.824 --> 17:14.743
Instead of feeling sorry for yourselves,
you need to get up and get inspired.

17:15.035 --> 17:16.620
- How?
- I don't know!

17:16.745 --> 17:18.414
You know, when I'm feeling down,
I go for a run.

17:18.539 --> 17:21.375
Which is exactly why I'm not
180 pounds, genius!

17:23.919 --> 17:25.045
I know where we need to go.

17:25.587 --> 17:28.257
Um, are we running there?
Because watching drunk Sheldon run

17:28.340 --> 17:29.675
would be the highlight of my life.

17:31.593 --> 17:33.053
We're going to see Richard Feynman.

17:33.804 --> 17:35.806
Penny, Richard Feynman
is an iconic physicist...

17:35.889 --> 17:38.976
I know who he is. Leonard dressed as him
for Halloween last year.

17:43.856 --> 17:46.108
I had no idea Richard Feynman was dead.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.818
Yeah, most people don't know

17:47.901 --> 17:50.946
he's actually buried
right here in Altadena.

17:51.363 --> 17:54.575
I'm sure they keep a lid on that
to avoid traffic jams.

17:57.411 --> 17:59.413
Well, here he is.

17:59.621 --> 18:01.623
Oh, wow, he's buried with his wife.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.626
We get it, a lady loved you.
Quit bragging!

18:07.087 --> 18:08.547
Feynman was so cool.

18:09.256 --> 18:11.925
When I was a kid,
I'd put on some headphones

18:12.259 --> 18:14.178
and crank up one of his lectures

18:15.304 --> 18:16.472
and just jam out to knowledge.

18:18.557 --> 18:19.933
This guy knew how to live.

18:20.476 --> 18:22.561
Taught himself musical instruments,

18:22.853 --> 18:26.106
studied Portuguese
just to give a speech in Brazil.

18:26.607 --> 18:29.651
The only part of me
that's been to Brazil is my bikini line.

18:31.153 --> 18:32.154
Okay.

18:34.782 --> 18:36.116
He did so much,

18:36.658 --> 18:39.286
and here we are stuck
and letting him down.

18:40.037 --> 18:42.706
You know, Feynman used to say
he didn't do physics

18:42.790 --> 18:44.792
for the glory or the awards,

18:45.584 --> 18:46.794
but just for the fun of it.

18:48.545 --> 18:49.671
He's right.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.634
Physics is only dead
when we stop being excited about it.

18:55.052 --> 18:57.930
Even beyond the grave,
he's imparting wisdom.

18:58.430 --> 19:00.557
Um, I'm the one who remembered it.

19:03.101 --> 19:05.062
Give me the bottle.
It might be a little corny,

19:05.145 --> 19:06.855
but I say we pour one out

19:06.939 --> 19:10.192
for all the science homies
who came before us.

19:10.359 --> 19:11.652
- I love that.
<i>- Do it.</i>

19:17.825 --> 19:18.826
Here comes some more!

19:24.039 --> 19:25.207
Ah, we got to see him run.

19:33.465 --> 19:34.508
Hi. You wanted to see me?

19:34.758 --> 19:38.011
Yes, I wanted to talk to you about
the email you sent me last night.

19:39.096 --> 19:40.180
I sent you an email?

19:42.224 --> 19:43.559
You bet you did.

19:45.602 --> 19:49.731
"Hello, <i>shalom</i> and <i>aloha</i>
from the grave of Richard Feynman."

19:50.148 --> 19:52.109
Oh, it's coming back to me.

19:53.068 --> 19:55.195
"Please accept the following retraction,

19:55.571 --> 19:57.489
"I know I said physics is dead,

19:57.656 --> 19:59.324
"but it is the opposite of dead.

19:59.700 --> 20:02.828
"If anything, it is undead,
like a zombie.

20:04.580 --> 20:07.624
"Speaking of which, if Richard Feynman
came back as a zombie,

20:07.916 --> 20:09.668
"I would totally let him bite me."

20:12.379 --> 20:13.672
Any chance that's the end?

20:15.173 --> 20:16.800
"I got bit by a squirrel once.

20:18.510 --> 20:20.178
"I had to get rabies shots.

20:20.512 --> 20:24.349
"I cried so much,
my mother said, 'Don't be a baby.'

20:24.766 --> 20:27.144
"In conclusion, physics is great,

20:27.519 --> 20:29.354
"squirrels suck and someday,

20:29.563 --> 20:31.899
"I'm gonna put my mom
in a cheap nursing home.

20:34.026 --> 20:37.738
"Yours truly, XOXO,
Doctor Leonard Hofstadter."

20:38.447 --> 20:39.531
I can explain. I...

20:39.781 --> 20:41.033
"P.S.

20:41.992 --> 20:43.535
"Can you come pick us up?

20:43.660 --> 20:45.579
"The Uber driver won't open the door

20:45.662 --> 20:48.540
"because Sheldon is covered
in blue vomit."
