WEBVTT

00:03.630 --> 00:04.756
This was a good idea.

00:04.839 --> 00:06.716
It's been a long time
since we've had girls' night.

00:06.883 --> 00:08.593
Yeah. It's so nice to
have a relaxing evening

00:08.677 --> 00:10.053
at home doing nothing.

00:10.303 --> 00:12.389
<i>Yeah, really breaks up
the other 30 days</i>

00:12.472 --> 00:14.683
<i>I've spent on bed rest
doing nothing.</i>

00:16.142 --> 00:18.353
Well, tonight we're gonna
make you forget all that.

00:18.436 --> 00:20.397
<i>You're gonna make me forget
I've been stuck in bed</i>

00:20.480 --> 00:22.941
<i>while a baby uses my bladder
as a kickball?</i>

00:24.651 --> 00:26.903
Hey, you had unprotected sex
with Howard.

00:26.986 --> 00:28.822
You deserve to be miserable.

00:31.032 --> 00:32.867
Hey, I need some fashion advice.

00:32.951 --> 00:34.077
Really? From me?

00:34.160 --> 00:35.161
- I would love to...
- Actually, Leonard told me

00:35.245 --> 00:36.871
Penny was over here?

00:37.414 --> 00:38.957
Hey, what's going on?
You got a date?

00:39.040 --> 00:41.292
I do have a date, with science.

00:41.501 --> 00:43.753
Oh, what's science wearing?

00:45.338 --> 00:49.259
The Griffith Observatory is
looking for an astrophysicist to consult

00:49.342 --> 00:50.635
and I have an interview tomorrow.

00:50.719 --> 00:52.345
Oh, I love the observatory.

00:52.429 --> 00:54.764
They tell you your weight
on all the different planets.

00:54.848 --> 00:57.392
Yeah. It's always
bikini season on Venus.

00:58.727 --> 01:00.228
I think you'd be great at that.

01:00.311 --> 01:01.730
Don't you agree, Bernadette?

01:02.230 --> 01:04.023
<i>Huh? I'm listening. I'm listening.</i>

01:04.107 --> 01:06.109
<i>I'm not watching</i> The Crown.

01:06.860 --> 01:08.737
I just want to make
a good first impression,

01:08.820 --> 01:10.822
and thought maybe you could
help me pick out an outfit.

01:10.905 --> 01:12.657
Of course. Let's see what you got.

01:12.782 --> 01:14.200
Yeah, you just need
to pick something

01:14.284 --> 01:15.702
that you feel confident in.

01:15.785 --> 01:18.204
I'm sorry.
I left my magic clothes at home.

01:18.621 --> 01:21.040
I'm sure these two options will be...

01:23.209 --> 01:26.212
So you have other clothes at home?

01:26.504 --> 01:28.798
It doesn't matter.
They're talking to a bunch of people.

01:28.882 --> 01:30.049
I probably won't get it anyway.

01:30.133 --> 01:31.176
Well, don't say that.

01:31.384 --> 01:33.344
Yeah, you have to believe in yourself.

01:33.553 --> 01:34.846
You know,
before I came to America,

01:34.929 --> 01:36.347
I was filled with confidence.

01:36.431 --> 01:37.474
What happened to me?

01:37.557 --> 01:39.934
<i>Hey, is that Raj there
at girls' night?</i>

01:40.059 --> 01:41.728
Oh, hey. Hey, Howard.

01:41.811 --> 01:43.813
<i>Just remember,
if you fall asleep first,</i>

01:43.897 --> 01:45.899
<i>they're gonna freeze your bra.</i>

02:14.093 --> 02:16.095
You and Amy having fun
planning your wedding?

02:16.513 --> 02:20.725
We're employing a mathematical approach
called decision theory,

02:20.809 --> 02:22.435
so, heck, yeah.

02:24.062 --> 02:25.355
"Heck, yeah"?

02:25.438 --> 02:28.608
Looks like someone needs to put a dollar
in the almost-swear jar.

02:29.776 --> 02:32.445
We've assigned all wedding
decisions randomly,

02:32.529 --> 02:34.239
and each of us makes half of them.

02:34.322 --> 02:36.533
From venue to officiant

02:36.616 --> 02:40.620
to numbering system for the tables,
Roman or Dewey Decimal.

02:41.663 --> 02:43.414
Why not hexadecimal?

02:45.875 --> 02:48.461
'Cause this is our wedding, not a joke.

02:49.295 --> 02:50.421
Hey, guys.

02:50.505 --> 02:51.798
- Hello.
- Hey.

02:51.881 --> 02:52.924
Oh, good. Raj is here

02:53.007 --> 02:55.426
to tell us today's specials.

02:55.510 --> 02:58.513
Very funny.
I have my interview this afternoon.

02:58.596 --> 03:01.307
Aw, if it doesn't work out, you're ready
to go on your Mormon mission.

03:03.560 --> 03:05.353
I don't understand what's going on here.

03:05.478 --> 03:08.314
Uh... What's going on here is
I'm up for a job at the planetarium,

03:08.398 --> 03:10.066
and Howard is making fun of me.

03:10.650 --> 03:13.444
Oh, it's great.
You're both doing what you love.

03:13.987 --> 03:15.363
Well, I'm excited for you.

03:15.446 --> 03:17.532
Oh. Thanks, yeah.
I'd be in charge of developing

03:17.615 --> 03:19.784
and narrating all
the planetarium shows.

03:19.868 --> 03:22.328
And I really want this, so it wouldn't
kill you to be more supportive.

03:22.412 --> 03:25.707
But if it did, you could bury me
at the funeral home you direct.

03:27.584 --> 03:30.753
Wait. The premise is that
he is dressed differently?

03:30.879 --> 03:32.505
Yeah.

03:33.214 --> 03:36.092
That's true.
He is not dressed the same.

03:41.222 --> 03:43.224
- Hey, Dad.
<i>- Hello, Rajesh.</i>

03:43.308 --> 03:44.434
<i>How was the interview?</i>

03:44.517 --> 03:45.852
Not so great.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.437
They asked me
what my biggest weakness was,

03:47.520 --> 03:50.523
and 45 minutes later,
they thanked me for coming.

03:50.940 --> 03:55.111
<i>Son, don't take this the wrong way,
but what's your problem?</i>

03:55.820 --> 03:59.115
I would tell you, but apparently
it takes 45 minutes.

03:59.824 --> 04:00.992
<i>You know what?</i>

04:01.117 --> 04:03.411
<i>I bet it's those friends
you surround yourself with.</i>

04:03.494 --> 04:05.997
<i>Like that Howard,
always making fun of you.</i>

04:06.080 --> 04:08.416
Howard doesn't mean anything by it.

04:08.499 --> 04:09.876
<i>I think it's cultural.</i>

04:09.959 --> 04:11.878
His people come
from a very sarcastic village

04:11.961 --> 04:13.838
called Brooklyn.

04:14.923 --> 04:16.674
<i>Don't make excuses.</i>

04:16.758 --> 04:18.801
<i>What kind of friend acts that way?</i>

04:19.344 --> 04:21.721
- Well, I guess...
<i>- It was a rhetorical question.</i>

04:21.804 --> 04:23.681
<i>A bad friend!</i>

04:23.932 --> 04:26.559
Come on, Dad!
That's just our relationship, okay?

04:26.643 --> 04:28.603
He makes Indian jokes,
and I laugh,

04:28.686 --> 04:32.148
but, you know, with angry eyes,
so he knows it's not okay.

04:32.774 --> 04:34.651
<i>I, too, was in a relationship</i>

04:34.734 --> 04:37.737
<i>with someone who made me
feel bad about myself.</i>

04:37.862 --> 04:40.031
If you're talking about Mom,
I don't want to hear it.

04:40.156 --> 04:42.825
<i>I'm just saying,
if you replace Howard</i>

04:42.909 --> 04:45.578
<i>with a nice 22-year-old
grad student,</i>

04:45.662 --> 04:48.456
<i>your self-confidence will soar.</i>

04:51.960 --> 04:54.170
All right, Amy, you're up.

04:54.295 --> 04:55.964
Next decision.

04:56.422 --> 04:57.966
Come on, first dance!

04:58.049 --> 04:59.592
Come on, first dance!

05:01.928 --> 05:03.221
- Oh!
- Invitations!

05:03.304 --> 05:04.472
That's a good one.

05:04.555 --> 05:05.807
Just a suggestion,

05:05.890 --> 05:08.601
hologram projected out of R2-D2.

05:10.311 --> 05:13.064
Thanks for your input,
but this is my decision,

05:13.147 --> 05:15.108
and I'm gonna go with...

05:15.566 --> 05:18.486
Old English calligraphy
on Egyptian papyrus.

05:18.736 --> 05:20.530
What a fun mashup.

05:20.613 --> 05:23.741
It's like the chicken
and waffles of orthography.

05:25.034 --> 05:26.411
Your turn.

05:30.790 --> 05:34.502
Ring bearer! Boy, I'm so glad
that R2-D2 is still available.

05:36.170 --> 05:38.089
You know,
this is really fun.

05:38.214 --> 05:39.924
I can't believe that people say
that planning a wedding

05:40.008 --> 05:41.843
is one of the most
stressful things in life.

05:41.968 --> 05:44.637
I know. Not a day goes by
that I don't marvel

05:44.721 --> 05:46.931
how much better we are
than other people.

05:49.892 --> 05:51.644
I'm so sorry the interview
didn't go well.

05:51.728 --> 05:53.396
Yeah, you would've been perfect for it.

05:53.563 --> 05:54.939
I just get so nervous,

05:55.023 --> 05:57.442
and then I start apologizing
for being nervous, and...

05:57.859 --> 05:59.360
You guys don't want
to hear about this. I'm sorry.

05:59.444 --> 06:00.778
Stop apologizing!

06:00.862 --> 06:03.740
Oh, my God! You sound just like
the woman at the interview!

06:05.199 --> 06:06.576
Have you ever thought about talking

06:06.659 --> 06:08.494
to some kind of therapist
about all this?

06:08.619 --> 06:10.079
Maybe.

06:10.246 --> 06:12.290
Hey, Leonard, do you think
your mom would be available?

06:14.292 --> 06:16.210
Yeah, you don't want to do that.

06:17.879 --> 06:19.881
Talking to my mom to get more confidence

06:19.964 --> 06:23.384
is like talking to a lion
to get more alive.

06:24.427 --> 06:25.887
Well, my dad thinks

06:25.970 --> 06:28.306
it's because Howard's always
making fun of me.

06:28.598 --> 06:30.016
That makes sense.

06:30.099 --> 06:31.851
What do you mean,
that makes sense?

06:32.101 --> 06:34.062
Howard does make fun of him a lot.

06:34.145 --> 06:35.980
That's not all Howard's fault.

06:36.064 --> 06:38.775
I mean, if Raj doesn't want
to be made fun of, then I...

06:39.859 --> 06:42.612
I don't know a nice way
to finish this sentence.

06:43.196 --> 06:45.073
So you're on his side?

06:45.156 --> 06:46.908
I'm just saying,
that's what friends do.

06:46.991 --> 06:48.284
You know, they bust on each other.

06:48.367 --> 06:49.535
It doesn't mean anything.

06:49.619 --> 06:51.287
Well, I'm not surprised
you think so.

06:51.370 --> 06:52.455
Why is that?

06:52.538 --> 06:54.457
You can be kind of mean to me.

06:54.540 --> 06:56.626
Well, that's because you're...

06:58.377 --> 07:01.339
Wow. I don't know how
to finish that sentence, either.

07:01.589 --> 07:02.673
You know what?

07:02.757 --> 07:05.259
I think we're both done
being disrespected.

07:07.887 --> 07:10.056
I got a few rounds left in me.

07:10.389 --> 07:12.475
Attaboy, champ.

07:14.811 --> 07:18.064
Okay, let's see what
we've got so far.

07:18.314 --> 07:22.026
I arrive in a
<i>Little House on the Prairie</i>- style

07:22.110 --> 07:23.986
horse-drawn buggy.

07:24.195 --> 07:28.366
Where you are met with
an honor guard of stormtroopers.

07:30.284 --> 07:32.161
Do you think that might be jarring,

07:32.245 --> 07:35.581
going from wholesome pioneers
to space Nazis?

07:37.291 --> 07:38.584
I see what you're saying.

07:38.751 --> 07:40.795
You're thinking
that you should arrive

07:40.878 --> 07:44.090
in a replica
of Luke Skywalker's landspeeder.

07:45.967 --> 07:47.927
It's not what I'm thinking.

07:48.636 --> 07:51.097
And to save you
the trouble for the future,

07:51.180 --> 07:53.391
it will never be what I'm thinking.

07:54.851 --> 07:57.562
Well, if the ushers are
so important to you,

07:57.645 --> 07:58.938
what if I propose a trade?

07:59.021 --> 08:03.568
You may pick that, and I will decide,
say, first dance.

08:04.026 --> 08:08.072
Great. Then the ushers
will be my cousins

08:08.156 --> 08:10.783
dressed in frontier frock coats.

08:10.950 --> 08:15.204
And the first dance will be
that we won't have one.

08:16.622 --> 08:21.836
All right. Then our second dance
will be the first dance.

08:23.379 --> 08:25.214
Unless we have no dance at all. Ha-ha.

08:28.259 --> 08:30.344
Well, if we're changing things,

08:30.428 --> 08:33.764
then instead of throwing confetti,

08:33.848 --> 08:35.391
we'll release butterflies.

08:35.600 --> 08:38.269
Airborne worms?
Have you lost your mind?

08:39.020 --> 08:40.605
Well, if you're going to do that,

08:40.688 --> 08:43.024
then I am changing the officiant

08:43.107 --> 08:44.942
to that husky Spider-Man

08:45.026 --> 08:46.903
that hangs out at the Chinese Theater.

08:48.112 --> 08:51.365
Fine. Wedding toasts in Latin.

08:52.200 --> 08:55.244
Great. Vows in Klingon.

08:56.245 --> 08:59.040
Then I'm changing the
flower girl to a dog.

09:00.249 --> 09:03.002
And guess what he'll be
scattering instead of petals!

09:07.340 --> 09:08.841
Want to grab some lunch?

09:09.592 --> 09:11.719
You know what?
I don't think so.

09:12.261 --> 09:13.888
Well, let me guess.
You're not eating

09:13.971 --> 09:17.558
because the mean girls circled
your chubby bits in marker?

09:18.476 --> 09:20.978
No. That. That right there.
That's the reason.

09:21.062 --> 09:22.271
You're always making fun of me.

09:23.105 --> 09:24.941
Those are just jokes.

09:25.024 --> 09:27.443
It's my way of saying
that we're friends,

09:27.526 --> 09:30.571
and it wouldn't hurt
you to drop a few.

09:31.822 --> 09:34.742
See? No wonder
I don't have any confidence.

09:34.951 --> 09:36.953
Come on. You can't blame that on me.

09:37.036 --> 09:40.665
Why not? 15 years of constant ridicule.

09:40.748 --> 09:43.501
I think our relationship
has become toxic.

09:44.418 --> 09:46.254
What are you saying?

09:47.338 --> 09:49.882
I think you and I need to spend
some time away from each other.

09:52.134 --> 09:55.554
Look, I can see you're upset, but...

09:55.763 --> 09:59.350
I'm gonna need some ground rules.

09:59.558 --> 10:02.436
While we're apart,
can I see other needy Indian men?

10:02.561 --> 10:04.313
Get out!

10:11.279 --> 10:14.490
What do you think will make
the wedding worse for Amy,

10:14.949 --> 10:18.494
a cake made with salt
instead of sugar

10:19.537 --> 10:24.709
or a cake iced
with congealed gravy?

10:25.960 --> 10:27.336
Well, that is a trick question.

10:27.420 --> 10:29.797
The answer is,
you as the groom.

10:32.842 --> 10:34.802
Neither of them
will be the actual cake.

10:34.885 --> 10:36.721
I'm just using it
as a bargaining chip

10:36.804 --> 10:40.016
to get Amy to agree to the whole
wedding party getting rings

10:40.516 --> 10:44.520
and us getting one ring
to rule them all.

10:46.063 --> 10:49.900
I forget, which mental hospital
are you guys registered at?

10:50.860 --> 10:52.987
- Hello.
- Hello.

10:56.324 --> 10:58.868
Really? You're not gonna sit here?

10:59.035 --> 11:01.662
I'll sit there as soon as you leave.

11:02.204 --> 11:04.957
You're still on this?
I said sorry.

11:05.041 --> 11:08.544
Well, "sorry" doesn't make up
for years of emotional abuse.

11:09.128 --> 11:11.213
Well, what's it gonna take?

11:11.297 --> 11:13.466
You want half my sandwich?

11:16.218 --> 11:17.720
What is going on?

11:17.803 --> 11:21.474
Raj is trying to blame me
for his pathetic life.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.142
His life isn't pathetic.

11:23.225 --> 11:25.353
He's got that whole table
to himself.

11:27.730 --> 11:30.191
Well, one of us should go sit with Raj
so he's not alone.

11:30.274 --> 11:32.818
But I'm not done telling you
about my wedding revenge plans.

11:32.902 --> 11:34.195
You're right. Go on.

11:34.278 --> 11:35.613
Okay, well, first, I'm going to try

11:35.696 --> 11:38.157
to get Amy to trade with me
for hors d'oeuvres...

11:41.786 --> 11:43.454
Oh, good, you're here.

11:43.537 --> 11:46.082
I've decided on our centerpieces.

11:46.165 --> 11:49.335
I just hope your family
isn't allergic to asbestos.

11:50.336 --> 11:51.921
Sheldon, please stop.

11:52.213 --> 11:54.340
If we keep doing this,
we're gonna end up with a wedding

11:54.423 --> 11:56.759
that neither one of us will enjoy.

11:57.343 --> 11:59.387
Are you saying
you don't want to get married?

11:59.595 --> 12:01.305
No, of course I do.

12:01.389 --> 12:04.558
But that seems to be
the one thing we can agree on.

12:05.101 --> 12:07.978
Maybe we should just
get married at City Hall

12:08.062 --> 12:10.189
and forget about everything else.

12:11.357 --> 12:13.275
City Hall. Hmm.

12:14.443 --> 12:16.862
I do like metal detectors

12:17.822 --> 12:20.282
and the sound of permits being denied.

12:21.575 --> 12:22.660
Right.

12:22.743 --> 12:24.703
And if we're not enjoying
planning this wedding,

12:24.787 --> 12:26.288
then what's the point?

12:26.497 --> 12:29.166
Well, historically, a wedding
was to let other potential suitors know

12:29.250 --> 12:30.709
that we're unavailable.

12:30.876 --> 12:32.837
But I think matching T-shirts that say

12:32.920 --> 12:35.214
"Hands off the merchandise"
accomplish the same thing.

12:37.633 --> 12:41.053
So let's pick a day
and just go do it.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.266
How about tomorrow?

12:46.684 --> 12:47.768
Really?

12:47.852 --> 12:49.228
That soon?

12:49.395 --> 12:50.521
Why wait?

12:50.646 --> 12:52.690
I mean, it's not that I think
we're living in sin,

12:52.773 --> 12:55.276
but I do like the idea
that our next act of intimacy

12:55.359 --> 12:57.403
will be a legal requirement.

12:59.405 --> 13:02.616
Tomorrow, we'll go downtown
and get married.

13:02.700 --> 13:06.078
Or we could go to
Beverly Hills City Hall

13:06.162 --> 13:08.622
if you want a destination wedding.

13:13.127 --> 13:14.795
Hey. You look good today.

13:15.254 --> 13:17.006
What happened? What's wrong?

13:18.424 --> 13:20.217
Just tell me. I can take it.

13:20.718 --> 13:23.012
Nothing. I felt bad
about being mean to you,

13:23.095 --> 13:24.513
so I'm being nice.

13:24.972 --> 13:26.599
Oh, okay. Sorry. I wasn't ready for it.

13:26.682 --> 13:27.766
Try again?

13:27.975 --> 13:29.101
You look handsome.

13:29.393 --> 13:31.353
Nope, still freaking me out.

13:32.354 --> 13:34.148
- Hello, friends!
- Hey.

13:34.273 --> 13:35.649
Hey, what's going on with your hair?

13:35.774 --> 13:38.402
Nothing. I just decided
to stop straightening it.

13:38.527 --> 13:41.530
Wait, so you were making your hair
look like that on purpose?

13:42.990 --> 13:46.285
When I first moved to America,
I wanted to fit in.

13:46.368 --> 13:47.703
And Howard's hair was straight,

13:47.786 --> 13:48.954
and he was the coolest person I knew.

13:49.038 --> 13:51.373
Then you never saw any other people?

13:52.583 --> 13:54.335
You know what, I don't want
to talk about Howard.

13:54.418 --> 13:56.921
I came here to celebrate!

13:57.087 --> 13:59.298
Yeah. I went back
to the planetarium and told them

13:59.381 --> 14:02.176
they were making a huge mistake,
that I'd be perfect for the job.

14:02.259 --> 14:04.303
I was charming, I was confident.

14:04.386 --> 14:05.596
And they gave it to me.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.515
- That's amazing!
- Yeah, plus,

14:07.598 --> 14:08.599
it turns out the guy they hired

14:08.682 --> 14:11.101
got busted
at a sketchy massage parlor.

14:12.728 --> 14:14.396
So, happy ending for you!

14:14.522 --> 14:16.398
Oh, and for him.

14:17.942 --> 14:19.401
Yeah, I was on my way
to tell Howard,

14:19.485 --> 14:21.111
and then I remembered
I wasn't speaking to him,

14:21.195 --> 14:22.530
so I came over here.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.740
Don't you think it's time
you two made up?

14:24.823 --> 14:25.824
No.

14:25.908 --> 14:28.118
No, actually.
I don't need his negative energy

14:28.202 --> 14:29.662
in my life right now.

14:29.745 --> 14:31.580
Standing up to him was hard,

14:31.664 --> 14:34.250
but it made me realize
that I can do anything.

14:34.458 --> 14:37.545
And, yeah, it's a little sad,
but, you know,

14:37.753 --> 14:40.047
life is all about...

14:41.549 --> 14:44.260
Sorry.
I thought you were wrapping things up.

14:48.639 --> 14:50.099
- Hey, Howard.
- Hey.

14:50.182 --> 14:51.475
Where is everybody?

14:51.600 --> 14:53.435
I could ask you
the same question.

14:55.354 --> 14:58.065
Wow, this conversation got mean fast.

14:59.149 --> 15:01.485
Sorry. I'm just in a bad mood.

15:01.610 --> 15:02.987
Yeah? What's going on?

15:03.070 --> 15:05.531
I had a falling out with Raj.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.199
He said I make fun of him too much

15:07.283 --> 15:09.201
and that it's wrecked his confidence.

15:09.493 --> 15:11.787
Please.
Confidence is like red blood cells.

15:11.870 --> 15:14.498
Nice if you got some,
but you don't need 'em.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.043
Yeah. I mean, your life's a mess.

15:18.127 --> 15:20.796
I don't see you blaming
other people for it.

15:20.879 --> 15:24.425
That's right. I grew up in a
loving, supportive household.

15:25.843 --> 15:27.428
This is all on me.

15:30.180 --> 15:32.683
Maybe I'll just hang out here
for a while.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.893
Great. And you can make fun of me
all you want.

15:34.977 --> 15:36.186
No, that's okay.

15:36.353 --> 15:37.980
No, no, no. Go on. I can take it.

15:38.063 --> 15:40.608
My feelings,
like my extremities,

15:40.691 --> 15:42.568
are basically numb.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.197
Here's your license.

15:47.281 --> 15:48.407
Now, if you wait over there,

15:48.490 --> 15:50.159
we'll call you
when the officiant's ready.

15:50.326 --> 15:51.577
Do we need a blood test?

15:51.827 --> 15:53.078
No.

15:53.329 --> 15:55.873
Well, then how will you know
whether or not we have syphilis?

15:58.876 --> 16:02.004
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say you don't have that.

16:05.049 --> 16:07.426
Okay, Sheldon, you officially
exceeded the number of times

16:07.509 --> 16:10.471
I hoped to hear the word
"syphilis" on my wedding day.

16:12.222 --> 16:13.682
I can't believe we're doing this.

16:13.766 --> 16:15.976
I know. I'm getting married.

16:16.060 --> 16:18.270
The new <i>Star Wars</i> movie's coming out.

16:19.355 --> 16:21.982
We are really
finishing this year strong.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.110
Okay, but of the two of those...

16:25.194 --> 16:27.571
You know, I'm not even gonna ask.
I'm not gonna ask.

16:32.284 --> 16:34.745
Are you sad we're not
having a big party?

16:36.413 --> 16:38.123
I'm really not.

16:38.874 --> 16:41.293
I'm here with you. It's perfect.

16:45.547 --> 16:46.882
Cooper-Fowler?

16:47.007 --> 16:48.217
<i>You're up.</i>

16:50.094 --> 16:51.387
Can you believe it?

16:51.470 --> 16:55.516
We're about to walk in that door,
Dr. Cooper and Dr. Fowler,

16:55.599 --> 16:57.935
and walk out
as a married couple,

16:58.060 --> 17:00.729
Dr. Cooper and Dr. Fowler.

17:03.941 --> 17:05.275
Wait.

17:06.694 --> 17:08.904
I want to have a first dance with you.

17:09.780 --> 17:11.365
Right here?

17:11.532 --> 17:12.700
At our wedding.

17:13.742 --> 17:15.035
But this is our wedding.

17:15.119 --> 17:16.328
No.

17:17.996 --> 17:19.540
I want a real wedding.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.211
Sheldon, it was just making us fight.

17:24.294 --> 17:26.630
I know. But, Amy,

17:27.256 --> 17:29.341
I never thought
I'd want to marry anyone.

17:29.508 --> 17:33.637
So the fact that I found you
is astonishing.

17:33.887 --> 17:36.724
It's like finding dark matter,

17:37.099 --> 17:38.475
except they're looking
for dark matter.

17:38.559 --> 17:40.436
I wasn't even looking for you.

17:42.187 --> 17:43.939
So you're even better
than dark matter.

17:45.107 --> 17:46.191
Sheldon.

17:46.275 --> 17:49.778
Plus, plus, you interact with light,
so I can see you.

17:50.946 --> 17:53.490
And, also, you don't account
for the missing mass

17:53.574 --> 17:55.743
- in the universe. And...
- Okay, I think

17:55.826 --> 17:58.454
you're getting caught up on the
ways I'm not like dark matter.

17:58.746 --> 18:00.205
Right. Sorry.

18:00.330 --> 18:03.959
But when you make
a discovery like this,

18:04.460 --> 18:06.420
you don't just take it down
to City Hall,

18:06.503 --> 18:08.005
you tell the whole world.

18:08.088 --> 18:11.508
And, so I'll say it in Latin or Klingon

18:11.592 --> 18:12.760
or smoke signals,

18:12.843 --> 18:15.012
if that's not cultural appropriation.

18:15.095 --> 18:17.347
- It is.
- Okay, so not smoke signals.

18:19.475 --> 18:21.310
But I want to do this right.

18:24.480 --> 18:25.689
Me too.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.776
Let's go plan a wedding.

18:37.367 --> 18:39.286
You know, we did get dressed up

18:39.369 --> 18:41.747
and come all the way
to City Hall.

18:42.372 --> 18:43.707
What are you thinking?

18:43.791 --> 18:47.961
I have always wanted a permit
to dispose of hazardous waste.

18:50.339 --> 18:51.924
Let's do it.

18:58.388 --> 19:02.226
Do we know if there's life in
the methane plumes of Enceladus

19:02.559 --> 19:05.395
or under the icy surface
of Europa?

19:06.188 --> 19:09.066
Come back on Tuesday
for my next show to find out.

19:09.817 --> 19:12.361
Spoiler alert, we don't.

19:14.321 --> 19:16.114
I'm Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali,

19:16.198 --> 19:18.408
and thank you for taking
a walk with me

19:18.867 --> 19:20.077
through the stars.

19:22.204 --> 19:25.374
Wow. I never knew science
could be so interesting.

19:25.457 --> 19:27.334
Hey, I talk to you
about science all the time.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.628
Oh, you sure do, sweetie.

19:31.505 --> 19:33.048
Should we go congratulate him?

19:33.131 --> 19:36.343
I'll do better than that.
I'll give him constructive criticism.

19:36.593 --> 19:40.013
Here's some constructive criticism,
don't.

19:44.059 --> 19:45.769
- I'll catch up with you guys.
- Yeah.

19:46.645 --> 19:48.188
Raj, you were terrific!

19:48.272 --> 19:50.774
Thank you. I was so nervous,
my armpits are like a swamp.

19:50.858 --> 19:53.735
Oh. Your hug just got
downgraded to a high five.

19:53.902 --> 19:56.822
Your palms are sweaty, too.

19:57.072 --> 19:59.449
Hey. What are you doing
all the way in the back?

19:59.825 --> 20:01.076
Hiding out.

20:01.451 --> 20:03.287
I wasn't sure if I was welcome.

20:03.495 --> 20:05.747
This is ridiculous.
You guys are best friends.

20:05.831 --> 20:07.249
Of course he wants you here.

20:07.624 --> 20:10.711
You sure? He seems to be doing
pretty well without me.

20:10.961 --> 20:12.880
Look, he was just stressed out.

20:13.046 --> 20:14.756
His life is not better
without you.

20:14.840 --> 20:16.300
Come on. Come say hi.

20:17.593 --> 20:19.094
Okay.

20:20.053 --> 20:23.807
Dr. Koothrappali, I just wanted
to tell you that was amazing.

20:24.057 --> 20:26.351
- Counterpoint...
- To the car.

20:27.769 --> 20:29.062
Can I ask you a question?

20:29.146 --> 20:31.398
Of course, you can. That went well.

20:31.481 --> 20:33.066
Ask me another.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.320
I think I'm just gonna go.

20:38.447 --> 20:40.908
If there is life beneath
the surface of these planets,

20:41.033 --> 20:42.659
how would we even detect it?

20:43.118 --> 20:45.078
That's a complicated question.

20:45.287 --> 20:46.830
Let me start with a simpler one.

20:46.997 --> 20:48.498
Can I buy you a coffee?

20:49.458 --> 20:51.710
Also, a complicated question.

20:51.877 --> 20:54.171
Because I want to say yes,
but if I drink coffee this late,

20:54.254 --> 20:55.380
then I'll be up all night.

20:55.505 --> 20:57.132
Decaf, genius.

20:58.216 --> 20:59.593
I would love to.

21:26.411 --> 21:27.412
English - SDH
