WEBVTT

00:05.965 --> 00:07.175
What are you doing?

00:07.550 --> 00:09.719
The light is red, so I came to a stop.

00:10.303 --> 00:13.431
You're in a stolen cop car
with a dead hooker in the trunk.

00:13.515 --> 00:15.266
You don't have to obey traffic laws.

00:17.143 --> 00:18.937
I know I don't have to.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.814
The fun is choosing to.

00:23.525 --> 00:26.277
Hey. Missed you guys
at the faculty mixer.

00:26.486 --> 00:28.988
Oh, you should have been there.
Dessert was bananas.

00:29.864 --> 00:30.865
Sorry, that was misleading.

00:30.949 --> 00:33.201
The dessert was pie,
but the pie was bananas.

00:34.494 --> 00:35.954
Actually, the pie was cherry,

00:36.037 --> 00:38.832
but the taste of the pie was bananas.

00:42.001 --> 00:45.547
Those mixers are such
a waste of University money.

00:45.630 --> 00:46.923
If they spend less money

00:47.006 --> 00:50.719
on frivolous nonsense and more money
on science, we'd all be better off.

00:50.802 --> 00:52.595
You're a theoretical physicist.

00:52.679 --> 00:55.265
What more do you need
than an office and a white board?

00:55.682 --> 00:58.518
Someday my new formulas
on entropy decrease

00:58.601 --> 01:00.770
due to quantum de-coherence
will need to be tested

01:00.854 --> 01:02.731
and that will require funding.

01:02.939 --> 01:04.774
Your theories are pretty abstract.

01:04.858 --> 01:07.736
I wouldn't even know how to design
an experiment to prove them.

01:08.570 --> 01:10.739
Says the experimental physicist.

01:12.532 --> 01:14.659
Well, I know a place the University
can make some cuts.

01:14.743 --> 01:15.994
Bye, Leonard.

01:16.703 --> 01:18.663
One second, he's got a point.

01:18.747 --> 01:20.832
In order to corroborate
your string theory research,

01:20.915 --> 01:22.167
you'd have to create a black hole.

01:22.417 --> 01:23.960
Wouldn't that destroy the Earth?

01:24.252 --> 01:25.587
Well, perhaps.

01:25.670 --> 01:28.006
But we'd all go to the grave
knowing I was right.

01:30.091 --> 01:33.720
I guess you could create
a contained microscopic black hole.

01:34.137 --> 01:35.138
Huh!

01:35.472 --> 01:37.056
Interesting.

01:37.682 --> 01:39.142
Welcome back, Leonard.

01:40.185 --> 01:41.519
Sorry, you're out.

01:42.645 --> 01:43.897
What did I do?

01:43.980 --> 01:45.064
Exactly.

02:15.386 --> 02:16.471
Ooh! This one's pretty.

02:16.679 --> 02:19.641
Mmm, my mother wouldn't approve.
Shows too much clavicle.

02:21.184 --> 02:22.894
She calls it "the bosom's welcome mat."

02:24.395 --> 02:25.563
I can't wait to get drunk

02:25.647 --> 02:27.398
and pick a fight with her
at your wedding.

02:29.442 --> 02:31.820
It's just so hard to tell
what will look good on me.

02:31.903 --> 02:33.530
No, this is just to give you ideas,
you know.

02:33.613 --> 02:35.698
Do you want something
simple and elegant?

02:35.782 --> 02:36.991
Do you want a train...

02:37.200 --> 02:39.202
Oh! We're talking about trains.

02:40.245 --> 02:41.579
Not the kind of trains you like.

02:41.663 --> 02:43.206
Oh, I like all kinds of trains.

02:43.289 --> 02:46.292
Steam, diesel, coal, elevated, bullet.

02:46.376 --> 02:49.128
Now, I defy you
to name a train that I don't like.

02:49.295 --> 02:50.922
The kind on the back of a wedding dress?

02:51.422 --> 02:53.383
I did not see that coming, good job.

02:54.884 --> 02:56.761
Although, while we're on
the subject of fashion,

02:56.845 --> 02:59.472
I am asking the University
for some funding tomorrow.

02:59.556 --> 03:00.598
What should I wear?

03:00.682 --> 03:04.227
I've got a push-up bra I can loan you
that always gets me free drinks.

03:05.812 --> 03:07.272
How much money are you asking for?

03:07.397 --> 03:09.023
$500 million.

03:10.984 --> 03:12.360
Then I'd go no bra.

03:14.445 --> 03:16.406
What do you need that kind of money for?

03:16.489 --> 03:19.033
I have figured out
an experimental design

03:19.117 --> 03:21.953
that may corroborate
my latest thinking on string theory.

03:22.036 --> 03:25.415
I just need 2,148 high-power lasers

03:25.498 --> 03:28.585
to compress 20 mg of gold
into a small enough volume

03:28.668 --> 03:30.628
to make a microscopic black hole.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.341
- Just nod.
- Mmm.

03:36.593 --> 03:38.887
Sheldon, they're not gonna give you
half a billion dollars.

03:39.137 --> 03:40.889
I mean, they won't even
give me that much

03:40.972 --> 03:44.434
and I keep promising I can make
people's brains grow younger.

03:46.728 --> 03:47.729
Can you?

03:47.854 --> 03:49.272
No.

03:50.940 --> 03:51.941
But I need it.

03:52.025 --> 03:53.860
It's the only way
to settle the contradictions

03:53.943 --> 03:56.112
between gravity and quantum mechanics.

03:56.195 --> 03:58.907
Well, it's too much money,
you can't ask for that all at once.

03:59.157 --> 04:01.826
Well, what if I ask for it
in six easy installments

04:01.910 --> 04:05.997
of $83,333,333.33?

04:07.290 --> 04:09.500
Okay, what if you asked for $20 million?

04:09.584 --> 04:11.461
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I'm trying to do science,

04:11.586 --> 04:13.504
not hire Lady Gaga
to come to my birthday.

04:16.799 --> 04:19.010
Do you even know who Lady Gaga is?

04:19.218 --> 04:21.387
Presumably the wife of Lord Gaga.

04:25.058 --> 04:27.352
Sheldon, you know, Penny's got a point.

04:27.435 --> 04:30.229
Sometimes when you want
something big from someone,

04:30.313 --> 04:32.815
you gotta to be careful
not to scare them away, you know.

04:32.899 --> 04:35.902
You've gotta start small
and build up slowly,

04:35.985 --> 04:39.072
even if it takes eight years.

04:41.950 --> 04:44.577
Eight long years.

04:47.497 --> 04:49.415
That's oddly specific.

04:50.959 --> 04:52.251
Have you ever done that?

04:53.294 --> 04:54.295
Nope.

05:01.886 --> 05:05.932
So, with this level of high-power
laser array, we would actually be able

05:06.015 --> 05:09.227
to solve the black hole information
paradox once and for all.

05:09.477 --> 05:12.397
That's impressive, and how much funding
were you looking for?

05:12.647 --> 05:14.107
$20 million.

05:14.524 --> 05:17.652
Really? You think you can build that
for $20 million?

05:17.944 --> 05:19.278
Not a chance.

05:20.530 --> 05:22.949
I'm sorry,
then why are you asking me for it?

05:23.116 --> 05:25.660
Because once you've spent $20 million,

05:25.743 --> 05:28.663
you're much more likely
to give me an additional $50.

05:28.955 --> 05:32.250
So actually what you're saying is
with $70 million you can build this.

05:32.458 --> 05:34.877
I see why you'd think that, but no.

05:36.004 --> 05:37.922
You can't go to the board of trustees

05:38.006 --> 05:40.425
and say you gave Sheldon Cooper
$70 million

05:40.508 --> 05:41.509
and have nothing to show for it.

05:41.592 --> 05:45.346
No. The only way you'd be
able to save face is to double down.

05:45.763 --> 05:48.558
- So $140?
- And then double again.

05:49.684 --> 05:50.727
$280?

05:50.810 --> 05:53.771
And then good news, not quite,
double again.

05:55.481 --> 05:57.817
So, what do you say? We have a deal?

06:00.153 --> 06:01.654
- He said no?
- No.

06:01.738 --> 06:04.699
That's only a two-letter word.
You're gonna have to double down.

06:07.118 --> 06:08.119
I'm sorry, Sheldon,

06:08.202 --> 06:09.746
but this sort of thing happens.

06:09.954 --> 06:12.999
Higgs had to wait almost 50 years
before they built a collider

06:13.082 --> 06:14.459
big enough to prove his theory.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.002
50 years?

06:16.085 --> 06:18.004
But I want to play with it now.

06:19.297 --> 06:21.299
You just have to wait
for science to catch up,

06:21.382 --> 06:22.925
or technology to get cheaper.

06:23.009 --> 06:26.554
Think about DVD players,
they used to cost like $1,000,

06:26.637 --> 06:29.015
but just the other day
I used one to smash a bug.

06:31.809 --> 06:33.603
Yeah, you just have to be patient.

06:33.728 --> 06:37.356
But what if while I'm being patient
someone more relentless than me

06:37.440 --> 06:39.901
badgers their university
into giving them money?

06:40.276 --> 06:43.404
If there's someone more relentless
than you, I'd like to meet them.

06:45.198 --> 06:46.449
I would not.

06:47.700 --> 06:50.453
I'm not waiting
for the University to come around.

06:50.745 --> 06:52.705
I'll find another way
to raise the money.

06:52.789 --> 06:54.999
Ooh! If it's one of those booths
where we can throw a pie at you

06:55.083 --> 06:56.501
I'm in for, like, 20 bucks.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.046
Forty bucks if I can throw a DVD player.

07:04.759 --> 07:06.135
Would you like some champagne?

07:06.219 --> 07:07.637
- Oh, thank you.
- Thanks.

07:07.720 --> 07:08.721
Sure.

07:09.222 --> 07:10.223
This is nice.

07:10.306 --> 07:12.683
What, helping Amy find a dress
or day-drinking?

07:14.185 --> 07:15.520
It's just nice, okay.

07:17.897 --> 07:18.981
What do you think?

07:19.482 --> 07:20.900
Amy, oh, my God.

07:20.983 --> 07:22.235
You look so beautiful.

07:22.318 --> 07:24.070
I feel beautiful.

07:24.153 --> 07:27.198
And look, both clavicles.
Take that, Mom.

07:29.575 --> 07:31.702
You know what they say,
if got 'em flaunt 'em.

07:32.829 --> 07:36.124
Is it possible that
the very first dress is the dress?

07:36.207 --> 07:39.252
No. Don't be silly, you can't buy
the first dress you try on.

07:39.335 --> 07:41.504
That'd be like marrying
the first guy that you...

07:43.714 --> 07:46.801
You can't buy
the first dress you try on.

07:48.970 --> 07:51.848
Little finger sandwiches, too.
This place is amazing.

07:51.931 --> 07:53.391
Interesting thing
about finger sandwiches,

07:53.474 --> 07:55.977
you put enough of them together,
you've got a sandwich.

07:58.604 --> 08:00.022
Guys, we have a problem.

08:00.189 --> 08:01.315
- Are you okay?
- What's wrong?

08:01.732 --> 08:03.776
I look amazing in all of these dresses!

08:05.528 --> 08:07.613
Look at your waist,
where you been hiding that thing?

08:09.031 --> 08:10.783
Bernadette, stop.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.369
Penny, you say something nice now.

08:15.454 --> 08:17.331
Boy, you know,
when Sheldon sees you in that dress,

08:17.415 --> 08:20.042
he's gonna wanna
methodically take it off, fold it up,

08:20.126 --> 08:23.838
carefully place it in a storage box,
label it, and then ravish you.

08:25.173 --> 08:26.215
Should I try on some more?

08:26.299 --> 08:27.300
Are you having fun?

08:27.383 --> 08:29.510
Am I having fun being beautiful?
Of course I am!

08:30.344 --> 08:31.929
All right, keep going.

08:33.139 --> 08:34.182
This is it.

08:34.265 --> 08:35.725
This is the one.

08:43.149 --> 08:44.483
Do you love it?

08:45.818 --> 08:46.944
Do you?

08:48.696 --> 08:49.947
I do.

08:51.449 --> 08:52.450
Wow.

08:54.577 --> 08:56.871
Also wow.

09:01.542 --> 09:02.877
- Hello, Leonard.
- Hi.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.295
Are you doing anything?

09:04.420 --> 09:08.382
No, I'm just sitting here at my desk
typing on my computer for nothing.

09:09.759 --> 09:11.510
That was my guess,
but I didn't want to assume.

09:12.929 --> 09:16.098
Can you help me
shoot my kick-starter video?

09:16.307 --> 09:19.393
Do you really think people are gonna
give you half a billion dollars?

09:19.518 --> 09:23.272
Of course not, but if I can raise enough
seed money to show that I'm serious,

09:23.356 --> 09:25.775
I should be able to attract
some major investors.

09:25.900 --> 09:29.445
And look at the cool incentives
I'm offering.

09:30.238 --> 09:33.032
"For $50,000, I will examine your diet

09:33.115 --> 09:35.701
"and create a customized
bathroom schedule."

09:38.287 --> 09:40.915
That's fitting,
50 grand down the toilet.

09:41.791 --> 09:43.960
How about this. "For $100,000

09:44.043 --> 09:46.837
"I will design the flag of your house
or apartment,

09:46.921 --> 09:48.798
"and for $1 million

09:48.881 --> 09:51.425
"I will come over and tell you
what's wrong with you."

09:53.844 --> 09:56.389
Aw! All these years
I've been getting that for free.

09:58.391 --> 10:00.184
Don't be smug, Leonard.

10:00.268 --> 10:01.936
That's one of things
that's wrong with you.

10:05.064 --> 10:06.941
Well, that was a successful trip.

10:07.024 --> 10:08.025
Yes.

10:08.109 --> 10:10.027
Amy found a dress that she liked.

10:10.569 --> 10:11.779
She sure did.

10:13.614 --> 10:16.033
She found a dress that looked like...

10:16.659 --> 10:18.327
Like it made her happy.

10:19.954 --> 10:24.125
She did look happy.
I mean, her face was just glowing, so...

10:25.001 --> 10:26.043
Yeah, we should make sure

10:26.127 --> 10:29.380
the photographer knows to just
really get in there.

10:33.134 --> 10:34.260
So, we agree it's awful?

10:34.385 --> 10:37.305
That dress should be set on fire.

10:39.098 --> 10:40.141
Should we say something?

10:40.224 --> 10:41.350
No, we can't.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.520
Don't you think she brought us with her
because she wants our honest opinion?

10:44.979 --> 10:46.355
No one wants that.

10:47.398 --> 10:48.441
I do.

10:48.566 --> 10:50.526
No, ya don't.

10:51.944 --> 10:54.864
I don't want her to look back
and think she made some awful mistake.

10:55.031 --> 10:57.450
You mean, like your dumb
Cookie Monster tattoo?

10:58.993 --> 11:00.494
See, was that fun?

11:02.246 --> 11:04.540
Someone's gonna say something
and it should be us now

11:04.623 --> 11:06.083
instead of everyone at her wedding.

11:06.375 --> 11:08.419
Okay, but as long as we do it gently.

11:08.586 --> 11:09.837
And together.

11:10.755 --> 11:12.173
What about my dress?

11:12.298 --> 11:13.424
Don't you like it?

11:15.593 --> 11:17.094
- I don't.
- It's beautiful.

11:28.773 --> 11:31.984
Hey, Stuart,
I'd like to sell some comic books.

11:32.068 --> 11:35.780
Oh! I know all about that.
Step one is flunk out of art school.

11:37.907 --> 11:39.158
Why are you selling them?

11:39.241 --> 11:42.453
The University is refusing
to fund my experiment,

11:42.536 --> 11:44.330
so I need to raise money
and do it on my own.

11:44.538 --> 11:45.581
How much do you need?

11:45.664 --> 11:48.959
For a start,
I'm trying to raise $500,000.

11:50.336 --> 11:55.049
Well, I hope you have that rare <i>Superman</i>
printed on the skin of actual Superman.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.219
I know you're making a joke,

11:58.302 --> 12:00.429
but I really do have
some valuable issues in here.

12:00.513 --> 12:02.390
And this is just the first box of many.

12:02.515 --> 12:04.058
All right, let's see what you got.

12:07.436 --> 12:10.564
Is this a complete run
of Todd McFarlane's <i>Spawn?</i>

12:14.527 --> 12:15.861
Yes.

12:16.987 --> 12:21.409
Ooh! Look at this, <i>Giant-SizeX-Men#1,</i>

12:21.659 --> 12:23.953
Len Wein's relaunch of the franchise.

12:24.036 --> 12:25.413
Yeah, I know what it is.

12:25.496 --> 12:27.832
I'm the one who bought it, bagged it,
boarded it and taped it shut

12:27.915 --> 12:29.583
while wearing white cotton gloves.

12:30.668 --> 12:34.630
Okay, well, I... You know, I'm gonna
have to open it to assess its condition.

12:34.839 --> 12:36.465
Just be gentle,

12:36.549 --> 12:38.968
it's never felt
the touch of a man before.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.973
You don't seem like
you really want to sell these.

12:44.473 --> 12:46.434
Of course I don't wanna sell these.

12:46.725 --> 12:48.477
These are all important to me,

12:48.561 --> 12:50.354
but not as important as science.

12:50.438 --> 12:53.357
And if this is the sacrifice
I need to make, then so be it.

12:53.983 --> 12:56.444
Okay, why don't you
leave these here with me

12:56.527 --> 12:57.945
and I'll price them out for you?

12:58.320 --> 13:00.448
Is it okay if I stand here and watch?

13:01.615 --> 13:02.700
Sure.

13:05.119 --> 13:06.537
If anyone asks, tell them I was brave.

13:11.083 --> 13:13.169
Hey, I can't believe
you just threw me under the bus.

13:13.252 --> 13:14.712
I know, right? That was crazy.

13:16.922 --> 13:18.299
Do you know how that makes me look?

13:18.549 --> 13:19.925
That's an easy one, bad.

13:21.510 --> 13:23.304
Why didn't you tell her
that you don't like the dress either?

13:23.387 --> 13:24.889
What happened to our united front?

13:24.972 --> 13:27.475
I'm sorry,
is this your first day being a girl?

13:35.566 --> 13:37.568
Oh! Did your mom pack your lunch?

13:38.235 --> 13:39.528
Of course not.

13:39.737 --> 13:42.573
Do you know how much it costs
to pack a tuna fish sandwich in dry ice

13:42.656 --> 13:44.325
and overnight it from Texas?

13:45.367 --> 13:47.828
Well, I do, and my mother says
it's too expensive.

13:49.038 --> 13:50.664
- I like tuna fish.
- Do you want it?

13:50.748 --> 13:52.374
I'll sell it to you for $5,000.

13:53.417 --> 13:54.585
How's the fundraising going?

13:54.710 --> 13:56.629
That depends. Raj, was that a yes?

13:56.712 --> 13:58.214
- No.
- It's going badly.

13:59.757 --> 14:00.841
How much have you raised?

14:01.050 --> 14:03.219
Well, with my kick-starter campaign,

14:03.302 --> 14:05.638
selling my collectibles
and the money in my bank account,

14:05.721 --> 14:07.515
about $65,000.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.308
Wow! That's a lot.

14:09.391 --> 14:10.559
Not enough.

14:10.726 --> 14:13.771
It's so frustrating
that science should be held hostage

14:13.854 --> 14:14.980
to the almighty dollar.

14:15.272 --> 14:17.608
Don't give up,
you'll find that money somewhere.

14:17.775 --> 14:20.402
- You really think so?
- No, but it's good that he has a hobby.

14:21.362 --> 14:22.863
You ever thought of going to Vegas?

14:23.739 --> 14:25.366
Can you be more specific?

14:26.534 --> 14:27.826
Las Vegas.

14:29.161 --> 14:30.829
Oh! You mean gambling?

14:30.996 --> 14:32.790
Oh, well that's not the worst idea.

14:32.873 --> 14:35.000
Um, it is the worst idea,

14:35.084 --> 14:38.003
and I'm including the year
that Raj wore nothing but tracksuits.

14:40.631 --> 14:42.591
Ordinary people can't beat a casino,

14:42.675 --> 14:45.344
but mathematicians and scientists,
they do it all the time.

14:45.469 --> 14:48.889
A group of students from MIT
took Las Vegas for millions

14:48.973 --> 14:50.391
and that's MIT.

14:51.225 --> 14:52.643
Howard went there.

14:54.478 --> 14:56.981
Come on, Sheldon, I'll give you a ride
out to the desert right now.

14:57.481 --> 14:59.066
No one is going to Vegas.

14:59.525 --> 15:01.235
We weren't gonna make it to Vegas.

15:06.115 --> 15:07.741
Hi, do you have a minute?

15:07.825 --> 15:11.662
Depends, is what I'm wearing okay
or should I go change first?

15:12.788 --> 15:14.498
Look, I'm sorry.

15:14.582 --> 15:16.834
I never should've said
I didn't like your dress.

15:16.917 --> 15:19.670
It's your wedding and all that matters
is that you feel beautiful.

15:20.504 --> 15:21.505
Thank you.

15:22.172 --> 15:23.549
So, are we good?

15:23.674 --> 15:26.343
No. We're not good, you ruined my dress.

15:27.136 --> 15:28.721
What? I just said you should wear it.

15:28.804 --> 15:30.306
Well, I can't wear it now.

15:30.389 --> 15:32.933
I mean, I know you hate it.
That's all I'm gonna be thinking about.

15:33.017 --> 15:34.643
No, I don't hate it.

15:34.727 --> 15:37.271
I asked if you liked it and you said no.

15:37.479 --> 15:39.857
There is a lot of room
between "don't like" and "hate."

15:39.940 --> 15:43.402
You know, it's where you find
rice pudding and jazz.

15:44.903 --> 15:46.655
Anyway, who cares what I think?

15:46.989 --> 15:48.157
I do.

15:48.449 --> 15:52.995
You're the coolest, prettiest,
best-dressed person in my life.

15:53.370 --> 15:57.541
Okay, that would be flattering, except
I know all the people in your life.

15:59.877 --> 16:01.879
Look, Amy, I don't know what to say.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.172
I think I got stuck on the fact

16:03.255 --> 16:06.133
that it's not a dress I would choose,
but it shouldn't be.

16:06.216 --> 16:07.718
You know, it's your dress.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.346
I mean, hey, would you marry Leonard?

16:10.471 --> 16:11.472
Ew!

16:12.931 --> 16:15.768
Okay, a simple "no"
would've been fine, but...

16:17.186 --> 16:18.437
You see my point?

16:19.188 --> 16:20.606
That we're different people.

16:20.731 --> 16:21.857
Yes.

16:21.940 --> 16:25.235
And from now on I'm gonna remember
that this wedding is all about you.

16:26.487 --> 16:28.113
I appreciate that.

16:28.489 --> 16:29.948
You're a good maid of honor.

16:33.243 --> 16:34.870
It's Bernadette. Hello?

16:35.204 --> 16:37.748
I feel bad about
hanging Penny out to dry.

16:37.831 --> 16:40.751
The truth is,
I don't like the dress either.

16:43.045 --> 16:46.006
Are you kidding me?
Now Bernadette doesn't like the dress.

16:46.090 --> 16:47.800
She is the worst.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.598
Anyone seen Sheldon?

16:54.682 --> 16:56.725
Last time I saw Sheldon
was this morning.

16:56.809 --> 16:58.894
Careful, don't say his name
a third time.

17:00.771 --> 17:03.148
You don't think
he actually went to Las Vegas, do you?

17:05.275 --> 17:06.402
Five red.

17:07.611 --> 17:09.071
This is it.

17:10.364 --> 17:12.032
- Is everything okay, sir?
- Oh! Hi.

17:12.116 --> 17:13.409
It's better than okay.

17:13.492 --> 17:17.037
I am a physicist and I've been
observing this wheel for hours

17:17.121 --> 17:19.915
and running a chi-square analysis,
which is how I know

17:19.998 --> 17:24.169
that the ball is far more likely
to land on 32, 17 or five.

17:24.253 --> 17:26.296
So if you could hold off
on replacing this wheel,

17:26.380 --> 17:27.923
I'd like to make several large bets.

17:29.925 --> 17:31.927
Well, good for you. Pelican.

17:32.845 --> 17:33.846
What's pelican?

17:34.346 --> 17:35.472
Sir, would you come with us?

17:35.556 --> 17:37.975
No, I have to place my bet first.
This is for science.

17:38.142 --> 17:40.352
- Seventeen black.
- No!

17:40.644 --> 17:42.521
No!

17:49.695 --> 17:52.364
Guess who's no longer allowed
to set foot in...

17:52.448 --> 17:53.615
Wow!

17:57.369 --> 17:59.121
You look beautiful.

18:01.623 --> 18:02.624
Really?

18:03.292 --> 18:04.752
'Cause I was gonna return it.

18:05.252 --> 18:07.045
Why would you return it?

18:08.130 --> 18:10.215
You look like a pile of swans.

18:14.636 --> 18:16.305
I'm so glad you like it,

18:19.141 --> 18:21.393
'cause it's gonna be my wedding dress.

18:22.436 --> 18:24.354
I can't wait to marry you.

18:28.609 --> 18:30.194
Why do you smell like smoke?

18:32.780 --> 18:34.114
I was in Vegas.

18:34.740 --> 18:35.824
Vegas?

18:35.908 --> 18:38.327
Oh! I'm sorry. Las Vegas.

19:05.813 --> 19:06.814
