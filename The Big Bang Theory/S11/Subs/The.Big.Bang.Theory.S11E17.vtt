WEBVTT

00:03.922 --> 00:06.591
Oh, my God, I can't believe
how big Halley's getting.

00:06.675 --> 00:07.759
Yeah. Where's Howard?

00:07.842 --> 00:08.843
<i>He's changing Michael.</i>

00:08.927 --> 00:10.428
<i>All done. You know, fun fact,</i>

00:10.512 --> 00:13.306
<i>did you know baby boys
can pee straight up?</i>

00:14.849 --> 00:16.726
Grown-up boys, too.

00:18.186 --> 00:19.854
Why would we high-five that?

00:20.939 --> 00:22.482
So how are you guys?

00:22.607 --> 00:23.650
<i>Really good.</i>

00:24.025 --> 00:25.694
<i>Except for when we went
grocery shopping,</i>

00:25.777 --> 00:27.654
<i>and the checkout lady asked
when I was due.</i>

00:27.904 --> 00:29.364
<i>But you handled it well.</i>

00:32.742 --> 00:35.161
Well, if you guys need help,
I'd be happy to come over.

00:35.245 --> 00:37.831
<i>Oh, thanks, but we're really
trying to enjoy this family time</i>

00:37.914 --> 00:39.249
<i>before we both go back to work.</i>

00:39.499 --> 00:40.834
Okay, well, we all miss you.

00:40.917 --> 00:42.669
<i>- You guys, too.</i>
- Bye.

00:43.670 --> 00:46.423
Boy, seeing them
all together like that

00:46.506 --> 00:49.634
has got my biological clock
ticking like crazy.

00:51.302 --> 00:53.805
- Yeah, I don't think men have...
- I do.

00:55.974 --> 00:56.975
- Hi.
- Hello.

00:57.058 --> 00:58.560
- Hey, guys.
- Good news.

00:58.768 --> 01:00.228
We have save the date cards.

01:00.311 --> 01:01.354
- Oh.
- Oh.

01:01.438 --> 01:03.732
Didn't go with my calligrapher.
Interesting.

01:05.775 --> 01:07.026
What is this picture?

01:07.110 --> 01:09.404
Oh, It's an MRI of our brains
photoshopped

01:09.487 --> 01:10.822
to look like they're kissing.

01:12.115 --> 01:13.491
Is it too sexy?

01:13.658 --> 01:15.201
It's too something.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.955
Guys, May 12, that's exciting.

01:19.038 --> 01:21.040
- I know.
- Do you guys have a location yet?

01:21.124 --> 01:22.417
'Cause you don't have a lot of time.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.085
Hey, it took us nine
months to pick a date,

01:24.169 --> 01:26.129
and a week to decide if
brains can have lips on them,

01:26.212 --> 01:27.589
so get in the boat and row.

01:56.534 --> 01:58.787
- Michael's out.
- So is Halley.

01:59.537 --> 02:00.955
Oh, my God, he's so cute.

02:01.498 --> 02:02.749
So is she.

02:03.708 --> 02:05.418
- Switch?
- Yeah.

02:09.339 --> 02:12.383
- Oh, my God, he's so cute.
- So is she.

02:13.218 --> 02:14.803
I just love them so much.

02:15.303 --> 02:16.554
Me, too.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.307
My heart feels like it's gonna explode.

02:19.974 --> 02:22.352
Of course, it's full of brisket,
so it probably will.

02:24.646 --> 02:28.316
I didn't even know I was capable
of loving someone so much.

02:29.484 --> 02:30.485
More than me?

02:31.694 --> 02:33.446
- Oh, what...
- I'm just messing with you.

02:33.530 --> 02:35.114
I totally love them more than you.

02:36.825 --> 02:37.826
I get that.

02:37.992 --> 02:39.452
I would take a bullet for them.

02:40.036 --> 02:43.623
But I would get seriously
mutilated for you.

02:44.749 --> 02:46.167
That's sweet.

02:46.251 --> 02:47.836
But you should know,
if you got seriously mutilated,

02:47.919 --> 02:49.254
I might dump you.

02:50.713 --> 02:53.675
You'd be crazy not to.
Even unmutilated, I'm no prize.

02:56.970 --> 02:59.222
You know, I'm really happy
with our wedding date.

02:59.597 --> 03:03.309
The month squared equals the
square of the sum of the members

03:03.393 --> 03:05.186
of the set of prime factors of the day.

03:05.270 --> 03:06.437
Isn't that romantic?

03:08.022 --> 03:09.858
Yes, it's like that Shakespeare sonnet,

03:09.941 --> 03:11.484
"Shall I compare thee to a day

03:11.568 --> 03:13.444
"that's also a really weird
math problem."

03:15.238 --> 03:18.408
It's a shame you're joking. That'd be
a lovely reading at our ceremony.

03:19.450 --> 03:21.494
Well, we only have
two months to find a venue,

03:21.578 --> 03:23.162
and I had a thought.

03:23.246 --> 03:25.164
What about the Athenaeum club
at Caltech?

03:25.415 --> 03:28.001
Albert Einstein
was a member there.

03:28.084 --> 03:29.168
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

03:29.252 --> 03:31.337
And Albert Einstein was a member there.

03:32.046 --> 03:35.174
- It's close.
- And Albert Einstein was a member there.

03:35.842 --> 03:37.468
And Albert Einstein was a member there.

03:37.552 --> 03:38.887
There!

03:39.429 --> 03:41.973
Now you sound like a woman
who wants to get married.

03:42.724 --> 03:45.393
- So you're interested?
- Oh, of course.

03:45.476 --> 03:47.729
Yeah, but that club
is extremely exclusive.

03:47.854 --> 03:49.606
You know, Leonard's been trying
to get us in there for years,

03:49.689 --> 03:50.815
but no luck.

03:50.899 --> 03:51.900
Well, that's odd.

03:51.983 --> 03:54.068
When I called, they said they'd
be excited to give us a tour.

03:54.319 --> 03:55.612
Well, I suppose we can give it a look,

03:55.695 --> 03:57.530
and if it doesn't work out,
I hear that there is

03:57.614 --> 04:01.117
a nearby Chinese restaurant
that Einstein used to frequent.

04:02.952 --> 04:06.873
Or, we pick a place we like,
and don't worry about Einstein.

04:08.625 --> 04:11.544
Boy, reality TV is right,
brides are crazy.

04:14.839 --> 04:17.050
So, how has it been,
being home with two kids?

04:17.133 --> 04:19.761
Tiring, but super rewarding.

04:20.178 --> 04:22.013
Like Pilates, yeah, got it.

04:23.348 --> 04:26.726
Honestly, it's gonna be hard
when we both go back to work.

04:27.018 --> 04:30.021
I've been thinking maybe
it would be better if

04:30.104 --> 04:32.023
one of us decided to stay home.

04:32.732 --> 04:36.319
I don't know, I was raised
by servants, and look at me.

04:38.154 --> 04:40.657
I literally can't tell
if you think that's good or bad.

04:41.532 --> 04:43.910
Well, on one hand, they filled
my tub with scented oils

04:43.993 --> 04:45.912
and brought me honeyed sweets,
on the other hand,

04:45.995 --> 04:48.122
I spent my twenties incapable
of talking to women.

04:48.206 --> 04:51.626
So you know, pros and cons.

04:54.045 --> 04:57.090
Here's my dilemma.
I kind of want to stay home.

04:57.173 --> 04:59.884
But Bernadette is a way better
parent than I am.

05:00.385 --> 05:01.678
Wait, does Bernadette want to stay home?

05:01.970 --> 05:04.180
I don't know. She's really
invested in her career,

05:04.263 --> 05:05.640
and she's doing great.

05:05.723 --> 05:07.100
I think it should be me.

05:08.434 --> 05:09.852
Wow, I admire you, Howard.

05:09.936 --> 05:13.773
It would be hard for me to buck
traditional gender roles like that.

05:15.817 --> 05:18.778
Didn't you see Taylor Swift
twice this month?

05:21.072 --> 05:24.492
Yeah, because she's hot,
not because she sings my truth.

05:28.371 --> 05:31.165
Did Albert Einstein ever sit
in any of these chairs?

05:31.457 --> 05:32.834
I think these are fairly new.

05:32.917 --> 05:34.377
But Stephen Hawking's eaten here a lot.

05:34.669 --> 05:37.296
Yeah, but he brings
his own chair, you know?

05:39.549 --> 05:41.092
Well, it seems kind of perfect,

05:41.467 --> 05:42.635
and it's close enough to your office,

05:42.719 --> 05:44.220
so you can use the bathroom you like.

05:44.721 --> 05:48.266
I put a sticker over the auto-flush,
so it doesn't startle me.

05:51.269 --> 05:53.104
Here's my card.
Why don't you two talk it over,

05:53.187 --> 05:55.690
and I will check to see
if our soup spoons

05:55.773 --> 05:58.151
are "deeper than they are wide."

06:00.361 --> 06:02.071
What? Too deep is a ladle, not a spoon.

06:04.907 --> 06:06.242
I really like it.

06:06.409 --> 06:08.244
Oh, I must admit, I do, as well.

06:08.578 --> 06:11.706
Look at how somber all
the men in these portraits are.

06:12.081 --> 06:14.625
I feel like that sets
a good tone for our wedding.

06:15.918 --> 06:16.919
Is that Leonard?

06:17.086 --> 06:20.715
Uh, no, no. These are all dead,
accomplished scientists.

06:20.798 --> 06:23.468
Leonard will only ever be
one of those things.

06:24.844 --> 06:27.889
I mean, Leonard and Penny
are right there.

06:29.098 --> 06:31.517
But he told me he checked on
our membership just last week,

06:31.601 --> 06:33.936
and we were still 400th in line.

06:35.188 --> 06:38.524
I'm sure there's an innocent explanation
that won't ruin my day at all.

06:39.776 --> 06:40.777
Leonard.

06:40.860 --> 06:41.861
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

06:41.944 --> 06:42.945
How did you get in here?

06:43.112 --> 06:44.655
What do you mean? Leonard's a member.

06:46.407 --> 06:48.242
You told me it was incredibly exclusive.

06:48.951 --> 06:51.621
Yeah, look, about that, I lied.

06:53.289 --> 06:55.208
Hey, wait, you told me
it was exclusive, too.

06:55.291 --> 06:59.170
Mm-hmm. I avoided him and impressed you,
all with the same lie.

07:00.213 --> 07:02.256
Damn, Hofstadter, didn't
think you had it in you.

07:03.508 --> 07:05.927
Well, I'm not sure I know
how I feel about this place now.

07:06.219 --> 07:07.386
Then don't turn around.

07:07.637 --> 07:09.180
Cooper!

07:13.601 --> 07:15.269
Oh. Good, you're here.

07:15.603 --> 07:18.689
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

07:19.065 --> 07:21.984
We're not putting a TV in the bathroom.
That's how you get hemorrhoids.

07:23.945 --> 07:25.238
No, this is important.

07:25.613 --> 07:26.739
Uh...

07:26.864 --> 07:30.660
I was thinking maybe one of us should
stay home full-time, with the kids.

07:31.202 --> 07:34.372
Oh, great, so I have to give up my job
and everything I've worked for?

07:35.456 --> 07:37.542
Actually, I was thinking
I should stay home.

07:37.834 --> 07:40.211
Oh, so I have to abandon
my children and go back to work,

07:40.294 --> 07:42.421
while you get to stay home
and bond with them?

07:44.048 --> 07:45.758
You just said you didn't want to.

07:46.217 --> 07:49.846
No, I don't want to have to,
but if I want to, I should get to.

07:52.890 --> 07:53.933
Do you want to?

07:55.059 --> 07:56.185
Maybe I do.

07:56.519 --> 07:57.937
What if I also want to?

07:58.146 --> 08:00.565
Well, I don't know,
we can't both stay home.

08:01.149 --> 08:03.151
Don't you think
you should go back to work,

08:03.234 --> 08:04.861
because you make more money?

08:04.944 --> 08:06.362
Don't you think
you should make more money?

08:08.573 --> 08:10.324
I think it's pretty sexist of you to say

08:10.408 --> 08:12.577
a dad can't stay home with his children.

08:13.244 --> 08:15.454
You know what else is sexist,
the phrase "suck it,"

08:15.538 --> 08:16.664
yet, here we are.

08:20.835 --> 08:23.129
I can't believe Leonard lied to me.

08:23.212 --> 08:24.672
What are we gonna find out next,

08:24.755 --> 08:26.924
that he's not really lactose intolerant?

08:28.593 --> 08:31.470
He's just friends with
an invisible trumpet player?

08:32.972 --> 08:36.058
I know you're upset, but if
we want to book the Athenaeum,

08:36.142 --> 08:38.561
we really should do it
now, and then, I promise,

08:38.644 --> 08:40.855
we'll have our whole lives
to complain about Leonard.

08:42.607 --> 08:45.610
Oh, somebody got a head start
on her vows.

08:47.445 --> 08:49.739
So do we agree?
Do we want to get married there?

08:50.031 --> 08:51.490
I don't know.

08:51.574 --> 08:54.285
I mean, Einstein was a member.
I like that.

08:54.368 --> 08:58.372
You know? But Leonard's a member,
and that really steams my clams.

08:59.832 --> 09:02.376
Oh, I love it when you're folksy.
I'm just gonna call.

09:03.002 --> 09:06.088
On the other hand, shaming
Leonard during our wedding

09:06.172 --> 09:07.798
at the very place he betrayed me

09:07.882 --> 09:10.259
does have a beautiful symmetry to it.

09:11.886 --> 09:14.805
That's nice, it'll be your first
petty act as a married man.

09:17.099 --> 09:18.351
Oh, hi, Kathleen?

09:19.143 --> 09:21.270
Yeah, this is Amy from earlier.

09:21.354 --> 09:23.856
I'd like to go ahead and reserve May 12.

09:24.273 --> 09:26.108
Although, it is our wedding.

09:26.192 --> 09:28.527
Well, maybe it shouldn't be
all about revenge.

09:30.863 --> 09:32.365
Oh, I see.

09:32.615 --> 09:34.325
Okay, thanks.

09:37.411 --> 09:40.456
- Someone booked our date.
- Uh... What?

09:40.748 --> 09:41.749
Who?

09:42.583 --> 09:44.585
Well, well, well.

09:46.504 --> 09:48.422
This is a pickle.

09:49.548 --> 09:53.177
Yes, so, if you will just move
your birthday party

09:53.261 --> 09:55.680
to a different location,
everything will be fine.

09:56.180 --> 09:57.932
Oh, it's tricky.

09:58.224 --> 10:01.227
I don't want to move my party,
but I also don't want to help you...

10:01.310 --> 10:03.104
Oh, wait, I don't have a problem.

10:05.982 --> 10:07.066
No. I do.

10:07.441 --> 10:09.026
Yeah, you do.

10:16.117 --> 10:18.160
- Morning.
- Hey, where you been?

10:18.411 --> 10:21.414
Oh, nowhere special.
Just the park, the farmer's market,

10:21.497 --> 10:23.082
then we hopped on the Gold Line
to Chinatown

10:23.165 --> 10:26.502
because it's important for the kids
to experience other cultures.

10:26.585 --> 10:27.962
What have you been doing?

10:29.422 --> 10:31.007
It's 8:00 a.m. Sleeping.

10:31.132 --> 10:33.759
Oh, so are the kids.
I guess they take after you.

10:37.263 --> 10:39.640
You're just trying to prove that
you'd do a better job than me.

10:39.974 --> 10:42.935
You're pretty sharp
having just woken up.

10:44.312 --> 10:47.106
Howard, we both know
you can't keep up this pace.

10:47.440 --> 10:49.734
By this afternoon you're gonna
be passed out on the couch

10:49.817 --> 10:52.111
and I'm gonna have three
exhausted babies to deal with.

10:52.987 --> 10:54.822
Not true. I got this.

10:54.905 --> 10:57.325
You know, in fact,
why don't you take the day off?

10:57.908 --> 11:00.619
Fine. Maybe I'll have lunch with Penny.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.872
Take your time. Get a massage.

11:02.955 --> 11:06.125
You deserve it after all
the sleep you've been getting.

11:09.420 --> 11:11.130
Maybe Barry will change his mind.

11:11.756 --> 11:13.299
Oh, I doubt it.

11:13.382 --> 11:15.676
I said some pretty unprofessional things
about his work.

11:16.427 --> 11:18.512
I may have even used the "S" word.

11:20.181 --> 11:22.058
Subpar?

11:23.392 --> 11:25.436
I'm not proud of it, Amy,
but I have a temper.

11:26.854 --> 11:29.357
Well, I suppose we could pick
a different date.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.317
Well, it took you nine months
to choose that one.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.902
I'll pick a different husband first.

11:37.073 --> 11:40.076
Hey, I just, I wanted to
apologize about the Athenaeum.

11:40.368 --> 11:42.495
- Why did you lie to me?
- I don't know.

11:42.578 --> 11:44.163
It just seemed funny at first

11:44.246 --> 11:47.124
and then the longer it went on,
funnier it got.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.462
So, yeah, I guess that's why.

11:53.214 --> 11:54.673
That's not much of an apology.

11:54.965 --> 11:56.425
Yeah, because he's not really sorry.

11:56.801 --> 11:59.303
Obviously, he wanted a place
to go where I wouldn't be

11:59.553 --> 12:02.681
and apparently all of outside
wasn't enough for him.

12:03.599 --> 12:04.892
Come on. I do feel bad.

12:05.226 --> 12:07.019
Uh, why? Did your best friend
hurt your feelings?

12:07.228 --> 12:08.229
- Come on, Sheldon.
- Look,

12:08.312 --> 12:10.272
I only have time to deal
with one jerk right now

12:10.356 --> 12:12.066
- and that's Barry Kripke.
- What?

12:12.608 --> 12:14.819
He has the Athenaeum booked
for our wedding date

12:14.902 --> 12:16.570
- and he won't give it up.
- Yeah, so if you could just

12:16.654 --> 12:18.614
please leave before I get angry

12:18.697 --> 12:21.367
and say something I will regret
about your face, your height,

12:21.450 --> 12:24.245
your personal hygiene or
the fact that your science,

12:24.328 --> 12:27.081
while serviceable, lacks panache.

12:28.082 --> 12:31.168
That's actually one of the nicest things
you've ever said about my work.

12:32.253 --> 12:34.213
And now I regret it. Goodbye.

12:39.176 --> 12:40.344
Hey. There you are.

12:40.428 --> 12:42.471
Yeah, I just wanted to stop in
and see my office

12:42.555 --> 12:43.681
before we went to lunch.

12:43.764 --> 12:45.724
Just a few more weeks,
you'll be back full-time, huh?

12:46.100 --> 12:47.226
Yeah.

12:48.436 --> 12:50.521
Oh-oh. That wasn't a happy "yeah."

12:50.604 --> 12:52.690
That was a "Hey, Leonard,
do you want to go to the gym?" yeah.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.652
I've just been thinking
that maybe I'd rather

12:56.735 --> 12:58.571
stay home with the kids and be a mom.

12:59.572 --> 13:00.865
Wow. That's big.

13:01.073 --> 13:02.074
I know.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.661
Dr. Rostenkowski.
I'm sorry, I didn't know you were back.

13:05.744 --> 13:08.205
I'm not
I just came to meet Penny for lunch.

13:08.289 --> 13:10.624
Is there anything I can get you?
Coffee? Water?

13:10.708 --> 13:12.793
- No, I think we're just gonna...
- Coffee sounds good.

13:13.711 --> 13:15.546
- Cold brew, almond milk?
- Perfect.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.214
Nothing, nothing for me.

13:19.550 --> 13:22.636
It's weird. I've been away so long
I don't miss any of this.

13:24.805 --> 13:25.806
<i>Sorry to bother you.</i>

13:25.890 --> 13:27.892
<i>Dr. Lee heard you were here
and had a quick question.</i>

13:28.100 --> 13:29.727
Yeah, fine. Put him on.

13:31.312 --> 13:34.523
Jerold, what's going on?
Hope you're not screwing up my research.

13:36.150 --> 13:38.694
You calling from a bike ride?
'Cause you're backpedaling hard.

13:39.570 --> 13:41.363
All right, fine. Email it over.
I'll take a look.

13:45.409 --> 13:46.452
Mm-hmm.

13:46.535 --> 13:47.578
Oh, sorry. Where were we?

13:47.995 --> 13:49.497
Love your kids. Don't miss your job.

13:49.705 --> 13:50.998
Right, right.

13:52.541 --> 13:55.294
There's nothing in the world
like holding your sleeping baby,

13:55.377 --> 13:57.379
knowing you make him
feel safe and then...

13:57.463 --> 13:59.507
Oh, good, you got the little cookies
I like.

14:00.633 --> 14:03.177
I wouldn't mind a cookie.
And he's gone. Okay.

14:12.603 --> 14:14.688
- Hey, Kripke.
- Hello, Hofstadter.

14:16.690 --> 14:19.151
Why are you cleaning that out
yourself? Don't you have grad students?

14:19.693 --> 14:23.697
Come on, I can't make my grad
students do every dirty job

14:23.781 --> 14:27.326
or so I've been told in writing
by the head of Human Resources.

14:29.453 --> 14:31.372
Fair enough. Uh, so, look,

14:31.455 --> 14:34.083
I'm here to ask you
to give Sheldon and Amy

14:34.166 --> 14:35.584
the Athenaeum for their wedding.

14:38.254 --> 14:39.672
Why would I do that?

14:41.298 --> 14:45.052
Because deep down, Barry,
you're a really good guy.

14:46.512 --> 14:47.846
But am I?

14:50.975 --> 14:52.184
Fine. What's it gonna take?

14:58.607 --> 15:00.317
Barry, I've come to ask one more...

15:01.569 --> 15:03.988
Leonard? Why are you doing that?

15:04.655 --> 15:07.575
Because deep down
Barry is not a good guy.

15:08.826 --> 15:11.912
Uh, he's making you clean out
barrels of irradiated grease?

15:12.496 --> 15:13.789
Yeah. Uh...

15:15.249 --> 15:16.875
I made a deal with him

15:16.959 --> 15:19.336
to get you the Athenaeum
for your wedding.

15:20.754 --> 15:22.047
Why would you do that?

15:23.507 --> 15:25.968
Because I was a jerk
for lying to you before

15:26.051 --> 15:27.553
and besides, you're my best friend.

15:27.636 --> 15:29.305
I want you to have
the wedding of your dreams.

15:31.056 --> 15:32.600
On Mars?

15:36.103 --> 15:38.564
Okay, I want Amy to have
the wedding of her dreams.

15:39.690 --> 15:40.774
Well, thank you.

15:40.858 --> 15:43.027
But I don't want you to do this.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.487
- No, it's okay.
- No, it's not.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.656
We're not going to let Barry win.

15:47.740 --> 15:48.824
Well, what are we going to do?

15:49.533 --> 15:52.161
We have a combined IQ of 360.

15:52.244 --> 15:55.372
Perhaps more if that radiation
gave you a super brain.

15:57.416 --> 15:58.542
You know what? You're right.

15:58.834 --> 16:02.421
If we work together we could
totally outsmart Barry Kripke.

16:10.512 --> 16:12.640
Leonard, my nose itches. What do I do?

16:16.101 --> 16:19.480
Boy. I really passed out hard.

16:19.772 --> 16:20.773
Yeah, tell me about it.

16:20.856 --> 16:24.026
The kids could've screamed bloody murder
and you wouldn't have woken up.

16:24.610 --> 16:26.570
Which I know because they did.

16:28.530 --> 16:29.573
I'm sorry.

16:29.657 --> 16:31.700
Why did I think I could
do this on my own?

16:32.076 --> 16:35.329
Hey, don't beat yourself up.
Parenting is hard.

16:35.663 --> 16:40.000
Like, I've seen and smelled things today
that I cannot unsee or unsmell.

16:41.794 --> 16:44.755
- Thanks for covering for me.
- No, I mean he only drinks milk.

16:44.838 --> 16:47.007
Like, where are the colors coming from?

16:51.095 --> 16:53.555
- What time is it?
- Uh, it's almost 6:00.

16:53.639 --> 16:56.850
Okay. Bernadette's gonna be home soon.
We gotta divide and conquer.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.352
I'll make dinner. You watch the kids.

16:58.602 --> 17:00.604
- Kids are asleep.
- Great, then you make dinner.

17:04.775 --> 17:06.193
Hey, good news, Amy.

17:06.944 --> 17:08.320
We got the Athenaeum.

17:08.404 --> 17:11.115
Oh, my gosh. That's amazing.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.158
How'd you get Barry to change his mind?

17:13.283 --> 17:14.910
Well, I couldn't have done it
without Leonard.

17:14.993 --> 17:16.453
Boy, you should've seen us in there.

17:16.537 --> 17:18.122
We were like Batman and Robin.

17:20.124 --> 17:21.291
Why do I have to be Robin?

17:21.583 --> 17:23.335
If you have to ask, you're Robin.

17:25.337 --> 17:26.338
What happened?

17:26.422 --> 17:29.091
Well, we scrubbed out some
barrels of irradiated grease,

17:29.174 --> 17:32.970
rinsed off in a safety shower
and then told Barry Kripke what is what.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.264
And he just gave in?

17:35.389 --> 17:37.266
Well, we agreed to invite him
to the wedding.

17:37.766 --> 17:39.101
Okay. No problem.

17:39.393 --> 17:40.477
And he gets to bring a date.

17:40.936 --> 17:42.104
- Well, that's reasonable.
- Yeah.

17:42.187 --> 17:44.815
And if she charges by the hour,
we have to cover it.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.737
What else did you agree to?

17:50.112 --> 17:53.991
Well, uh, you know
how Barry has the voice of an angel?

17:56.076 --> 17:58.078
He is not singing at our wedding.

17:58.162 --> 18:00.414
He only wants to sing <i>Volare.</i>

18:01.081 --> 18:02.958
Oh, <i>Volare.</i>

18:05.043 --> 18:06.503
That's what he was saying.

18:06.587 --> 18:08.505
Boy, I didn't, I did not get that.

18:09.715 --> 18:12.050
Guys, I appreciate everything you did,

18:12.134 --> 18:14.762
but we can find another location
that's just as good.

18:14.845 --> 18:17.473
Maybe the Japanese garden
or the planetarium.

18:17.723 --> 18:20.976
The planetarium.
I hadn't thought about that.

18:21.059 --> 18:22.227
That's even better.

18:22.478 --> 18:23.562
Wait, what?

18:24.021 --> 18:26.023
I scrubbed sludge for you.

18:26.106 --> 18:29.109
Uh, I may be slightly radioactive.

18:29.693 --> 18:31.403
Oh, you're exaggerating.

18:31.695 --> 18:33.030
Don't let him touch the silverware.

18:40.829 --> 18:42.748
Why is Raj asleep on our couch?

18:43.040 --> 18:44.875
I needed some help so he came by,

18:44.958 --> 18:46.627
played with the kids,
read them some stories,

18:46.710 --> 18:48.587
put them down for their nap
and made dinner.

18:49.922 --> 18:51.048
What'd you do?

18:52.174 --> 18:53.217
Ate dinner.

18:55.344 --> 18:58.096
Okay, look, I don't think I'm cut out
to be a stay-at-home dad.

18:58.347 --> 19:01.266
And since you want to,
you should stay home.

19:01.475 --> 19:03.769
I do definitely want to,

19:03.852 --> 19:06.897
but I know how much this means
to you and it was just one day.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.857
So, don't give up.

19:10.651 --> 19:13.320
You don't want to stay home, either.
Do you?

19:13.612 --> 19:15.155
When I went by the office they gave me

19:15.239 --> 19:17.199
coffee and cookies
and no one peed on me.

19:19.785 --> 19:21.662
I miss that so much.

19:22.412 --> 19:26.708
Well, I love the kids,
but I also love my job.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.877
And sleep.

19:29.419 --> 19:32.089
I know. I took a two-hour nap
on the couch in my office.

19:32.214 --> 19:34.800
I took a three-hour nap on
the floor in the living room.

19:36.176 --> 19:39.221
- How do you feel now?
- Honestly? Still tired.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.015
Me, too.

19:43.058 --> 19:45.227
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

19:45.519 --> 19:46.728
And we'll figure this all out.

19:47.062 --> 19:48.105
Yeah.

19:50.440 --> 19:51.567
Everyone's asleep.

19:52.693 --> 19:54.903
You want to head upstairs and,

19:54.987 --> 19:56.905
you know.

19:58.824 --> 20:00.158
Let's just do it right here.

20:00.576 --> 20:03.120
Oh-oh, I like the way you think.

20:30.856 --> 20:31.857
English - SDH
