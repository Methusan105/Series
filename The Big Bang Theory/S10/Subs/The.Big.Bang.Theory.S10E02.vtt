00:02.295 --> 00:04.381
<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

00:12.555 --> 00:13.765
Hello.

00:14.599 --> 00:16.267
I'm looking for a Howard Wolowitz.

00:16.935 --> 00:18.269
May I ask what this is about?

00:18.436 --> 00:19.688
- No, you may not.
- Oh.

00:20.438 --> 00:21.731
Very well.

00:24.442 --> 00:26.903
Hi, Colonel Williams. How can I help you?

00:28.279 --> 00:30.824
Okay, sure,
I can meet with you on Thursday.

00:31.241 --> 00:35.620
Caltech is fine.
Yeah, and may I ask what this is about?

00:36.788 --> 00:38.039
I may not?

00:38.748 --> 00:40.291
That's what he said to me.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.295
Look at this.

00:44.629 --> 00:46.297
Elon Musk has a theory

00:46.464 --> 00:47.632
that we're all just characters

00:47.799 --> 00:50.510
in some advanced civilization's
video game.

00:50.927 --> 00:52.721
So, some alien kid spent his money

00:52.887 --> 00:55.432
on the asthma and glasses upgrade for me?

00:57.726 --> 01:00.645
Well, he doesn't say it's a good game.

01:02.439 --> 01:04.482
- All right, we got a problem.
- What's up?

01:04.649 --> 01:07.068
The Air Force contacted me
about our quantum gyroscope.

01:07.235 --> 01:08.570
- They wanna have a meeting.
- Really?

01:08.737 --> 01:10.655
Yeah, this military guy
showed up at Howard's door.

01:10.822 --> 01:12.157
He was terrifying.

01:12.323 --> 01:13.491
Oh, what did he say?

01:13.658 --> 01:15.493
He gave me his business card
and asked me to

01:15.660 --> 01:17.746
please pass it along to Howard.

01:19.038 --> 01:21.291
That doesn't sound terrifying.

01:21.708 --> 01:23.668
To a white guy born here, no.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.339
To a brown guy whose name
has a lot of syllables in it,

01:28.506 --> 01:29.841
terrifying.

01:31.468 --> 01:34.179
You realize if the military
declares our research classified,

01:34.429 --> 01:35.472
they can take the whole thing
away from us.

01:35.805 --> 01:38.224
Yeah, and if that happens, we'll never
be able to sell it commercially.

01:38.391 --> 01:39.476
There goes our big payday.

01:39.642 --> 01:41.811
I was counting on that money.
I need to make as much as my wife

01:42.020 --> 01:44.147
so I don't have to try so hard in bed.

01:45.565 --> 01:46.858
- You do that, too?
- Yeah.

01:47.025 --> 01:48.902
How do you think I stay this thin?

01:49.944 --> 01:52.363
Gentlemen, I think we are
losing sight of the real issue.

01:52.697 --> 01:53.907
We are on the precipice

01:54.073 --> 01:55.617
of becoming faceless cogs

01:55.784 --> 01:57.869
in the military-industrial complex.

01:58.203 --> 01:59.537
Isn't that exciting?

02:00.538 --> 02:02.582
- Well, you're kidding, right?
- Not at all.

02:02.749 --> 02:04.000
Look, look... In <i>Star Wars,</i>

02:04.167 --> 02:07.045
when the stormtroopers
would march in perfect formation,

02:07.212 --> 02:08.338
harassing civilians,

02:08.505 --> 02:10.882
didn't you ever think,
"Hey, that could be me"?

02:12.091 --> 02:14.677
Sheldon, we could be contributing
to a weapons system

02:14.844 --> 02:18.181
that oppresses mankind
for the next 1,000 years.

02:18.556 --> 02:20.391
Okay, Howard's on board.
What do you think, Leonard?

02:48.336 --> 02:49.462
I'm worried about Howard.

02:49.629 --> 02:51.130
Ever since that guy
from the Air Force showed up,

02:51.297 --> 02:52.632
he's been a nervous wreck.

02:52.799 --> 02:54.592
All right,
we work at a giant pharmaceutical company.

02:54.759 --> 02:56.177
Get him some anti-anxiety meds.

02:56.344 --> 02:58.179
He won't take any pills
that aren't chewable

02:58.346 --> 03:00.056
and shaped like a Flintstone.

03:01.599 --> 03:02.600
You know,
when Leonard's feeling anxious,

03:02.767 --> 03:04.060
I make him take a long walk.

03:04.602 --> 03:06.437
- Does that help?
- Uh, for a while,

03:06.604 --> 03:08.273
then he comes back.

03:09.649 --> 03:11.442
- I don't believe this.
- What's wrong?

03:12.277 --> 03:15.321
This guy from the office just
congratulated me on being pregnant.

03:15.655 --> 03:17.323
You did already know, right?

03:18.408 --> 03:20.660
No one at the office did.

03:21.035 --> 03:23.288
- Did you tell anyone?
- No, you told me not to.

03:23.580 --> 03:25.915
I bet it was Barbara Chen in retrovirus.

03:26.207 --> 03:28.084
She might've heard me
throwing up one morning.

03:28.251 --> 03:29.419
Ever since she got that hearing aid,

03:29.586 --> 03:31.004
she thinks she's so great.

03:33.506 --> 03:35.133
Why don't you want anyone to know?

03:35.633 --> 03:37.427
Because, I'm up for
a major immunotherapy study

03:37.635 --> 03:40.013
and if they find out I'm pregnant,
they might give it to someone else.

03:40.179 --> 03:41.514
Would they really do that?

03:41.681 --> 03:43.725
I know they would.
They did it to Barbara Chen last year

03:43.892 --> 03:45.351
when I told everyone she was pregnant.

03:49.564 --> 03:50.607
Wait till I Snapchat

03:50.773 --> 03:54.068
that my friends might be working
on a top secret government project.

03:55.945 --> 03:58.156
Are you crazy?
You can't put that on Snapchat.

03:58.990 --> 04:01.826
Fine, I'll put it on Facebook
like a caveman.

04:04.829 --> 04:06.247
You know, maybe before our meeting,

04:06.414 --> 04:07.457
we should talk to a lawyer.

04:07.624 --> 04:08.666
That's not a bad idea.

04:08.833 --> 04:10.835
Yeah, you must have someone
in your family that's a lawyer.

04:11.544 --> 04:13.004
Why? Because I'm Jewish?

04:13.296 --> 04:14.756
That's like me saying,
"Hey, you're Indian.

04:14.923 --> 04:17.175
"Doesn't your cousin
work in a call center?"

04:19.260 --> 04:21.220
My cousin does work in a call center.

04:23.890 --> 04:25.516
And my cousin's a lawyer.

04:27.477 --> 04:29.646
We don't need Howard's cousin.

04:29.854 --> 04:31.189
We have me.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.442
You're not a lawyer, Sheldon,
you're just a know-it-all.

04:34.609 --> 04:35.860
I am not a know-it-all.

04:36.027 --> 04:38.279
I'm a person who knows lots of things

04:38.446 --> 04:41.032
and likes to correct other people
when they're wrong.

04:41.950 --> 04:43.701
That's the definition
of being a know-it-all.

04:44.535 --> 04:46.746
Or in German, a <i>Besserwisser.</i>

04:50.541 --> 04:52.377
How did you think you were
gonna hide your pregnancy?

04:52.669 --> 04:55.463
I had a plan.
I kept leaving DOVEBAR wrappers around

04:55.672 --> 04:57.048
to explain any weight gain.

04:58.675 --> 05:00.927
Where did you get
empty DOVEBAR wrappers?

05:01.302 --> 05:03.137
From all the DOVEBARs I ate.

05:03.346 --> 05:05.098
I'm pregnant, try to keep up!

05:07.976 --> 05:10.561
I'm sorry, I have to go
find out if my boss knows.

05:10.770 --> 05:12.897
Well, whatever happens,
we're here for you.

05:13.064 --> 05:14.148
Thanks, you guys are the best.

05:14.315 --> 05:15.817
Drive safe, we love you,
and give us a call when...

05:15.984 --> 05:17.026
Oh, my God, it was me, it was me.

05:17.193 --> 05:18.528
I'm the one who blabbed she's pregnant!

05:18.987 --> 05:20.238
- What?
<i>- I didn't mean to.</i>

05:20.405 --> 05:22.323
It just slipped out in front of
her assistant one day. I feel...

05:22.490 --> 05:24.575
- Excuse me, I forgot my coat.
- Oh! Here's your coat, honey.

05:24.742 --> 05:26.703
That's such a cute jacket.

05:28.287 --> 05:30.081
God, I feel so bad.
I just lied to her.

05:30.373 --> 05:33.584
Oh, but you did it so well.
That's amazing.

05:34.961 --> 05:36.295
It's like watching a sculptor

05:36.462 --> 05:38.715
but your clay was lies.

05:39.549 --> 05:41.175
Is that really what's important right now?

05:41.384 --> 05:43.386
Seriously, you have got to let me

05:43.553 --> 05:45.013
scan your brain
when you're being dishonest,

05:45.179 --> 05:47.140
so I can see what lights up.

05:47.682 --> 05:49.350
That's just super helpful, Amy.

05:49.517 --> 05:50.643
Thanks a lot, I can't wait to do that.

05:51.602 --> 05:53.855
I can see a clump of bitch cells
lighting up from here.

05:58.484 --> 06:00.903
Gimme a second to call my cousin.

06:01.237 --> 06:04.115
I don't see how a tax lawyer
from Fort Lauderdale

06:04.282 --> 06:06.492
could be helpful
regarding intellectual property.

06:06.659 --> 06:08.453
First of all, he's in Boca Raton

06:08.619 --> 06:10.329
which is better than Fort Lauderdale.

06:11.789 --> 06:12.832
But, more importantly,

06:12.999 --> 06:14.876
he lasted two days on <i>Jeopardy,</i>

06:15.043 --> 06:16.419
so he's clearly a smart guy.

06:20.798 --> 06:21.799
<i>Hello.</i>

06:22.216 --> 06:24.469
Hey, Marty.
Thanks for talking to us.

06:24.635 --> 06:26.387
<i>Yeah, no problem.
Thanks for going to outer space</i>

06:26.554 --> 06:29.474
<i>so no matter what I do
my mom will be disappointed in me.</i>

06:31.100 --> 06:32.477
Well, I married a little Catholic girl,

06:32.643 --> 06:33.853
so, we're even.

06:34.854 --> 06:37.148
Anyway, this is Leonard and Sheldon.
The three of us

06:37.315 --> 06:38.816
- came up with the guidance system.
- Hi.

06:38.983 --> 06:40.401
- Hello.
- And this is my friend, Raj.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.028
Oh, I'm not on the patent.
I'm just here

06:42.195 --> 06:44.489
because there's a bumblebee in my office.

06:46.532 --> 06:48.326
I saw it. It's big.

06:49.827 --> 06:51.370
Anyway, like I said in the email,

06:51.537 --> 06:52.789
this meeting's on Thursday.

06:52.955 --> 06:54.582
Do you have any advice for us?

06:54.749 --> 06:56.501
<i>Well, I don't know much
about patent law.</i>

06:56.918 --> 06:58.336
<i>But my advice is</i>

06:58.544 --> 07:00.963
<i>hear them out,
offer as little information as possible</i>

07:01.130 --> 07:03.382
<i>and whatever you do,
don't sign anything.</i>

07:03.758 --> 07:06.344
Don't sign anything?
That's your advice?

07:06.511 --> 07:08.387
Okay, so, if during this meeting

07:08.554 --> 07:09.847
one of us were to, say,

07:10.014 --> 07:11.474
complete an oil painting,

07:11.641 --> 07:13.893
you'd recommend that
we leave that unsigned?

07:15.686 --> 07:17.396
<i>- That's not what I meant.</i>
- That's what you said.

07:17.563 --> 07:19.148
<i>That's not what I meant.</i>

07:19.357 --> 07:21.400
This must be how you
practice law in Boca Raton.

07:21.567 --> 07:24.362
By saying things you don't mean
and meaning things you don't say.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.531
<i>Howard, why is he yelling at me?</i>

07:28.491 --> 07:29.784
All right, you were on <i>Jeopardy.</i>

07:29.951 --> 07:32.870
Allow me to Alex Trebek this
and put it in the form of a question.

07:33.204 --> 07:35.998
Who has been
a complete waste of our time?

07:38.167 --> 07:39.210
Marty, let me call you back.

07:39.377 --> 07:40.795
Someday, when I'm up on murder charges,

07:40.962 --> 07:42.380
you'll be hearing from me.

07:44.048 --> 07:45.716
You don't need him.
I'll represent you.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.222
- Hi.
- Hey, what brings you by?

07:51.556 --> 07:54.350
Oh! I had to go to a sales seminar
on our new sleeping pill.

07:54.517 --> 07:55.935
- Oh, how was it?
- Great!

07:56.144 --> 07:58.062
- Fall asleep?
- In, like, two minutes.

07:59.397 --> 08:01.065
So, how is everything going around here?

08:01.232 --> 08:03.526
You still upset about people
finding out you're pregnant?

08:03.943 --> 08:05.361
I'm furious.

08:05.945 --> 08:07.405
Sure. Sure.

08:07.572 --> 08:09.657
Uh, did you ever figure out who told?

08:10.032 --> 08:11.784
No. I confronted Barbara Chen,

08:11.951 --> 08:14.120
but she claimed she didn't know
what I was talking about.

08:14.579 --> 08:15.913
Hmm, well, I guess it's just gonna

08:16.080 --> 08:17.790
remain a mystery, you know,

08:17.999 --> 08:21.419
like, whatever happened in that seminar
after they dimmed the lights.

08:22.628 --> 08:23.838
It had to be Barbara.

08:24.005 --> 08:25.882
I've been trying to figure out
a way to get back at her.

08:26.924 --> 08:29.802
Do you think using her work computer
to Google "how to be a prostitute"

08:29.969 --> 08:31.554
is over the line?

08:33.097 --> 08:34.765
Um, you know,
when I was in high school,

08:34.932 --> 08:37.810
there was this girl who was
talking about me behind my back.

08:38.060 --> 08:40.271
So, me and all my friends,
we cornered her in the bathroom

08:40.563 --> 08:41.772
and forgave her.

08:43.900 --> 08:45.151
What kind of revenge is that?

08:45.318 --> 08:47.653
This woman screwed with my job.
She's gotta pay.

08:48.738 --> 08:51.157
Okay. All right, honey, you know what?

08:51.782 --> 08:54.035
There was something I was too scared
to tell you yesterday

08:54.285 --> 08:57.496
and now, I'm just balls-out terrified
to tell you.

08:57.663 --> 08:59.207
But the truth is

08:59.415 --> 09:02.084
it wasn't Barbara Chen, it was me.

09:02.376 --> 09:03.628
I'm the reason everyone knows.

09:04.045 --> 09:06.172
- Why would you do that?
- No. It was an accident.

09:06.339 --> 09:08.174
I am so sorry I lied.

09:09.425 --> 09:10.468
Get out.

09:16.307 --> 09:18.184
Oh, you know, I also

09:18.351 --> 09:19.685
lied about the girl in the bathroom.

09:19.936 --> 09:21.729
Yeah, we actually dunked
her retainer in the toilet

09:21.896 --> 09:23.814
and put it back in her mouth.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.822
I don't understand why
I can't talk at this meeting.

09:32.281 --> 09:34.450
'Cause when you talk,
it enrages people.

09:36.911 --> 09:38.829
Okay. Quick question,

09:38.996 --> 09:41.123
am I allowed to exchange pleasantries

09:41.290 --> 09:42.500
upon meeting this colonel?

09:43.000 --> 09:45.211
- Yes.
- Am I allowed to inform him

09:45.378 --> 09:48.172
that Colonel Sanders was
never actually in the military?

09:49.924 --> 09:51.550
- I'm getting enraged.
- Fine.

09:52.635 --> 09:55.471
Ooh, can I use text-to-speech software?

09:55.638 --> 09:57.181
- No!
- Don't speak.

09:58.849 --> 10:00.142
<i>Aw, nuts.</i>

10:01.477 --> 10:03.062
Gentlemen, I'm Colonel Williams.

10:03.479 --> 10:04.605
Thank you for meeting with me.

10:05.064 --> 10:06.315
- Hi.
- Hello.

10:08.526 --> 10:11.737
So, which one of you is
the brains behind all of this?

10:12.405 --> 10:13.864
It's a group effort,

10:14.031 --> 10:16.492
but I guess if we had to
pick a main brain

10:16.701 --> 10:17.868
that would be me.

10:18.035 --> 10:19.495
Mmm-mmm.

10:28.087 --> 10:30.756
And, because of the quantum vortices
this can run perpetually?

10:30.923 --> 10:33.634
Exactly. Yeah, you have
a good grasp of the physics.

10:33.843 --> 10:35.803
Well, I'm a scientist by training.

10:36.053 --> 10:37.388
Really, you're a physicist?

10:37.555 --> 10:39.015
Better. I'm an engineer.

10:45.563 --> 10:46.939
Where did you go to school?

10:47.106 --> 10:49.734
- MIT.
- What? Hey, me, too.

10:49.900 --> 10:52.778
I should have known. Behind every
great invention is an MIT mind.

10:57.533 --> 10:58.951
I'll cut to the chase.

10:59.160 --> 11:02.413
The Air Force believes there's
an application for this technology

11:02.580 --> 11:04.540
and we're interested
in funding your research.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.793
Well. Thanks, but you should know,

11:08.044 --> 11:10.921
we're a little concerned about
this being used in weapons.

11:11.088 --> 11:13.257
Oh, well,
let me put your mind at ease.

11:13.424 --> 11:15.718
What we use it for is
none of your business.

11:19.263 --> 11:21.098
I don't know how I feel about this.

11:21.557 --> 11:23.434
Look, guys,
it's just a guidance system.

11:23.601 --> 11:26.771
It's not like you're handing us
the Death Star from <i>Star Trek.</i>

11:32.943 --> 11:34.445
All you need to worry about is,

11:34.612 --> 11:36.530
right now it's this big,

11:36.739 --> 11:40.409
and we need it to be this big.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.411
That's a lot less big.

11:43.913 --> 11:47.458
Yes. It's this much less big.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.169
I'm not even sure that's possible.

11:50.753 --> 11:52.588
Well, I ran it by some colleagues at MIT

11:52.755 --> 11:55.091
and they thought they could
get it done in four months.

11:55.299 --> 11:58.052
- Four months?
- Yeah, we'll do it in two!

11:58.803 --> 11:59.970
Hi. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

12:00.137 --> 12:02.431
I'm the actual brains behind this project.

12:02.598 --> 12:04.475
Also, engineers aren't real scientists,

12:04.642 --> 12:05.935
MIT's a trade school,

12:06.143 --> 12:08.896
and the Death Star
is from <i>Star Wars</i>, not <i>Star Trek.</i>

12:10.481 --> 12:12.483
Otherwise, thank you for your service.

12:19.698 --> 12:21.742
Hi, Howard told me
you were working late,

12:21.909 --> 12:23.994
- so I brought dinner.
- Oh, thanks.

12:24.161 --> 12:25.454
You know, I just wanted
to get some work done

12:25.621 --> 12:26.956
without people congratulating me

12:27.123 --> 12:28.457
about the baby every five minutes.

12:28.624 --> 12:31.961
I spent my day alone in the lab
waiting for a rat to die of anthrax.

12:33.963 --> 12:36.257
Did you come here to
bring me dinner or to gloat?

12:37.883 --> 12:39.635
Well, I came to see how you were feeling

12:39.802 --> 12:41.971
but I'm guessing still angry?

12:42.179 --> 12:45.349
I'm sorry, my boss wants to meet with me
and I'm stressing.

12:45.891 --> 12:47.852
You really think they're gonna
start treating you differently?

12:48.227 --> 12:51.272
Are you kidding?
I've always been treated differently!

12:51.439 --> 12:53.649
Look at me! Listen to me!

12:53.816 --> 12:56.152
I mean, the first thought
when you see me isn't,

12:56.318 --> 12:57.361
"That's a scientist,"

12:57.570 --> 13:00.197
it's, "I wonder if her mommy
knows where she is."

13:02.867 --> 13:05.369
I am really regretting that
I got you a Happy Meal.

13:09.415 --> 13:11.167
I've worked so hard to get where I am,

13:11.333 --> 13:13.377
and I don't want to get
sent back to square one

13:13.544 --> 13:14.962
because I'm pregnant.

13:15.296 --> 13:16.589
I understand how you feel.

13:17.256 --> 13:18.340
Thank you.

13:18.507 --> 13:20.926
I wish there was some way
I could make it better.

13:21.135 --> 13:23.387
Well, you brought me French fries,
that's a start.

13:24.221 --> 13:27.391
Uh, actually I got you apple slices,
'cause you're pregnant.

13:29.602 --> 13:30.853
Apple slices?

13:31.395 --> 13:34.315
What kind of lunatic goes to McDonald's
and gets fruit?

13:34.565 --> 13:36.609
I'll be right back.

13:37.193 --> 13:38.235
And a chocolate shake!

13:44.783 --> 13:46.202
- Hi.
<i>- Hello.</i>

13:47.077 --> 13:49.371
- What are you doing?
- Oh, Leonard's mad at me

13:49.538 --> 13:50.956
so I'm making him lemon bars.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.251
Does he even like lemon bars?

13:54.418 --> 13:56.045
Hmm, not really.

13:56.754 --> 13:58.172
But I'm mad at him, too,

13:58.380 --> 13:59.507
so, lemon bars it is.

14:01.258 --> 14:02.426
Something happen at the meeting?

14:02.843 --> 14:04.803
They made me promise I wouldn't talk.

14:05.262 --> 14:06.639
- And you talked.
- Well now, see?

14:06.805 --> 14:09.225
You knew what was gonna happen,
why didn't they?

14:10.309 --> 14:12.102
Anyway, now we're committed
to completing this project

14:12.269 --> 14:13.938
in a ridiculously short time frame

14:14.104 --> 14:15.564
and everyone's upset with me.

14:16.148 --> 14:18.901
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
Bernadette's mad at me, too.

14:19.276 --> 14:21.278
Mmm. If it makes you feel any better,

14:21.445 --> 14:22.780
a parasitoid wasp

14:22.947 --> 14:24.365
known as Oobius depressus

14:24.532 --> 14:26.784
has been rediscovered after 101 years

14:26.951 --> 14:28.369
of presumed extinction.

14:30.621 --> 14:32.289
Why would that make me feel better?

14:32.456 --> 14:34.750
Well, why would your Bernadette thing
make me feel better?

14:35.876 --> 14:38.254
- At least mine was educational.
- Okay.

14:38.462 --> 14:40.798
- Never mind.
- Look, I'm sorry.

14:41.090 --> 14:43.300
Tell me why
Bernadette is upset with you.

14:44.301 --> 14:46.387
Well, I told people at work
that she's pregnant.

14:46.554 --> 14:48.097
She wasn't ready for them to know.

14:48.597 --> 14:50.724
- Why would you do that?
- Well, it just slipped out.

14:50.933 --> 14:53.852
- I feel terrible.
- See, that's exactly what happened to me.

14:54.019 --> 14:56.814
Except that I said it on purpose
and I have no regrets.

14:59.775 --> 15:01.986
Is it even possible to get
this done in two months?

15:02.152 --> 15:03.696
Maybe, I don't know.
We'll have to work

15:03.862 --> 15:05.656
12 hours a day, seven days a week.

15:05.823 --> 15:08.075
Which means I won't be able
to make Penny breakfast every day,

15:08.242 --> 15:10.160
and she'll realize my brioche French toast

15:10.327 --> 15:12.705
was the only thing
keeping her in the marriage.

15:13.664 --> 15:15.916
- I love your French toast.
- Oh, thanks, man.

15:17.501 --> 15:19.962
So, why did you guys
even agree to the deadline?

15:20.129 --> 15:21.505
We didn't, Sheldon did.

15:21.672 --> 15:23.173
And you just let him?

15:23.340 --> 15:25.009
Well, the colonel said it was
for the good of the country

15:25.175 --> 15:26.677
and the funding is substantial...

15:26.844 --> 15:28.429
But, mostly there was an awkward pause

15:28.596 --> 15:31.181
and I broke it by saying, "Okay."

15:33.017 --> 15:35.603
So, I guess I won't be
seeing you guys for a while.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.146
Oh, looks like it.

15:37.313 --> 15:39.481
Wow, you're going off
to work with the military

15:39.648 --> 15:40.816
leaving me behind.

15:40.983 --> 15:43.444
Now, I know how all those army wives feel.

15:44.903 --> 15:48.073
Would you stop? We're just
gonna be on the other side of campus.

15:48.240 --> 15:49.867
And, right here.

15:52.202 --> 15:54.371
You are a deeply silly man.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.751
He is so afraid of his feelings.

16:04.381 --> 16:05.716
Oh, hi.

16:05.966 --> 16:08.052
- Got a minute?
- Yeah. Come on in.

16:10.888 --> 16:12.348
I just wanted to apologize.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.725
I know what you did was an accident.

16:15.142 --> 16:18.062
Oh, thank you.
And I'm sorry I lied about it.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.064
Well, for what it's worth,
you're a great liar.

16:20.397 --> 16:22.358
Aw, that's what Amy said.

16:24.443 --> 16:25.736
So, what's going on
with the research project?

16:25.903 --> 16:27.154
Are they going to let you run it?

16:27.321 --> 16:29.323
Well, my boss said
he hadn't decided yet.

16:29.490 --> 16:32.201
So, I gently reminded him
that he's an old rich white guy

16:32.368 --> 16:33.744
and I'm a sweet little pregnant lady

16:33.911 --> 16:36.121
who's not afraid to cry
in front of a jury.

16:38.165 --> 16:39.500
You threatened to sue?

16:39.917 --> 16:41.543
Hey, I learned a long time ago

16:41.710 --> 16:44.338
when you're 4'11"
and eye level with every guy's crotch,

16:44.588 --> 16:46.632
that's where you punch.

16:48.175 --> 16:51.303
That's funny,
I learned something totally different.

16:53.806 --> 16:56.183
You know what?
It's just a research project.

16:56.350 --> 16:59.436
The most important job in the world
is gonna be raising this child.

16:59.603 --> 17:01.397
It's all I need to give my life meaning.

17:01.605 --> 17:03.440
Aw, that's so beautiful.

17:03.774 --> 17:05.192
You believe me? Oh, good.

17:05.442 --> 17:08.445
Eleven more chumps like you,
I'll have the jury eating out of my hand.

17:11.615 --> 17:14.576
I never realized
this building was classified.

17:14.785 --> 17:17.454
Maybe that's because it's classified.

17:20.249 --> 17:22.626
Wish we weren't so far
from my parking space.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.378
The way you put away
those lemon bars,

17:24.545 --> 17:26.130
perhaps that's a good thing.

17:27.631 --> 17:29.633
I'd like to reinstate
the "you not talking" rule.

17:30.175 --> 17:32.094
Why? It clearly doesn't work.

17:35.013 --> 17:36.473
I guess this is it.

17:36.765 --> 17:38.142
<i>Is that a retinal scanner?</i>
