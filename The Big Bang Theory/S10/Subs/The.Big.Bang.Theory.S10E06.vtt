WEBVTT

00:03.880 --> 00:06.049
Hey, have you ever heard
of Van Nuys Comic-Con?

00:06.216 --> 00:09.469
Yeah, it's a dinky little convention
where they sell collectibles

00:09.636 --> 00:11.971
and get sad D-list celebrities to appear.
Why?

00:12.138 --> 00:13.932
I got asked to sign autographs there.

00:14.557 --> 00:16.226
That's awesome!

00:17.727 --> 00:19.104
Is this for <i>Serial Ape-ist?</i>

00:19.270 --> 00:22.065
Well, could be for the monkey movie,
it could be my hemorrhoid commercial.

00:22.232 --> 00:23.566
The list does not go on.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.611
- When is it?
- It doesn't matter, I'm not doing it.

00:26.778 --> 00:29.322
- What? Why not?
- You just said yourself, it's sad.

00:29.489 --> 00:32.283
Yeah, but it's not pathetic.
That's where I draw the line.

00:33.785 --> 00:36.204
- Come on. We'll have fun.
- I don't know.

00:36.371 --> 00:38.581
You'll have nerds fawning all over you.

00:38.748 --> 00:41.126
If you don't love that,
this marriage is in trouble.

00:41.793 --> 00:44.754
Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt to meet
some fans and make a little extra money.

00:44.921 --> 00:46.005
Yeah.

00:46.172 --> 00:47.298
Oh, wow.

00:47.465 --> 00:51.136
An appearance
by George Lucas's dermatologist.

00:53.138 --> 00:55.432
- I want that autograph.
- Oh, yeah.

01:22.333 --> 01:26.546
You know, with us living together, maybe
we could think about having people over.

01:26.713 --> 01:28.298
We have people over all the time.

01:28.798 --> 01:31.885
We have the maintenance people,
the pizza delivery man,

01:32.552 --> 01:35.889
that UPS driver who feels the need to ask
how parts of me are hanging.

01:37.891 --> 01:38.892
You know what I meant.

01:39.434 --> 01:40.852
All right. Fine.

01:41.019 --> 01:43.188
Let's say that we were
to entertain people.

01:43.354 --> 01:45.106
What type of gathering
did you have in mind?

01:45.315 --> 01:49.235
A meal? Lunch? Brunch? Dinner?
Afternoon tea? A formal tea?

01:49.402 --> 01:51.529
Is it a party?
And if so, what kind of party is it?

01:51.696 --> 01:54.199
Cocktail party? A Tupperware party?

01:55.074 --> 01:57.202
Is it a surprise party?

01:58.203 --> 01:59.621
Oh, I hope it's not a West Coast party.

01:59.788 --> 02:03.708
'Cause according to the man on the radio,
a west coast party don't stop.

02:04.250 --> 02:05.543
I'm sorry I mentioned it.

02:05.710 --> 02:08.087
Oh, don't be. You get your hopes up,
I knock them down,

02:08.254 --> 02:09.672
that's called teamwork.

02:19.724 --> 02:22.435
That's a kick, that's an actual kick.

02:28.149 --> 02:29.526
What are you doing?

02:30.902 --> 02:32.237
I felt a kick.

02:32.737 --> 02:34.239
There's a baby in there.

02:35.990 --> 02:38.368
Oh, yeah. That's where I put it.

02:39.452 --> 02:41.788
No, I mean,
I know you're pregnant.

02:42.080 --> 02:46.084
I just never connected
the idea of pregnancy

02:46.876 --> 02:49.379
and you actually having a baby.

02:50.755 --> 02:52.924
Which MIT did you go to?

02:57.011 --> 03:00.181
Oh, God, we are not ready to have
an infant in this house.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.559
We don't have a crib.
We don't have diapers.

03:02.725 --> 03:04.143
We're not baby-proofed.

03:04.310 --> 03:07.522
Anyone can just walk in off the street
and lift our toilet lids.

03:08.356 --> 03:10.608
Howie, we have time to do all that stuff.

03:10.775 --> 03:12.360
Do we? Look at you.

03:12.527 --> 03:15.280
Willy Wonka would roll you
to the juicing room.

03:17.824 --> 03:20.827
The next person kicking you will be me,
good night.

03:28.918 --> 03:30.295
Are we even in a good school... Ow!

03:32.922 --> 03:34.966
I warned you and I did it.

03:39.804 --> 03:40.847
What's all this?

03:41.014 --> 03:43.224
Oh, everything we need for
your autograph session.

03:43.725 --> 03:44.767
Headshots, markers.

03:44.934 --> 03:46.603
Okay, Leonard,
it's sweet you're excited about this,

03:46.769 --> 03:49.314
but it'll be a miracle
if one person asks for my autograph.

03:49.480 --> 03:52.817
Are you kidding? I once paid $20
for Theo Sassler's signature.

03:53.026 --> 03:54.152
Who's that?

03:54.319 --> 03:56.946
I don't even know. I just liked his name.
Theo Sassler.

03:58.406 --> 04:01.409
Oh, and look at this,
I even got a change maker.

04:06.122 --> 04:07.999
How much change you want, little lady?

04:09.751 --> 04:11.711
Oh, there's so much I want to change.

04:13.546 --> 04:15.882
Yeah, well, if it's a dollar,
you're in luck.

04:21.930 --> 04:23.306
What's going on here?

04:23.765 --> 04:26.142
You expressed an interest
in having people over

04:26.309 --> 04:28.519
and I feel I dismissed it too quickly.

04:28.770 --> 04:32.649
So, I took matters into my own hands
and I arranged a brunch.

04:33.524 --> 04:36.110
That's so nice, who's coming?

04:36.277 --> 04:39.364
Oh, uh, Stuart,
uh, Bert from the geology lab

04:39.530 --> 04:41.532
and Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.

04:41.699 --> 04:43.534
You mean the Romanian lady
on the second floor?

04:43.701 --> 04:45.536
Yes. Oh, fun story.

04:45.703 --> 04:47.872
She grew up with 10 siblings

04:48.039 --> 04:50.416
or possibly penguins,
her English is atrocious.

04:52.418 --> 04:54.045
That's an odd mix of people.

04:54.212 --> 04:55.838
Well, for our first time hosting

04:56.005 --> 04:58.132
I thought it would be wise
to conduct a trial run.

04:58.424 --> 05:01.094
You know, like how I practiced
for that Halloween haunted house

05:01.260 --> 05:04.389
by going into the bathroom
at the bus station.

05:05.056 --> 05:06.557
But you never went into that
haunted house.

05:06.724 --> 05:08.935
You never saw what jumped out at me
at the bus station.

05:11.062 --> 05:13.731
Well, thank you, Sheldon,
this is a fun surprise.

05:13.940 --> 05:16.526
Aw, well, the real surprise
is how surprised

05:16.693 --> 05:18.444
you are that I'm great at surprises.

05:18.861 --> 05:20.738
Well, that's not a surprise at all.

05:20.947 --> 05:22.532
I mean, if I knew you were good
at surprises,

05:22.699 --> 05:25.410
I would've expected the surprise
and therefore not have been surprised.

05:25.576 --> 05:29.664
But as it is I didn't know and therefore
my surprise should be unsurprising.

05:30.915 --> 05:34.127
Don't get me all randy,
guests are on the way.

05:38.047 --> 05:39.757
- Hi.
- Hey, where you been?

05:39.924 --> 05:42.093
We went and did a little shopping
for the baby.

05:42.260 --> 05:44.262
Wait till you see the crib we found.

05:44.929 --> 05:46.264
You bought a crib without me?

05:46.514 --> 05:47.932
- You're gonna love it.
- Yeah.

05:48.099 --> 05:50.935
It's the highest rated one on the market.
I wouldn't even call it a crib.

05:51.102 --> 05:53.896
I'd call it a
"Fortress of Solitude for babies."

05:56.149 --> 05:57.316
Sounds expensive.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.402
Okay, well,
I may have gone a bit overboard,

05:59.610 --> 06:01.571
but you can't put a price on safety.

06:01.738 --> 06:04.615
Though if you did, it's more zeroes
than you're expecting.

06:06.034 --> 06:07.994
But it's the safest crib you can buy.

06:08.161 --> 06:10.705
- If you don't like it we can return it.
- Fine.

06:10.872 --> 06:12.957
In our new minivan, hey what's for lunch?

06:14.250 --> 06:15.376
You bought a minivan?

06:15.877 --> 06:17.837
It's for the baby. And I didn't buy it.

06:18.004 --> 06:20.631
The dealer loaned to me for
a 24-hour test-drive.

06:20.840 --> 06:23.134
Though we did ding up the back pretty
good with the crib,

06:23.301 --> 06:24.552
so you might've bought a minivan.

06:26.763 --> 06:29.057
I don't wanna drive that,
it's such a mom car.

06:29.432 --> 06:32.685
The guy at the dealership said
they're not just for moms anymore.

06:33.436 --> 06:36.064
Then again, he did think you were
my husband.

06:39.484 --> 06:42.153
They thought it at the ultrasound,
why not at the car dealership?

06:48.659 --> 06:50.703
Never been on this side
of the table before.

06:51.496 --> 06:52.789
Feel powerful.

06:53.706 --> 06:54.707
Really?

06:54.874 --> 06:57.835
Feel like I'm selling candy
so our team can get new uniforms.

06:59.003 --> 07:01.714
Okay, so it's $4.75
for a signed black and white

07:01.881 --> 07:02.882
and $9.95 for color.

07:03.174 --> 07:04.926
All right. Why not five and 10 bucks?

07:05.343 --> 07:07.595
I brought my moneymaker, let me shake it.

07:09.806 --> 07:11.182
Hey, that guy's looking over here.

07:11.349 --> 07:13.434
Oh, think he's your first autograph?

07:13.601 --> 07:15.311
I don't know. Be cool.
He's coming. He's coming.

07:15.561 --> 07:16.604
Hi.

07:16.771 --> 07:19.315
- Hi. I love your movie.
- Oh, thanks.

07:19.482 --> 07:22.944
It has got to be one of the worst things
I've ever seen in my life.

07:24.195 --> 07:26.030
Your love confuses me.

07:28.241 --> 07:29.951
- Would you like an autograph?
- Sure.

07:30.118 --> 07:31.410
- Okay, who do I make it out to?
- Daniel.

07:31.577 --> 07:33.079
- Okay.
- I have to ask,

07:33.412 --> 07:36.874
were you trying to be that bad
or are you just a terrible actress?

07:38.376 --> 07:40.169
That did not clear things up.

07:44.173 --> 07:45.883
That'll be $4.75.

07:46.342 --> 07:48.219
- Keep the change.
- But, I... Oh.

07:56.602 --> 07:59.188
- Nothing about that was good.
- Mmm-mmm.

08:01.023 --> 08:02.733
There's nothing to be afraid of, Sheldon.

08:05.570 --> 08:08.573
The average cork speed
is 25 miles per hour.

08:09.240 --> 08:12.368
If that is too fast around a school,
it is certainly too fast around a kitchen.

08:15.913 --> 08:17.206
Been 15 minutes, just sayin'.

08:17.665 --> 08:20.877
Oh, gosh. I can do this.
Just give me a moment...

08:21.085 --> 08:22.879
Mommy!

08:24.088 --> 08:25.590
Mimosas coming up.

08:26.382 --> 08:30.386
I once left orange juice in my fridge
so long it tasted like a mimosa.

08:31.804 --> 08:33.097
How old was it?

08:33.264 --> 08:34.432
It's hard to say.

08:34.599 --> 08:36.475
I don't remember much after I drank it.

08:38.728 --> 08:41.272
- Would you like one, Mrs. Petrescu?
- Yes.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.024
Drink is fun and good friends...

08:43.274 --> 08:44.609
Applebee's.

08:47.361 --> 08:49.280
She's learning English from TV.

08:49.947 --> 08:52.533
TV, good. Now back to you.

08:55.411 --> 08:57.038
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Stuart.

08:57.246 --> 08:59.790
- These are for you.
- Oh, they're pretty. Thank you.

08:59.999 --> 09:03.044
Stuart, this is Bert
from the Caltech geology lab

09:03.211 --> 09:05.129
and this is Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.

09:05.296 --> 09:06.714
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

09:06.881 --> 09:08.674
- Hey.
- So, what did I miss?

09:08.966 --> 09:12.595
Yeah, we watched Sheldon try to open
a bottle for 15 minutes.

09:14.138 --> 09:18.184
Fifteen minutes can save you fifteen
percent or more on car insurance.

09:22.855 --> 09:24.232
Anybody else coming to this thing?

09:31.197 --> 09:33.199
- What's your name? Okay.
- Jeff.

09:33.658 --> 09:35.368
My favorite part is your shower scene.

09:36.035 --> 09:37.703
Been hearing that a lot today.

09:38.412 --> 09:40.289
I even have a screen grab on my phone.

09:41.082 --> 09:43.125
Yep, there they are.

09:44.543 --> 09:46.837
- Okay, let's keep it moving.
- Here you go.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.174
Should have punched that guy.

09:50.341 --> 09:51.676
Oh. Go ahead. He's right over there.

09:52.176 --> 09:54.470
Why do you do that?
Can't you let me have my moment?

09:56.806 --> 09:59.183
- Hello.
- Hi, I like your movies.

09:59.350 --> 10:01.060
- Thank you.
- I saw both of them.

10:01.477 --> 10:04.981
I assume we're still talking about the
movies, but after today, who knows.

10:05.982 --> 10:08.401
- You think I could get a picture of us?
- Oh, sure.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.194
And, could you be giving me a kiss?

10:10.361 --> 10:13.072
No. She cannot...
What is wrong with you people?

10:13.322 --> 10:15.199
- Leonard.
- No, no, no. It's not okay.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.034
- Who are you?
- I'm her husband.

10:18.703 --> 10:20.705
No you're not.

10:22.707 --> 10:24.709
- I am.
- Yeah. He really is.

10:27.753 --> 10:28.879
No.

10:31.966 --> 10:35.219
It's got a rear-view camera,
there's a DVD player.

10:35.386 --> 10:36.887
And check this out...

10:38.723 --> 10:40.725
It's like we're living in the future!

10:41.934 --> 10:44.186
Hey, show her the trunk.
Show her the trunk.

10:44.437 --> 10:45.563
Imagine this.

10:45.730 --> 10:48.399
You've got the baby in one hand,

10:48.899 --> 10:51.152
groceries in the other,
and you're thinking,

10:52.028 --> 10:53.988
"How am I gonna open this trunk?"

10:55.156 --> 10:58.868
I'm probably thinking, "Where's my husband
and why isn't he helping me?"

10:59.827 --> 11:01.120
You don't need my help

11:01.329 --> 11:04.248
when you can open the trunk
with a simple kick of the foot.

11:10.671 --> 11:13.007
No. It's a gentle kick,
you're doing it wrong.

11:13.215 --> 11:14.592
Here, give me those.

11:21.807 --> 11:23.934
You know, maybe it was more of a circle...

11:27.146 --> 11:29.357
It's weird that guy thought
you were a couple.

11:31.275 --> 11:32.443
- Yes!
- Yes!

11:32.651 --> 11:34.236
See? Easy.

11:34.612 --> 11:36.113
Look at all this cargo space.

11:36.405 --> 11:38.866
You know, we'll get the crib out
and you can take it for a test drive.

11:39.033 --> 11:42.119
I'm telling you this,
hang on, is gonna be...

11:44.413 --> 11:46.040
Oh, is it your back?

11:46.207 --> 11:47.792
Yeah.

11:49.251 --> 11:51.462
Anyway, let's just get in and see if the

11:51.629 --> 11:54.298
GPS can take us to the nearest
emergency room.

11:57.551 --> 12:01.889
So, until Amy's apartment is fixed,
she and I are living here together.

12:02.139 --> 12:03.849
I lived with my old girlfriend.

12:04.183 --> 12:05.935
She was a geologist, too.

12:06.185 --> 12:07.311
Things didn't work out?

12:07.812 --> 12:10.481
I came home from work one day
and she had taken everything.

12:11.232 --> 12:12.441
I'm warning you.

12:12.608 --> 12:14.360
Hide your good rocks.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.989
My sister's husband
took all her things too.

12:19.156 --> 12:20.366
Story at 11:00.

12:23.661 --> 12:25.329
Really, no one else is coming?

12:27.081 --> 12:29.792
This is it. You are the practice round.

12:30.292 --> 12:31.544
Practice round? For what?

12:32.586 --> 12:35.840
No. He just means that you were
the first people we thought of.

12:36.006 --> 12:37.091
No, exactly.

12:37.258 --> 12:40.428
We've never thrown a brunch before
and I wanted to work out all the kinks.

12:41.554 --> 12:45.433
So, I'm like a lab rat
before your real friends come over?

12:47.893 --> 12:49.103
Mmm.

12:50.354 --> 12:53.357
You see, your words sound reasonable
but your face looks angry.

12:55.651 --> 12:58.529
Help me out, here.
This is not where I shine.

12:58.696 --> 13:01.073
Stuart, you know you're one of
our favorite people.

13:01.240 --> 13:04.577
Okay. Now, see you look sincere
but your words are completely false.

13:05.995 --> 13:08.789
I'm glad we did the test run.
These brunches are wild.

13:12.209 --> 13:14.086
But how did you get her
to go out with you?

13:14.253 --> 13:16.213
Well, she moved in across the hall.

13:16.380 --> 13:19.008
And he started to slowly wear me down.

13:19.925 --> 13:21.552
Like a river carves a canyon.

13:22.761 --> 13:25.764
Yeah. Except the river
kept showing me his Pokemon cards.

13:27.808 --> 13:28.893
Ready to go?

13:29.059 --> 13:32.104
Hang on. This guy's telling me how he got
the <i>Serial Ape-ist</i> girl to marry him.

13:32.605 --> 13:33.606
This guy?

13:34.940 --> 13:36.734
But he's wearing a change maker.

13:38.569 --> 13:40.196
I think it's hot.

13:42.198 --> 13:43.199
That's right.

13:43.365 --> 13:45.034
I'm her change-daddy.

13:51.582 --> 13:53.292
What was I thinking?

13:53.459 --> 13:55.586
Wolowitz's are not a lifting people.

13:55.753 --> 13:57.171
We tip the lifting people.

14:00.090 --> 14:02.801
Do we really have to sit for hours
in the emergency room?

14:02.968 --> 14:05.054
They're just gonna give you ice
and Advil like last time.

14:05.221 --> 14:07.806
You're gonna feel terrible
when I'm in a wheelchair.

14:10.017 --> 14:13.771
Which, by the way, would fit easily in the
back of this award-winning minivan.

14:14.855 --> 14:18.025
Fine. We'll go to the ER.
Just stop selling me on the van.

14:18.192 --> 14:20.110
You're right. It sells itself.

14:22.154 --> 14:23.948
You have to admit,
it is a pretty smooth ride.

14:24.114 --> 14:25.783
I was hoping it'd be quieter.

14:27.034 --> 14:30.287
If child birth is half this bad
you are so screwed!

14:32.289 --> 14:34.166
- Are we there yet?
- Soon.

14:34.375 --> 14:36.168
Why is it taking so long?

14:36.335 --> 14:38.295
Howard, Howard, look at the DVD screen.

14:38.462 --> 14:40.464
I've put on <i>Batman The Animated Series.</i>
Your favorite.

14:40.631 --> 14:43.300
I'm in too much pain to watch...

14:43.467 --> 14:45.261
Oh, this is a good one.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.056
I've been babysitting him way longer
than you have.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.310
Fine. I'll buy the stupid van.

14:57.022 --> 14:59.108
This is the best blintz I've ever had.

14:59.275 --> 15:00.484
Oh, thank you.

15:01.110 --> 15:04.905
It almost makes up for the incredibly
awkward turn things took earlier.

15:06.782 --> 15:08.659
You know what, I think I'm just gonna go.

15:08.826 --> 15:10.160
No, Stuart. Don't.

15:10.327 --> 15:13.831
You know, I consider you
and Sheldon like my family

15:13.998 --> 15:15.833
and I'm not even sure
you think of me as a friend.

15:16.250 --> 15:17.876
You have any idea how that feels?

15:18.627 --> 15:20.045
We're so sorry.

15:20.254 --> 15:22.548
You know, I'm always the last one
anybody thinks of.

15:22.840 --> 15:24.425
Well, that's not true.

15:24.592 --> 15:26.468
Sometimes it's Koothrappali.

15:27.928 --> 15:31.015
Although we're not supposed to say
that 'cause he's a minority.

15:32.391 --> 15:34.893
- Bye.
- No, Stuart. Wait.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.189
I do know what it feels like
to be left out.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.025
I know how it feels, too.

15:41.233 --> 15:43.736
All right. This is about me and him,
you're not a part of it.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.197
Stuart,

15:47.781 --> 15:51.243
perhaps we do take you for granted
and that is not acceptable.

15:51.410 --> 15:55.331
Please know that you truly are
a valuable member of our social group.

15:56.290 --> 15:58.208
- Thank you.
- You know, in fact.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.710
I'd like to propose a toast.

16:03.922 --> 16:05.174
To Stuart.

16:05.841 --> 16:08.552
A fine man, a good friend

16:09.053 --> 16:10.763
and a wonderful guest.

16:11.180 --> 16:12.431
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

16:12.598 --> 16:15.559
<i>Cheers.</i>
Filmed before a live studio audience.

16:20.439 --> 16:23.734
And that is how a short,
asthmatic scientist

16:24.068 --> 16:25.569
landed a stone cold fox.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.488
Whoa!

16:30.115 --> 16:32.242
I didn't know you could propose
to the same person

16:32.409 --> 16:34.203
so many times.

16:35.245 --> 16:38.248
The third time, I did it in sky writing
but she never looked up.

16:39.583 --> 16:42.461
- You know, once I proposed to him.
- Yeah. I said no.

16:43.587 --> 16:46.256
- Why?
- Wanted to make her work for it.

16:47.758 --> 16:50.219
Yeah, that's gonna cost you later.

16:51.053 --> 16:53.472
Hang on.
Is she just with you because you're rich?

16:53.681 --> 16:55.557
She makes more money than I do!

16:56.934 --> 16:58.394
Who are you?

17:04.441 --> 17:06.985
Do you know
what else I love about you, hmm?

17:07.152 --> 17:10.072
Your handwriting is impeccable.

17:11.782 --> 17:14.076
- Thank you for noticing!
- No, I mean it, I mean it.

17:14.243 --> 17:16.954
It's like you have the soul
of a label maker.

17:18.872 --> 17:20.791
You know what I love about you?

17:21.291 --> 17:23.502
You never leave the house
without a paperclip.

17:24.712 --> 17:28.382
'Cause you never know when two pieces
of paper might temporarily need fastening

17:28.549 --> 17:30.092
in the top-left corner.

17:33.637 --> 17:36.849
I also love how you never use swear words.

17:37.015 --> 17:38.142
You know, it turns out

17:38.475 --> 17:41.395
you can hurt people just as well
without 'em.

17:44.606 --> 17:47.234
Maybe I can get a little help putting
some of this stuff away.

17:47.443 --> 17:49.319
Oh... Calm down.

17:49.486 --> 17:51.321
I already put away five of these.

17:53.282 --> 17:56.744
You see?
No muss, no fuss, not a single cuss.

18:29.443 --> 18:30.444
