WEBVTT

00:04.255 --> 00:05.674
Hey, can you help me
put some of the food out?

00:05.840 --> 00:07.592
Yeah, let me finish packing this stuff up.

00:07.759 --> 00:09.844
You know how Sheldon is
if he sees Christmas stuff

00:10.011 --> 00:11.137
lying around after New Year's.

00:11.471 --> 00:13.098
Yeah, but he doesn't live here anymore.

00:13.264 --> 00:15.934
He doesn't live at Walmart.
But he still threw a tantrum

00:16.101 --> 00:18.269
when he saw
Marshmallow Peeps after Easter.

00:19.896 --> 00:21.564
And that's the same man who complains

00:21.731 --> 00:23.817
you can't find
Marshmallow Peeps after Easter.

00:26.611 --> 00:28.613
Oh, it's Bernadette.
She says they're running late.

00:28.947 --> 00:31.908
"The baby threw up on Howard
and then Howard threw up on Howard."

00:33.952 --> 00:35.954
Well, he didn't throw up on the baby.
That's a win.

00:37.330 --> 00:38.373
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:38.540 --> 00:40.500
Hi! Welcome back! How was Texas?

00:41.042 --> 00:44.713
Oh, you know, the Lone Star State.
That should be its Yelp rating.

00:46.506 --> 00:47.674
It was not a great trip.

00:48.007 --> 00:50.552
- Well, you're home now.
- Yeah, it is good to be home.

00:50.719 --> 00:53.388
Good Lord! Is that mistletoe?

00:54.055 --> 00:55.682
Don't you maniacs own a calendar?

00:56.641 --> 00:58.852
I told him to take it down.
He would not listen to me.

01:27.839 --> 01:29.591
Did you at least have
a good flight down there?

01:30.008 --> 01:33.178
It was fine. And other than the
weird-tasting juice Amy gave me,

01:33.344 --> 01:34.512
I slept the whole way.

01:36.848 --> 01:38.600
So, what happened in Texas
that was so bad?

01:38.850 --> 01:41.686
And before our next drive to Comic-Con,
I need the name of that juice.

01:43.688 --> 01:45.899
Well, we were on our way
to my mother's house...

01:49.277 --> 01:51.070
How did we get in the car?

01:52.906 --> 01:54.532
Hold on.

01:54.699 --> 01:56.201
How did you get him in the car?

01:56.785 --> 01:59.454
I rented one of those carts,
pushed him toward the open door

01:59.662 --> 02:01.414
and, just let inertia
take care of the rest.

02:06.294 --> 02:07.629
So, while we're at your mother's house,

02:07.796 --> 02:10.381
it might be a good time to tell her
that we're living together.

02:11.633 --> 02:13.051
Do we have to?

02:13.593 --> 02:15.720
I really don't want to hear
the religious lecture.

02:16.554 --> 02:17.764
Maybe there won't be one.

02:18.681 --> 02:20.141
There's always one.

02:20.683 --> 02:22.852
She gave it to my sister
about her boyfriend.

02:23.061 --> 02:24.854
My brother about his girlfriend.

02:25.063 --> 02:26.898
My father about his girlfriend.

02:29.067 --> 02:31.236
That one had some
un-Christian words in it.

02:33.238 --> 02:34.489
Well, she likes me.

02:34.823 --> 02:36.699
There's a chance
she might be okay with it.

02:37.534 --> 02:38.743
I don't know.

02:39.035 --> 02:40.745
I am her precious little boy,

02:41.079 --> 02:42.622
and you did take my flower.

02:47.377 --> 02:48.586
Do boys have flowers?

02:51.923 --> 02:53.508
Who knows what he has down there.

02:54.884 --> 02:55.969
Anyway...

02:56.594 --> 02:58.721
Thank you, God, for the food
that we are about to receive

02:58.888 --> 03:00.723
and for the nourishment of our bodies

03:00.890 --> 03:03.476
and bless the hands
that prepared it. Amen.

03:05.937 --> 03:09.065
Given that your hands prepared it,
isn't that a little self-serving?

03:10.692 --> 03:12.443
You start changing
the words to the prayers,

03:12.610 --> 03:15.321
next thing you know,
you're in a church with a guitar.

03:18.616 --> 03:20.285
Thank you for cooking, it looks delicious.

03:20.451 --> 03:21.703
Oh, it's my pleasure.

03:22.787 --> 03:25.456
I'm so glad y'all could make it.
So, tell me what's going on back home.

03:26.416 --> 03:28.877
Well, Howard and Bernadette
had their baby.

03:29.544 --> 03:31.546
Oh, that's wonderful!

03:31.713 --> 03:35.341
Now, have they decided to raise it
Jewish or regular?

03:40.638 --> 03:42.056
Welcome to Texas.

03:44.434 --> 03:45.643
They haven't said.

03:46.603 --> 03:50.189
Anyway, we also have
some exciting news to share.

03:51.274 --> 03:53.151
Wait now.
Shouldn't we just eat?

03:53.401 --> 03:55.653
You know, I mean, God did take time
out of his busy schedule

03:55.820 --> 03:57.322
to bless these Sloppy Joes.

03:57.864 --> 03:59.824
Come on, Shelly. Tell me your news.

04:00.909 --> 04:02.660
- Right.
- This is on you.

04:04.329 --> 04:08.583
Amy and I are living together in sin,
like a couple of New Yorkers.

04:10.668 --> 04:14.005
Now, while you scold us,
I'm going to get a knife and a fork.

04:14.172 --> 04:15.840
Joe may be sloppy but Sheldon's not.

04:18.551 --> 04:23.348
Well, thank you for letting me know.
And I, for one, am thrilled.

04:25.808 --> 04:26.851
What?

04:28.353 --> 04:29.520
Where's the judgment?

04:29.854 --> 04:32.148
Where's the fire and brimstone?

04:32.315 --> 04:34.192
Where's the part where you tell us
we're going to hell,

04:34.400 --> 04:37.695
and I say, "Have you seen the size
of the bugs outside? We're already there!"

04:38.696 --> 04:41.491
Obviously I would prefer
if you weren't living out of wedlock,

04:41.658 --> 04:45.787
but given your special circumstances,
I'm very happy for you.

04:48.790 --> 04:51.918
And what special circumstances are those?

04:52.543 --> 04:55.505
Oh, boy. I think it's about to get bad.

04:57.715 --> 04:59.217
Shelly, how do I put this?

05:00.051 --> 05:04.806
By your third birthday, you had memorized
over a thousand different kinds of trains.

05:05.890 --> 05:10.561
And I never imagined a woman
getting aboard any of them.

05:15.566 --> 05:19.070
What? So... You thought I was
going to be alone for the rest of my life?

05:19.237 --> 05:21.447
No. Just for the middle part.

05:22.865 --> 05:25.076
'Cause at the end,
I assumed there'd be nurses.

05:27.078 --> 05:29.372
Well, this is highly insulting.

05:29.539 --> 05:31.040
Sheldon, don't overreact.

05:31.207 --> 05:32.959
I'm the child she was worried about?

05:33.126 --> 05:36.087
I have a brother and sister
whose combined intellectual wattage

05:36.254 --> 05:37.672
couldn't power a potato clock.

05:38.589 --> 05:39.966
If I spotted them the potato.

05:48.433 --> 05:49.434
What?

05:49.600 --> 05:51.853
I was in my room.
I couldn't hear what they were saying.

05:55.356 --> 05:56.607
I'll take over from here.

05:58.026 --> 05:59.902
He's been in there a long time.

06:01.112 --> 06:02.780
Should I go talk to him?

06:02.947 --> 06:05.408
He's upset with me.
I should be the one who talks to him.

06:09.996 --> 06:11.956
- Are you going to?
- Oh, heck, no.

06:27.638 --> 06:29.807
Sheldon, what are you doing?

06:31.350 --> 06:35.229
Just being the un-socialized eccentric
my mother always thought I was.

06:37.231 --> 06:39.484
You startin' to see
why I didn't go in there?

06:41.360 --> 06:42.862
Sheldon, if you're trying
to prove me wrong,

06:43.029 --> 06:46.032
the tighty-whities on your head
ain't changing my mind.

06:47.700 --> 06:49.118
We're ignoring the fins. Okay.

06:50.953 --> 06:52.830
And I don't understand
why you're taking her side.

06:53.081 --> 06:55.708
By being my girlfriend
she's saying, you're a weirdo, too.

06:56.542 --> 06:58.002
I don't think that's what she's saying.

06:58.211 --> 06:59.212
And...

06:59.754 --> 07:02.006
That's exactly what she was saying.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.760
Can you believe
my mother thinks we're both strange?

07:06.010 --> 07:07.637
Absolutely not.

07:07.845 --> 07:08.846
Yes. Too loud.

07:09.013 --> 07:10.431
Absolutely not.

07:12.683 --> 07:15.103
Well, after that Sheldon and I
got out of the house for a while.

07:15.269 --> 07:16.854
Well, first we buttered my feet

07:17.021 --> 07:18.648
to get the swim fins off,
and then we went out.

07:21.859 --> 07:24.153
I'm sorry your mother
made you feel bad, but...

07:24.320 --> 07:29.033
You know, at the end of the day
she was wrong, because you're not alone.

07:29.283 --> 07:30.368
You're right.

07:30.535 --> 07:33.704
I have Leonard and Howard and Raj,

07:33.871 --> 07:38.209
Stuart, Penny, Leonard's mom,
Bernadette, Wil Wheaton...

07:38.376 --> 07:40.128
What about the woman
who just buttered your big flat feet?

07:43.339 --> 07:44.966
I was going chronologically.

07:45.466 --> 07:49.720
You're right between Koothrappali's father
and Omar, the one-eyed Sparkletts guy.

07:50.930 --> 07:53.641
Well, let's try to not let it ruin
the rest of our trip.

07:53.808 --> 07:57.395
I knew we should've never mentioned
us living together in the first place.

07:57.770 --> 08:00.148
- She was going to find out eventually.
- Disagree.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.942
We've known about evolution since 1859.

08:03.109 --> 08:05.695
She still believes in Noah
and his amazing zoo boat.

08:07.613 --> 08:10.408
This could have all been avoided
if you had only listened to me.

08:12.243 --> 08:15.830
Sheldon, I knew your mother was fine
with us living together

08:15.997 --> 08:18.124
because I already told her we were.

08:20.084 --> 08:21.252
Why would you do that?

08:21.419 --> 08:23.254
This was a potential issue,

08:23.421 --> 08:27.508
so I got out ahead of it
and I managed the situation for you.

08:29.010 --> 08:31.095
You managed the situation?

08:31.345 --> 08:32.346
That's right.

08:32.638 --> 08:35.433
So, my mother thought
I was incapable of finding a mate,

08:35.600 --> 08:38.477
and my mate thinks
I'm incapable of running my own life.

08:39.270 --> 08:42.231
Not your whole life.
I mean, science, you got that.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.901
Organizing your sock drawer,
you're the king.

08:46.360 --> 08:49.197
But understanding
how other people are feeling,

08:49.363 --> 08:50.698
that's a weak spot for you.

08:50.990 --> 08:52.617
I have gotten much better at that.

08:53.284 --> 08:55.786
Have you? How am I feeling right now?

08:56.120 --> 08:57.288
How should I know?

09:00.041 --> 09:02.251
Excited, itchy? Give me the first letter.

09:04.045 --> 09:05.796
You and I are in a relationship.

09:06.172 --> 09:09.175
I help you with your shortcomings,
and you help me with mine.

09:10.134 --> 09:13.012
How would you feel if I contacted
your mother behind your back?

09:13.554 --> 09:16.515
Delighted that you showed
any interest in my family at all.

09:16.974 --> 09:18.184
Delighted?

09:18.643 --> 09:20.519
Not if I guessed for 100 years.

09:24.273 --> 09:25.316
- Hi.
- Hey, guys.

09:25.483 --> 09:27.568
- Hi.
- There's the little family.

09:27.735 --> 09:29.153
Hello.

09:31.322 --> 09:32.823
And their Sherpas.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.202
The baby's asleep.
Can we put her in your room?

09:36.369 --> 09:37.745
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Do you need help?

09:37.954 --> 09:38.996
No, I got it.

09:40.122 --> 09:41.832
Doubtfire, Poppins, follow me.

09:45.044 --> 09:47.088
- Sorry we're late.
- Oh, it's no problem.

09:47.255 --> 09:49.674
Amy and Sheldon were just telling us
about their trip to Texas.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.884
Yeah, here, I'll catch you up.

09:53.135 --> 09:55.012
- How did we get in the car?
- Stop.

09:57.640 --> 10:00.184
Okay, they told Mary they were
living together, there was a fight.

10:00.351 --> 10:02.478
He got his feelings hurt,
then he put underwear on his head...

10:02.645 --> 10:05.481
On purpose. Not the way it
used to happen in high school.

10:08.025 --> 10:10.319
I was acting odd intentionally.

10:10.736 --> 10:12.530
Really? So you can control it?

10:15.866 --> 10:17.034
Okay, then what happened?

10:17.285 --> 10:18.995
There's really not much left to tell.

10:19.161 --> 10:21.831
No, I decided that
my mother views me as a child

10:21.998 --> 10:25.876
because I never went through
a rebellious phase so, I got an earring...

10:30.214 --> 10:31.716
My mother made me take it out...

10:35.553 --> 10:36.971
Amy put alcohol on it...

10:41.392 --> 10:42.768
And here we are.

10:43.853 --> 10:47.023
- What did we miss?
- I couldn't explain it if I tried.

10:53.154 --> 10:56.240
So, tell me,
how did Sheldon look with an earring?

10:56.407 --> 10:59.869
Like the pirate who helps
the other pirates connect to the Internet.

11:02.538 --> 11:03.748
So, what did you and Leonard do?

11:04.081 --> 11:06.250
Actually, we got in a pretty nasty fight.

11:06.417 --> 11:07.918
It might've been
the worst one we ever had.

11:08.085 --> 11:09.170
Oh, my God. What happened?

11:09.337 --> 11:12.882
Well, we had started binge watching
<i>Luke Cage</i> together,

11:13.049 --> 11:14.467
and it was kind of our thing,

11:14.633 --> 11:18.262
and then, I find out that she watched
two episodes without me.

11:20.097 --> 11:23.142
It's like I was excited for a present
and got socks.

11:25.478 --> 11:28.189
I don't understand how that turns
into the worst fight of your life.

11:28.356 --> 11:29.940
I don't understand
what's wrong with socks.

11:31.275 --> 11:34.445
To be fair, we may have been on edge
because of the Christmas tree.

11:35.029 --> 11:36.364
What happened with the tree?

11:42.453 --> 11:44.121
You do make a cute elf.

11:44.288 --> 11:48.000
Yeah? And you thought Spock ears
were only good for Comic-Con.

11:49.377 --> 11:52.671
Hey, hey. I just found a farm where they
let you chop down your own tree.

11:53.047 --> 11:56.509
Oh, cool. I'll be like
a pointy-eared Paul Bunyan.

12:05.309 --> 12:06.769
Stupid idea.

12:08.521 --> 12:11.315
No. What's stupid is
a physicist who doesn't understand

12:11.482 --> 12:14.151
when you swing an ax, you don't let go.

12:16.445 --> 12:19.156
For the tenth time,
my mittens were slippery!

12:19.323 --> 12:23.119
Oh! It's 70 degrees.
You didn't need mittens.

12:23.285 --> 12:25.663
You know how easily I blister.

12:26.664 --> 12:28.582
Yes, yes. You bruise, you peel...

12:28.749 --> 12:30.418
It's like I'm married
to an old piece of fruit.

12:32.503 --> 12:35.131
Look, we could keep fighting
and let it ruin our night,

12:35.297 --> 12:37.716
or we can stop
and try to salvage the evening.

12:38.050 --> 12:39.468
- Fine.
- Thank you.

12:47.101 --> 12:49.061
- Leonard?
- Yeah.

12:49.687 --> 12:51.647
There's something on the windshield.

13:00.322 --> 13:01.824
You need a break?

13:02.116 --> 13:03.617
I do not need a break.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.287
There's no shame
in asking for a break.

13:06.454 --> 13:08.164
If I need a break,
I'll ask for a break!

13:10.291 --> 13:11.709
- Leonard?
- Yeah?

13:16.714 --> 13:18.048
There's a tree on you.

13:27.558 --> 13:29.018
You wanna decorate it tonight?

13:29.185 --> 13:31.562
Yeah. With gasoline and a match, sure.

13:46.410 --> 13:48.370
I hope it kills us both.

13:50.331 --> 13:51.499
By the way, if anyone asks,

13:51.665 --> 13:54.084
the elevator shaft
always had a tree in it.

13:56.378 --> 14:00.257
So, Bernadette,
if I express interest in your baby,

14:00.424 --> 14:02.176
will you promise not to make me touch it?

14:04.136 --> 14:06.597
- Sure.
- Hey, how's life with your baby?

14:08.599 --> 14:10.309
Really? You're never going to
touch their baby?

14:10.684 --> 14:12.770
To this day, I've never touched Stuart.

14:18.275 --> 14:20.861
It's been wonderful, Sheldon.
Thanks for asking.

14:22.988 --> 14:27.409
<i>Stop crying. I'm begging you.
I don't know what else to do.</i>

14:27.785 --> 14:30.329
<i>My boobs are empty. Do you want lasagna?</i>

14:34.458 --> 14:37.753
<i>It's okay. It's okay.</i>

14:45.511 --> 14:46.804
What have we done?

14:49.265 --> 14:52.851
Hey, I found superhero baby wipes.

14:53.018 --> 14:56.605
The perfect way to clean up crime,
and tushies.

15:00.526 --> 15:02.653
It took me two hours to get her down.

15:03.404 --> 15:05.739
You relax. I'll take this shift.

15:07.074 --> 15:09.994
You know, in India,
when my baby brother cried like that,

15:10.160 --> 15:12.830
the servants would just take him
far away so we couldn't hear it.

15:16.375 --> 15:18.294
Not always. Sometimes, we'd leave.

15:22.339 --> 15:24.008
Hey, he got her to stop.

15:25.342 --> 15:26.468
That was so fast.

15:26.635 --> 15:27.845
He's really good with her.

15:29.013 --> 15:30.806
Yeah, he has a gift.

15:33.350 --> 15:34.351
What's the matter?

15:34.685 --> 15:37.021
Nothing, these are happy tears.

15:38.230 --> 15:41.191
- Oh, good.
- No, they're not, you bozo!

15:43.819 --> 15:47.865
How come Stuart
can get her to stop crying, but I can't?

15:48.574 --> 15:49.992
It's Stuart.

15:50.701 --> 15:53.495
Maybe she's playing possum
until he goes away.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.166
Not funny.

15:57.666 --> 15:59.627
She's tired. That was funny.

16:02.087 --> 16:04.673
Everyone's a better mom than me.

16:04.882 --> 16:09.136
Oh, don't take it so personally.
Maybe your baby's just a jerk.

16:15.934 --> 16:17.353
So, how does the story end?

16:17.519 --> 16:20.272
Is the baby a jerk
or is Bernadette a bad mother?

16:22.900 --> 16:23.901
Sheldon!

16:24.068 --> 16:27.071
What? Is there another twist coming?
Is the baby not theirs at all?

16:29.406 --> 16:32.326
Ignore him.
How did you get the baby to stop crying?

16:32.743 --> 16:35.162
Oh, I just talked to her.

16:35.871 --> 16:39.708
I've been told the sound of my voice
puts people to sleep.

16:43.921 --> 16:46.382
You poor things, you must be exhausted.

16:47.091 --> 16:50.094
It has been hard to sleep
with all the crying.

16:56.558 --> 17:00.979
How can she hate me?
I make her food in my chest!

17:03.232 --> 17:06.485
It's like hating a frozen yogurt machine.

17:08.362 --> 17:10.948
She doesn't hate you. Stop saying that.

17:11.615 --> 17:13.492
Now you hate me, too!

17:15.035 --> 17:17.121
I don't hate you.

17:30.217 --> 17:35.514
It says here that "up to 80%
of new mothers experience baby blues,"

17:35.681 --> 17:37.975
and that "the best thing to do
is reassure them

17:38.142 --> 17:39.935
"that they're doing a good job."

17:40.102 --> 17:42.771
Bernadette, you are doing a good job.

17:46.442 --> 17:48.402
Thank you, Sheldon.
I'm feeling better now.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.279
Thank you, Internet.

17:50.612 --> 17:52.030
I'm telling you,
with the right YouTube video,

17:52.197 --> 17:53.532
I could give Howard a vasectomy.

17:57.494 --> 17:58.996
So, things started to turn around?

17:59.246 --> 18:02.249
Yeah, eventually I figured out
how to get the baby to sleep.

18:02.750 --> 18:05.502
Please tell me
you didn't use Amy's magic juice.

18:14.470 --> 18:16.680
- Bernie?
<i>- Shh. She's asleep.</i>

18:17.055 --> 18:18.223
Great.

18:19.892 --> 18:21.018
And where are you?

18:23.395 --> 18:24.813
<i>Down here.</i>

18:35.616 --> 18:36.617
Oh.

18:37.117 --> 18:38.702
This is new.

18:39.203 --> 18:41.663
I didn't know what else to do. It worked.

18:43.540 --> 18:47.753
I'd say that's thinking outside the box,
but... Come on.

18:50.547 --> 18:52.007
Don't make me laugh.

18:55.844 --> 18:57.387
Do you need help getting out?

18:57.721 --> 18:59.097
I think I live here now.

19:02.267 --> 19:03.727
It's fine.

19:03.894 --> 19:05.604
Is it okay if I get some sleep?

19:05.771 --> 19:07.314
Yeah, go ahead.

19:12.194 --> 19:13.612
Good job, Mommy.

19:14.863 --> 19:16.073
I'm proud of you.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.701
Don't make me cry, either.

19:20.828 --> 19:21.995
Good night.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.623
I love both my girls.

19:25.874 --> 19:26.917
We love you, too.

19:33.215 --> 19:34.800
I can't believe you fit in the crib.

19:35.551 --> 19:37.302
I could take a bath in the sink.

19:39.888 --> 19:41.098
I don't, but I can.

19:43.267 --> 19:45.310
- So, how were your holidays?
- Oh.

19:45.561 --> 19:46.645
Thank you for asking.

19:46.812 --> 19:49.606
I went to visit my grandmother.

19:49.773 --> 19:51.316
She's in Bakersfield.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.278
Usually my brother and sister go...

19:57.948 --> 19:58.991
Oh, come on!

20:05.747 --> 20:07.916
- That was fun. Thank you.
- Yeah, thanks.

20:08.125 --> 20:09.501
- Our pleasure.
- See you guys at work.

20:09.668 --> 20:12.421
- Be there bright and early.
- Not me, paternity leave.

20:13.213 --> 20:14.381
A small human wreaks havoc

20:14.548 --> 20:16.925
on his wife's genitals
and he gets time off.

20:18.594 --> 20:20.220
With pay, sucker!

20:25.225 --> 20:27.728
Forgot the baby. Still new to this.

20:58.258 --> 20:59.259
