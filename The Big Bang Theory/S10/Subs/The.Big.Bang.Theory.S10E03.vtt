WEBVTT

00:03.463 --> 00:04.589
It's pretty late.

00:04.756 --> 00:06.633
Think I've got time to
run some more simulations

00:06.800 --> 00:07.967
on the cooling system?

00:08.259 --> 00:10.804
Sure. I'm still figuring out
the thermo-acoustic expander.

00:10.970 --> 00:12.222
Yeah, while you do that

00:12.389 --> 00:16.351
I am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid
through my brain cells

00:16.559 --> 00:19.896
to remove the metabolic byproducts
of the day's thoughts.

00:20.730 --> 00:21.815
What?

00:22.023 --> 00:25.235
It's called sleep and it's my bedtime,
nighty-night, y'all.

00:25.819 --> 00:27.737
Hey, hey, hey, you're not going anywhere.

00:27.904 --> 00:29.906
And we only have two months
to deliver this to the Air Force

00:30.073 --> 00:31.116
because of you.

00:31.282 --> 00:32.909
I know, I was there.

00:34.035 --> 00:35.286
Well, wake up!

00:35.453 --> 00:37.122
We're gonna put in a lot of late nights.

00:37.288 --> 00:38.581
How late?

00:38.790 --> 00:41.543
Well, I don't know, midnight, 1:00.

00:41.835 --> 00:44.337
One o'clock? I'm not a raccoon.

00:46.297 --> 00:48.007
If you're tired, have some coffee.

00:48.174 --> 00:49.551
What? You have some coffee.

00:49.718 --> 00:50.927
I am having coffee!

00:51.636 --> 00:53.012
And look how irritable it's making you!

00:53.179 --> 00:54.389
Guys!

00:55.306 --> 00:57.100
We're not gonna get anything done
if we start fighting.

00:57.350 --> 00:59.310
Now, can you please
try to soldier through?

00:59.978 --> 01:01.771
Fine.

01:16.953 --> 01:18.538
I don't think I can go much longer.

01:18.705 --> 01:20.790
It's been three and a half minutes,
wake up.

01:48.651 --> 01:51.946
I had a bad dream
that my best friend became a tyrant

01:52.113 --> 01:54.199
and forced me to
stay up all night to work.

01:54.365 --> 01:56.409
I had a good dream that
when I carried you to bed

01:56.576 --> 01:59.370
I let your head hit the wall
and I laughed.

02:00.497 --> 02:02.081
- Good morning.
- What is this?

02:02.248 --> 02:04.918
Well, we didn't see you last night,
we're not gonna see you today,

02:05.084 --> 02:06.795
so we thought we could have
breakfast together.

02:06.961 --> 02:08.379
That is so nice.

02:08.546 --> 02:10.215
Ow! It does hurt!

02:12.509 --> 02:13.760
So, what are you guys gonna do today?

02:13.927 --> 02:16.429
Well, Sheldon was supposed to
go to this party with me this afternoon,

02:16.596 --> 02:17.680
but I don't think that's happening.

02:17.847 --> 02:19.432
Oh, that was never happening.

02:20.433 --> 02:22.310
I'll go, I like a party.

02:22.644 --> 02:25.063
Well, I mean, to be honest,
it's not like a "party" party,

02:25.230 --> 02:26.397
it's more like a gathering

02:26.564 --> 02:28.942
where scientists of different
disciplines get together

02:29.108 --> 02:31.569
to share their work and keep current
on what's going on in other fields,

02:31.736 --> 02:33.655
I don't know
why I called it a party, sorry.

02:34.280 --> 02:35.615
It's okay, I'll still go.

02:35.782 --> 02:36.908
You don't think you'll be bored?

02:37.075 --> 02:38.326
I'll have some wine

02:38.493 --> 02:40.703
and listen to people go on
about crap I don't understand.

02:40.870 --> 02:43.790
I mean, how is it any different
than every single day of my life?

02:44.707 --> 02:46.084
I won't be there.

02:46.417 --> 02:47.961
Look at that, it is a party.

02:48.127 --> 02:49.379
<i>Yeah.</i>

02:51.422 --> 02:52.966
Sorry I have to work all weekend.

02:53.132 --> 02:54.217
It's okay.

02:54.384 --> 02:55.802
Thanks again for breakfast.

02:55.969 --> 02:57.637
Well, I didn't get to see you last night.

02:58.888 --> 03:00.098
The least I could do.

03:00.265 --> 03:02.725
You shouldn't have
made the alarm code his birthday.

03:05.645 --> 03:08.356
So, what should we do today?

03:08.523 --> 03:10.900
I appreciate it, but you don't have to
spend your day off with me.

03:11.067 --> 03:12.443
Well, I don't mind.

03:12.694 --> 03:14.612
Oh, you wanna go to the mall
and look at baby stuff?

03:14.863 --> 03:15.864
Not really.

03:16.072 --> 03:17.699
Oh, come on, we could share a pretzel

03:17.866 --> 03:21.369
and get sideways glances
from racist old ladies.

03:22.287 --> 03:24.247
I get enough of that when I take Howard

03:24.414 --> 03:25.874
to my grandmother's for Christmas.

03:27.208 --> 03:28.293
Oh, I know.

03:28.459 --> 03:30.962
Why don't we get started on
clearing out the baby's room?

03:31.129 --> 03:32.463
Isn't it a little early for that?

03:32.839 --> 03:34.173
You have to get to it eventually.

03:34.340 --> 03:36.843
There's so much junk in there,
it's embarrassing.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.970
How can you be embarrassed around me?

03:39.137 --> 03:41.180
I'm gonna be in the room with you
when you give birth.

03:48.563 --> 03:49.981
I don't think you are.

03:51.024 --> 03:53.234
You didn't think I was gonna be
in your kitchen this morning,

03:53.401 --> 03:54.694
yet here I am.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.661
<i>Psst! Hey, kid.</i>

04:03.912 --> 04:05.246
What?

04:08.124 --> 04:10.877
You look tired.
Why don't you have an energy drink?

04:11.127 --> 04:12.337
Everyone's doing it.

04:14.505 --> 04:17.258
Oh, no, thank you,
those have caffeine in them.

04:17.634 --> 04:19.844
Oh, sorry, I thought you were cool.

04:22.347 --> 04:23.514
I am cool.

04:23.681 --> 04:25.058
This is Yoo-hoo,

04:25.224 --> 04:27.810
chocolate milk's delicious, watery cousin.

04:28.519 --> 04:31.981
All right, but if you ever wanna
feel like you have superpowers,

04:32.398 --> 04:33.858
try one of these.

04:34.609 --> 04:37.403
Superheroes take
performance-enhancing chemicals?

04:37.570 --> 04:38.571
<i>You bet.</i>

04:38.738 --> 04:40.490
You know why Hulk is so strong?

04:41.240 --> 04:42.533
Steroids.

04:44.577 --> 04:48.164
You know why Batman wanders around
at night getting into fights?

04:49.040 --> 04:50.124
Scotch.

04:53.002 --> 04:55.546
I am facing a great deal of work.

04:55.797 --> 05:00.051
And I do like things better when
famous people also like them.

05:01.052 --> 05:03.262
Here. It's on the house.

05:05.014 --> 05:06.557
The first one's free?

05:07.517 --> 05:09.852
Flash, how do you stay in business?

05:10.186 --> 05:11.688
You wanna know my secret?

05:12.397 --> 05:14.565
I bought stock in Marvel.

05:18.069 --> 05:19.904
Hi, Bert. This is my friend Penny.

05:20.071 --> 05:21.572
- Hi.
- Hey. Come on in.

05:21.739 --> 05:23.574
I'm gonna go turn on some rock music.

05:23.741 --> 05:25.576
That's a geology joke.

05:26.744 --> 05:27.870
Bert's a geologist.

05:28.037 --> 05:29.414
And a joker.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.876
How early are we?

05:34.043 --> 05:35.753
Oh, actually, we're an hour late.

05:37.171 --> 05:39.549
I suddenly wish Sheldon was here.

05:44.679 --> 05:46.431
I don't even know where to begin.

05:46.889 --> 05:49.517
Well, in <i>The Sound of Music,</i>
Julie Andrews says,

05:49.684 --> 05:53.229
"Let's start at the very beginning.
A very good place to start."

05:54.480 --> 05:57.316
Huh. I was gonna start at the end,
thank God you're here.

05:59.777 --> 06:02.947
Well, I think the first thing
we should get rid of is that tone.

06:04.157 --> 06:05.324
Sorry.

06:06.451 --> 06:08.661
I should probably keep this
in case we have a girl.

06:08.828 --> 06:11.456
Ah, that's a nice one.
Was it yours when you were little?

06:11.622 --> 06:12.915
My dad built it for me.

06:13.082 --> 06:14.459
Wow, that's so cute.

06:15.168 --> 06:17.295
This was the husband, this was the wife.

06:17.503 --> 06:18.921
They'd go out on adventures together.

06:19.589 --> 06:21.591
Cruises, skiing, horseback riding.

06:21.883 --> 06:24.510
That was really me just
duct taping them to our dog.

06:25.636 --> 06:27.764
- And did they have kids?
- They did.

06:27.972 --> 06:29.932
But the mommy and daddy didn't like them

06:30.099 --> 06:33.144
so they shipped them off to an orphanage
I made out of a shoebox.

06:34.312 --> 06:36.773
Yeah, that's not worrisome at all.

06:38.149 --> 06:40.568
Not every girl dreams about being a mom.

06:41.277 --> 06:43.279
Sometimes you think
you're never gonna have kids

06:43.446 --> 06:45.073
and one day you wake up
and you're pregnant.

06:45.239 --> 06:47.408
And it doesn't matter that your
career's going great right now

06:47.575 --> 06:49.327
and that you and your husband
never even got to go anywhere

06:49.494 --> 06:50.661
taped to a dog!

06:53.539 --> 06:55.083
I skipped spin class for this.

06:59.378 --> 07:03.841
Why is it taking him so long
to get a drink out of a vending machine?

07:04.092 --> 07:05.134
Well, it's complicated.

07:05.301 --> 07:07.887
He finds pushing that little door
and reaching up into the machine

07:08.054 --> 07:09.639
uncomfortably intimate.

07:11.641 --> 07:13.518
Gentlemen, I am ready to work.

07:13.684 --> 07:16.562
To quote <i>The Martian,</i>
"Let's science the feces out of this!"

07:17.021 --> 07:19.273
And that... That's <i>The Martian</i> the book
and <i>The Martian</i> the movie,

07:19.440 --> 07:21.400
not Marvin the Martian.
Although, to quote Marvin the Martian,

07:21.567 --> 07:24.946
"I claim this planet in the name of Mars."

07:25.738 --> 07:26.864
Are you okay?

07:27.031 --> 07:28.449
Oh, I'm fantastic, never been better.

07:28.699 --> 07:30.576
I had my first energy drink
and I feel great.

07:30.743 --> 07:32.078
Hey, you guys wanna wrestle?

07:32.245 --> 07:34.080
We can do arm, thumb, mud, sumo.

07:34.247 --> 07:36.207
Nah, we're not fat enough
or wearing diapers.

07:39.544 --> 07:40.711
You wanted him awake.

07:50.054 --> 07:53.266
So should we talk to each other or mingle?

07:54.892 --> 07:56.894
I don't know where everyone is.

07:57.061 --> 07:58.229
Yeah, I mean,

07:58.396 --> 08:01.607
I could see him eating one or two guests
but not a whole party.

08:02.817 --> 08:05.027
Well, I guess this is kind of a bust.

08:05.444 --> 08:06.904
You don't have to stay.

08:07.071 --> 08:08.406
I'm gonna start cleaning up.

08:08.573 --> 08:09.824
Okay.

08:10.575 --> 08:12.076
I feel so bad about leaving him here.

08:12.243 --> 08:15.580
Well, that's funny, I was just
thinking the same thing about you.

08:16.581 --> 08:17.665
Hey, listen,

08:17.832 --> 08:21.169
could you not say anything about this
to the people at the university?

08:21.794 --> 08:26.048
You know, 'cause you're you and I'm me,
and it's kind of embarrassing.

08:26.299 --> 08:28.259
Wait, what do you mean she's her?

08:28.426 --> 08:31.262
Well, you know how Amy's
the coolest girl on campus, right?

08:31.429 --> 08:33.014
- No!
- No.

08:33.681 --> 08:35.057
Oh, yeah, everybody thinks so.

08:35.516 --> 08:36.517
What?

08:36.684 --> 08:39.562
You tell me about your foot fungus
but this is a secret?

08:41.522 --> 08:43.649
I'm sure it's just 'cause
I'm dating Sheldon.

08:44.066 --> 08:47.278
Actually, I think Sheldon's popular
because he's dating you.

08:49.614 --> 08:52.575
Now Sheldon's popular? What is happening?

08:56.913 --> 08:59.457
Maybe we should break for lunch.
What time is it?

09:03.294 --> 09:06.339
According to the world's
worst cuckoo clock, it's 2:00.

09:07.465 --> 09:10.718
My head hurts
and I'm more tired than ever.

09:11.010 --> 09:12.136
Why don't you just go home?

09:12.303 --> 09:14.096
No, I can do this.

09:14.263 --> 09:16.849
I just... I just need
another energy drink.

09:17.433 --> 09:18.726
Oh, no.

09:19.518 --> 09:20.561
What?

09:20.770 --> 09:22.146
I want another one.

09:22.313 --> 09:23.314
So?

09:23.481 --> 09:24.774
That's a craving.

09:24.941 --> 09:26.984
That's a sign of chemical dependency.

09:28.069 --> 09:29.612
You only had one.

09:29.779 --> 09:33.407
I know, but plenty of things are addictive
after a single exposure.

09:33.574 --> 09:36.577
Crack cocaine, nicotine, Pringles.

09:37.245 --> 09:40.164
You know once one pops
one just can't stop.

09:40.831 --> 09:42.750
You can't develop a problem that fast.

09:42.917 --> 09:45.586
You wanna bet?
Oh, great, now I'm addicted to gambling.

09:50.174 --> 09:52.885
We can't afford to lose any more time.

09:53.177 --> 09:54.720
Well, this probably won't work

09:54.887 --> 09:57.682
but has anyone ever tried to just haul off

09:57.974 --> 09:59.642
and whoop the crazy out of him?

10:00.810 --> 10:02.144
That's not helpful.

10:02.436 --> 10:04.772
It's fun to think about
but it's not helpful.

10:06.023 --> 10:07.149
Hey,

10:07.525 --> 10:09.986
Sheldon, we are on a serious time crunch.

10:10.152 --> 10:12.822
We can't do this without you.
Can you please pull it together?

10:12.989 --> 10:14.782
I'm sorry, yes, of course.

10:15.032 --> 10:16.200
Thank you.

10:16.701 --> 10:18.536
Just please bear with me

10:18.703 --> 10:21.372
if I display symptoms
of caffeine withdrawal.

10:22.540 --> 10:23.916
No worries.

10:44.770 --> 10:46.022
You guys stink.

10:48.941 --> 10:51.652
Sorry I flipped out on you.
I think it's just hormones.

10:51.819 --> 10:54.363
I think you were mean
before you were pregnant, but it's fine.

10:56.240 --> 10:59.076
So, uh, instead of cleaning out the room,

10:59.410 --> 11:01.620
why don't we just decide on a theme
for the nursery?

11:01.787 --> 11:03.164
Does it really need one?

11:03.372 --> 11:06.375
Of course it does, didn't your
baby room have a theme?

11:06.834 --> 11:09.253
Well, it doubled as my dad's office
and he was a cop.

11:09.420 --> 11:12.631
So, I guess the theme was
bloody homicide photos.

11:13.591 --> 11:15.968
Oh. Mine was <i>Winnie the Pooh.</i>

11:17.511 --> 11:19.180
But, anyway,

11:19.805 --> 11:23.267
why don't we just take a step back
and start with the color?

11:23.434 --> 11:24.894
Right? There's so many amazing ones.

11:25.061 --> 11:27.855
Red, blue, green, purple...

11:28.022 --> 11:29.440
Are you just gonna name all the colors?

11:30.399 --> 11:31.484
Well, not now.

11:33.944 --> 11:35.905
I don't care what color the room is.

11:36.280 --> 11:37.573
Okay, well, I'm just trying to help you.

11:37.740 --> 11:39.617
Well, you're not. So just drop it.

11:43.704 --> 11:46.374
<i>I'm clearly upset,
why aren't you following me?</i>

11:47.124 --> 11:48.793
Sorry, sorry!

11:50.669 --> 11:54.298
And when Amy started using a solution
of chromic acid and white vinegar

11:54.465 --> 11:56.133
to clean all her lab equipment,

11:56.300 --> 11:58.886
all of a sudden, everybody was doin' it.

12:01.055 --> 12:02.765
You trendsetter!

12:02.932 --> 12:05.476
It was just the right idea
at the right time.

12:06.185 --> 12:09.563
Okay, okay, so Amy's cool, Sheldon's cool.
Tell me about Leonard.

12:09.980 --> 12:11.023
Who?

12:12.733 --> 12:14.318
Leonard Hofstadter.

12:14.652 --> 12:17.071
Oh, him. I guess he's all right.

12:17.655 --> 12:19.824
Apparently he tricked some hot girl
into marrying him.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.285
That's me! I'm her!

12:23.994 --> 12:27.373
And you know, he didn't trick me.
He just wore me down.

12:28.207 --> 12:29.959
Makes sense you two are friends.

12:30.251 --> 12:32.169
I mean, hot girls always stick together.

12:34.713 --> 12:38.384
And you thought this wasn't
gonna be a great party.

12:39.385 --> 12:43.055
You know, I had no idea,
Caltech is exactly like my high school.

12:43.305 --> 12:45.015
Well, it's not exactly like it.

12:45.182 --> 12:47.184
You know, we're all extremely smart.

12:49.103 --> 12:51.188
Wow, you popular girls are mean.

12:54.650 --> 12:57.027
I'm gonna get some coffee.
You want some?

12:57.194 --> 13:00.030
Uh, you're really going to have caffeine
in front of me

13:00.197 --> 13:01.949
while I'm trying to get my life
back on track?

13:03.200 --> 13:04.326
Okay.

13:04.535 --> 13:06.412
Let's pretend you do have a problem.

13:06.579 --> 13:07.663
- I do.
- You don't.

13:07.830 --> 13:10.040
- Yeah, but I do.
- No, you don't!

13:10.499 --> 13:12.877
But let's say you do
and don't say you do because you don't!

13:15.379 --> 13:18.132
Well, wouldn't you think that
throwing yourself into your work

13:18.299 --> 13:19.884
would be the best way to deal with it?

13:20.468 --> 13:22.178
- With what?
- Your problem.

13:22.636 --> 13:23.929
I thought I didn't have a problem.

13:29.268 --> 13:30.895
That was painful to watch.

13:35.441 --> 13:37.610
- So, where are we going?
- I don't know.

13:38.235 --> 13:39.320
Okay.

13:39.487 --> 13:41.572
How <i>Thelma and Louise</i> of us.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.784
Raj, why don't I care about anything?

13:46.076 --> 13:47.119
I'm sorry?

13:47.786 --> 13:51.999
It's my baby, I should care about
nurseries and colors and I don't.

13:52.208 --> 13:53.501
What's wrong with me?

13:54.251 --> 13:57.671
Well, crime scene photos
near your crib spring to mind.

13:58.589 --> 14:01.717
I keep waiting to feel excited
but it's not happening.

14:02.468 --> 14:04.553
What if it never happens?

14:05.054 --> 14:06.096
Bernadette,

14:06.305 --> 14:09.266
come on, look,
you're over-thinking this, okay?

14:09.600 --> 14:11.477
You're gonna be an amazing mom.

14:11.644 --> 14:15.189
Even if you don't believe it,
I know you have maternal instincts.

14:15.606 --> 14:17.858
Once I was supposed to
babysit my brothers,

14:18.025 --> 14:20.945
our neighbor found them naked in
the backyard eating crickets.

14:23.113 --> 14:26.367
Happy and well-fed. You see, that's
what I'm taking from that story.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.624
Leonard, can I ask you a question?

14:33.791 --> 14:36.293
Is it about the rotational symmetries
you should be figuring out

14:36.460 --> 14:37.753
or your fake caffeine problem?

14:40.589 --> 14:42.132
Howard, can I ask you a question?

14:43.384 --> 14:44.510
No.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.638
All right, I'll just toss this
out to the room.

14:47.805 --> 14:51.141
Um, I was thinking that the best way
to fight my addiction

14:51.308 --> 14:53.143
is by weaning myself off in steps.

14:53.394 --> 14:55.354
Now, I couldn't find a caffeine patch

14:55.688 --> 15:01.068
but I did find what claims to be
a mind-boosting caffeine suppository.

15:02.653 --> 15:05.114
Yeah. You know, there's an
interesting fact about the rectum...

15:05.364 --> 15:06.574
Sheldon!

15:08.325 --> 15:10.578
We are dealing with an impossible deadline

15:10.744 --> 15:12.162
from the Air Force because of you.

15:12.705 --> 15:14.832
So, have an energy drink,
don't have an energy drink.

15:14.999 --> 15:18.627
Order suppositories and shove them
wherever you want, I don't care!

15:20.838 --> 15:24.383
You don't shove them, they come
with an easy-glide applicator.

15:26.594 --> 15:27.595
Right.

15:28.012 --> 15:30.973
Listen to me, we can't do anything
until you do your part.

15:31.140 --> 15:33.642
So, get up in front of this whiteboard
and do it!

15:34.101 --> 15:35.853
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

15:36.020 --> 15:37.104
No...

15:37.646 --> 15:39.648
I can't figure out the math.

15:40.024 --> 15:43.235
I've been racking my brain for days
and I've got nothing.

15:45.321 --> 15:46.405
Seriously?

15:46.572 --> 15:47.781
No, I can't do it.

15:47.948 --> 15:49.867
I'm not as smart as I think I am.

15:50.326 --> 15:52.953
I'm so sorry, this is all my fault.

15:57.207 --> 15:59.460
It's okay. We'll figure something out.

15:59.627 --> 16:01.253
But what if we can't?

16:02.046 --> 16:03.380
It'll be fine.

16:04.548 --> 16:05.841
You'll see.

16:10.721 --> 16:12.056
Sheldon?

16:14.683 --> 16:16.060
Buddy?

16:22.900 --> 16:25.819
When the baby gets here
you gotta teach me that.

16:30.074 --> 16:32.034
Thank you so much, Bert, this was great.

16:32.201 --> 16:33.452
My pleasure.

16:33.619 --> 16:37.373
You girls wanna take home
a two-gallon tub of potato salad?

16:38.916 --> 16:40.084
- I think we're good.
- Mmm.

16:40.501 --> 16:42.711
Okay, well, thanks for coming by.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.046
You're nice people.

16:44.755 --> 16:46.048
Well, so are you.

16:46.298 --> 16:49.551
In fact, you know what?
We will never take you for "granite."

16:50.260 --> 16:51.762
Did you get that?

16:52.262 --> 16:55.224
Granite? It's a little geology joke.

16:56.934 --> 16:58.769
You need to leave,
I'm in love with both of you now.

16:58.977 --> 17:00.104
- Okay.
- Bye.

17:03.941 --> 17:05.442
Uh, pull over.

17:05.776 --> 17:07.361
Why, who are you calling?

17:08.112 --> 17:09.738
You're gonna rat me out to Howard,
aren't you?

17:09.905 --> 17:12.658
You're such a snitch.
No wonder I don't like you.

17:14.118 --> 17:17.037
Whoa! I'm calling my dad. Okay?

17:17.204 --> 17:19.415
He's got experience dealing
with pregnant ladies

17:19.581 --> 17:20.874
because he's an OB-GYN,

17:21.250 --> 17:23.794
and experience with crazy ladies
because of my mom.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.589
<i>Hello, Rajesh.</i>

17:27.965 --> 17:30.134
<i>- Are you calling to ask for money?</i>
- No.

17:30.300 --> 17:32.302
<i>Are you calling to ask for things
that cost money?</i>

17:32.511 --> 17:34.638
- No.
<i>- Great, what's up?</i>

17:35.472 --> 17:37.516
Okay, this is my friend Bernadette.

17:37.683 --> 17:40.018
She's pregnant and she's a bit worried.

17:40.185 --> 17:41.562
So, I thought maybe you could talk to her.

17:41.729 --> 17:44.064
O <i>f course. What seems to be the trouble?</i>

17:44.481 --> 17:45.482
Something's wrong.

17:45.816 --> 17:49.611
I don't care about any of the baby stuff
every other mom is so into.

17:50.195 --> 17:52.865
Honestly, I'm not even sure I like babies.

17:53.532 --> 17:57.327
<i>Look, some people are baby people
and some people are not baby people.</i>

17:57.911 --> 17:59.830
<i>It doesn't mean you won't
love your own baby.</i>

18:00.581 --> 18:02.708
But I thought I'd be more excited.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.128
<i>Being excited isn't
a guarantee of anything.</i>

18:06.378 --> 18:09.298
<i>Rajesh's mother was thrilled
when she was pregnant with him.</i>

18:09.590 --> 18:12.634
<i>After he was born,
she doted on his every move.</i>

18:12.801 --> 18:14.261
<i>And you know what happened?</i>

18:14.470 --> 18:16.388
<i>He broke her heart,
moved halfway around the world</i>

18:16.555 --> 18:18.140
<i>and dates only poor white women.</i>

18:21.185 --> 18:23.020
<i>So, you never know.</i>

18:24.188 --> 18:25.856
Thank you, I feel better now.

18:26.023 --> 18:27.441
I don't!

18:27.608 --> 18:30.694
<i>Good. Bernadette,
I hope you have a daughter.</i>

18:36.867 --> 18:39.536
Uh, I don't really know how to say this...

18:39.703 --> 18:41.705
Well, you could try starting with "sir."

18:42.206 --> 18:43.749
Right, sorry, sir.

18:43.916 --> 18:46.168
He said start with it, not end with it.

18:48.295 --> 18:49.296
Sir,

18:49.713 --> 18:51.507
we've hit a bit of a snag.

18:51.673 --> 18:53.383
We're already behind schedule.

18:54.301 --> 18:57.888
The computations required to
overcome the deployability issues

18:58.055 --> 19:00.224
are more significant than we thought.

19:00.390 --> 19:02.559
I understand that we're under contract

19:02.726 --> 19:05.395
and I don't know what the
consequences of violating that are.

19:05.562 --> 19:09.942
But, um, we're not gonna be able to
deliver in the time we promised.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.450
How long do you need?

19:19.493 --> 19:23.497
We're thinking two years.

19:26.291 --> 19:27.543
All right.

19:29.670 --> 19:32.214
That's it? You're okay with that?

19:32.589 --> 19:34.716
What, you think you're
the first government contractor

19:34.883 --> 19:36.593
who isn't gonna deliver on time?

19:36.927 --> 19:39.137
We're still waiting for
a big space laser Reagan ordered

19:39.304 --> 19:40.681
to beat the commies.

19:43.225 --> 19:44.393
Thanks for understanding, sir.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.061
Yes, thank you so much.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.355
We, we really appreciate it.

19:49.565 --> 19:50.983
<i>All right, pressure's off.</i>

19:51.149 --> 19:53.068
<i>- Wanna see a movie?
- Popcorn's on me.</i>

20:22.806 --> 20:23.807
English - SDH
