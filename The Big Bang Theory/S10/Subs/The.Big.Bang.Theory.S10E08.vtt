WEBVTT

00:04.673 --> 00:06.299
How much will it hurt?

00:07.258 --> 00:10.345
It's just a tiny skin sample.
You saw me do it to myself.

00:10.887 --> 00:14.224
On a scale of one to 10,
where "one" is a pebble in your shoe

00:14.432 --> 00:18.853
and "10" is the monkey you thought
was your pet biting your face off.

00:19.854 --> 00:22.232
- A two.
- Eating a whole Altoid?

00:24.776 --> 00:27.362
Sheldon, if I'm gonna synthesize
a neural network from our skin cells,

00:27.529 --> 00:28.571
I need to harvest them.

00:28.738 --> 00:31.241
Now, I've done this dozens of times,

00:31.408 --> 00:32.659
but if you're too scared
you don't have to.

00:32.826 --> 00:36.371
No, this is for science.
I can be brave for science.

00:38.581 --> 00:39.916
Thank you.

00:40.208 --> 00:41.876
Oh, Jiminy! That's cold!

00:42.460 --> 00:44.295
Just think how happy you'll be
in a few weeks

00:44.462 --> 00:47.215
when I've converted our skin cells
into functional brain cells.

00:48.133 --> 00:50.844
All right, just warn me before you do it.

00:51.302 --> 00:52.429
Okay.

00:53.638 --> 00:56.474
Three, two, and we're done.

00:59.644 --> 01:01.020
You tricked me!

01:01.187 --> 01:02.647
Well, you didn't say "one".

01:02.814 --> 01:04.023
Well, it didn't hurt, did it?

01:04.190 --> 01:06.901
No, but "three, two, and we're done"
is incomplete.

01:07.068 --> 01:08.862
You know those things bother me.

01:09.028 --> 01:11.322
It's like hearing "da-da-da-da duh-dah"
without yelling...

01:11.489 --> 01:14.534
- Okay, fine. One.
- Thank you.

01:15.201 --> 01:17.871
Now yell "charge,"
and we can get out of here.

01:46.733 --> 01:48.943
Oh, my God! I just got it.

01:49.986 --> 01:52.739
"Fun onions." Funyuns!

01:57.118 --> 01:59.537
Hold on. Is that a wobble?

02:00.705 --> 02:03.708
Yes. That's definitely
a gravitational wobble.

02:03.958 --> 02:06.044
Uh, sorry, I could come back.

02:06.211 --> 02:08.213
Oh, no. It's okay, I just found a wobble.

02:08.713 --> 02:10.465
Oh, do I need a mop?

02:11.883 --> 02:13.718
It's a gravitational wobble.

02:13.885 --> 02:16.638
It could be a sign of an
extra-solar planet that may contain life

02:16.805 --> 02:18.014
and someday be named after me.

02:18.306 --> 02:22.268
Oh. Well, if it has life,
maybe it already has a name, huh?

02:22.435 --> 02:24.020
Yeah, but it's probably difficult
to pronounce.

02:24.646 --> 02:27.398
- What is your name?
- Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.

02:29.234 --> 02:31.236
You think it would be more difficult
than that?

02:32.779 --> 02:34.906
Good point. And you are?

02:35.114 --> 02:37.534
Oh, uh, Issabella Maria Concepcion.

02:37.742 --> 02:40.245
- Oh. Well, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

02:41.079 --> 02:43.498
You know, I have to say,
based on the candy wrappers

02:43.665 --> 02:45.583
and the bags of junk food
I see in this trash,

02:45.750 --> 02:48.086
I thought the person working here
was 10 years old.

02:48.253 --> 02:50.672
Oh, please,
show me a 10-year-old

02:50.839 --> 02:53.258
who knows to dip Tootsie Rolls in Nutella.

02:54.592 --> 02:56.678
<i>Bueno</i>. Um, I'm just going to empty
your wastepaper basket

02:56.845 --> 02:57.887
and then I'll get out of your way.

02:58.054 --> 02:59.430
Oh, please, allow me.

03:02.517 --> 03:04.561
That's a lot of empty calories.

03:06.062 --> 03:07.772
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

03:11.526 --> 03:13.611
Okay, uh, okay.

03:13.820 --> 03:18.408
I have to go. Good luck with your,
um, space exploration.

03:18.575 --> 03:22.912
Thank you.
Good luck with your future endeavors.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.794
Did it work? Are they brain cells yet?

03:29.961 --> 03:31.629
If you'd give me a minute, I'll tell you.

03:31.796 --> 03:33.047
Oh, just let me look.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.967
Oh, my goodness.

03:36.134 --> 03:40.179
I see quivering black lines,
those must be neurons.

03:40.346 --> 03:42.307
Oh, they're so thick and beautiful.

03:42.473 --> 03:44.142
Those are your eyelashes. Move!

03:48.521 --> 03:51.941
Well, Sheldon, I see astrocytes.

03:52.942 --> 03:55.737
Our combined skin cells are now
a primitive neural network.

03:58.364 --> 04:02.660
I have such a profound sense of creation.

04:02.827 --> 04:04.829
It's like when I hatched sea monkeys,

04:05.663 --> 04:09.626
except that this is from my DNA,
so this is like me-monkeys.

04:12.003 --> 04:13.504
These cells come from both of us.

04:13.671 --> 04:15.798
Yeah, but "us-monkeys" doesn't pop.

04:16.174 --> 04:19.177
Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait!
"We-monkeys," there you go.

04:19.928 --> 04:21.930
Hey, when can we start
running tests on it?

04:22.513 --> 04:23.973
No reason we can't start right now.

04:24.140 --> 04:26.225
What stimulus
should we introduce it to first?

04:26.392 --> 04:28.227
Light, sound, temperature?

04:28.394 --> 04:31.189
Oh, oh! Let's expose it
to images of me and you,

04:31.356 --> 04:33.024
and see who it likes better.

04:33.816 --> 04:36.152
Sheldon, this is a rudimentary collection
of neurons.

04:36.319 --> 04:38.571
It's remarkable,
but it's still limited in what it can do.

04:38.738 --> 04:39.948
I understand.

04:40.865 --> 04:42.158
She's the mean one, I'm the fun one.

04:46.120 --> 04:49.207
Huh. They screwed up and gave us
steamed broccoli.

04:49.374 --> 04:50.917
- Oh, no, that's mine.
- Really?

04:51.084 --> 04:54.003
Last green thing I saw you eat
was a skittle.

04:55.338 --> 04:57.090
Well, I can't eat like a 10-year-old
all the time.

04:57.256 --> 04:59.217
You're dating somebody. Who is it?

05:00.051 --> 05:01.469
What? What are you talking about?

05:01.636 --> 05:03.304
You only watch what you eat
when you're afraid

05:03.471 --> 05:04.847
you might have to take your shirt off.

05:06.683 --> 05:08.851
Well, she's right.
As long as I've known you

05:09.060 --> 05:11.562
you've always been self-conscious
about your cleavage.

05:12.814 --> 05:15.233
That's because you keep trying to stick
pencils in it.

05:17.568 --> 05:19.320
All right, fine, don't tell us.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.239
There's nothing to tell.

05:21.406 --> 05:22.532
All right.

05:27.578 --> 05:28.579
How's that broccoli?

05:28.746 --> 05:30.707
It's gross, but I have to eat it.
Because I met somebody.

05:30.873 --> 05:33.376
Bam! Thank you! What's her name?

05:33.543 --> 05:34.877
- Issabella.
- Oh.

05:35.253 --> 05:36.295
Did you meet her at work?

05:37.588 --> 05:39.132
Yes, in the telescope room.

05:39.882 --> 05:40.925
So, she's an astronomer.

05:42.218 --> 05:46.264
Yes. Which is why
she was in the telescope room.

05:46.431 --> 05:48.474
Yes, this is all making sense, good.

05:48.641 --> 05:50.768
Well, that's great, Raj.
You must have so much in common.

05:50.935 --> 05:51.936
Mmm-hmm.

05:52.186 --> 05:53.646
So, when do we meet her?

05:53.813 --> 05:57.483
No, no, this is brand new.
We haven't even been on a proper date yet.

05:57.650 --> 05:59.944
- Okay, well, good luck with it.
- Thank you.

06:01.696 --> 06:03.281
How come you never eat broccoli?

06:04.991 --> 06:07.243
I'm married,
I don't have to be attractive.

06:11.914 --> 06:12.957
You know, most people don't realize

06:13.124 --> 06:15.877
this technique has actually been around
for a few years.

06:16.044 --> 06:18.337
Still, I can't believe
you can turn ordinary skin cells

06:18.504 --> 06:19.797
into functioning brain cells.

06:20.214 --> 06:21.758
Well, I turned this one
into a functioning boyfriend,

06:21.924 --> 06:22.967
so sky's the limit.

06:25.470 --> 06:29.640
Look, look, here I am
standing next to the incubator.

06:31.059 --> 06:34.604
And here is a microscopic view
of the cells.

06:35.980 --> 06:38.858
Look at that. Put 'em in
a tiny Flash T-shirt, and it's you.

06:40.526 --> 06:44.864
This little guy can already recognize
electronically transmitted images

06:45.031 --> 06:47.825
20% faster than any other sample
in Amy's lab.

06:49.202 --> 06:50.745
I'm running out of ways to act excited.

06:53.664 --> 06:56.167
So, enough about us.
How are things going with you?

06:56.334 --> 06:59.128
Great. The doctor said
the baby's head is facing down now.

06:59.670 --> 07:03.299
Good, you know, in case
the exit isn't clearly marked, it's...

07:04.092 --> 07:07.845
You know, I have to say,
it is nice to share this experience

07:08.054 --> 07:10.515
with someone who's on the same journey,
you know?

07:11.349 --> 07:14.685
Although, right now,
ours is testing off the charts

07:14.852 --> 07:17.522
while yours is floating around
in its own waste.

07:19.774 --> 07:23.820
Are you actually comparing my human baby
to your brain in a bowl?

07:26.114 --> 07:29.283
Well, I didn't make you waddle up
four flights of stairs for the heck of it.

07:30.868 --> 07:34.956
You do realize my baby has functioning
organs and can recognize voices.

07:35.123 --> 07:39.794
Yeah, but ours can recognize a specific
data stream among background noise.

07:40.878 --> 07:43.131
Mine has a fully developed immune system.

07:43.714 --> 07:45.341
Ours doesn't need an immune system

07:45.550 --> 07:47.552
because it lives in a state-of-the-art
German incubator.

07:48.636 --> 07:49.637
Sheldon, that's enough.

07:49.804 --> 07:51.055
Oh, well, you know what? Fine.

07:51.222 --> 07:54.559
Let's just agree that both creations
are special in their own way,

07:54.725 --> 07:56.936
and it is foolish to try and compare them.

07:57.103 --> 07:59.814
Although, we didn't need to have sex
with Howard for ours, so we win.

08:04.735 --> 08:06.028
This is fun!

08:08.781 --> 08:11.033
Hey, I've never cleaned a toilet before.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.201
You're kidding.

08:12.368 --> 08:13.911
No, I grew up
with a house full of servants

08:14.078 --> 08:15.163
and now I have a cleaning lady,

08:15.997 --> 08:18.624
who is a lovely woman
who I have great respect for.

08:20.376 --> 08:23.045
It's okay,
you're allowed to have a cleaning lady.

08:23.212 --> 08:26.883
Oh, good, because she also walks my dog,
buys my groceries, and cuts my hair.

08:28.259 --> 08:29.760
I think that's called a mommy.

08:31.846 --> 08:32.847
Uh...

08:33.598 --> 08:36.184
So, forgive me,
forgive me for being nosey,

08:36.350 --> 08:39.312
but is there a wedding ring
under those pretty rubber gloves?

08:39.812 --> 08:40.813
Oh.

08:41.314 --> 08:43.149
No. Not for many years.

08:43.941 --> 08:45.693
Oh, so you are unencumbered?

08:45.860 --> 08:46.944
Just me and my son.

08:47.320 --> 08:49.238
I love kids! How old is he?

08:49.405 --> 08:50.740
Nineteen.

08:52.450 --> 08:53.784
That's a cute age.

08:55.119 --> 08:56.913
They can do so many things.

08:58.664 --> 09:01.125
He's studying to be a lawyer at UCLA.

09:01.667 --> 09:04.295
That's wonderful. A lawyer.
My sister's a lawyer.

09:04.462 --> 09:06.505
Look at that, we have something in common.

09:07.215 --> 09:08.424
Yeah, I guess we do.

09:09.675 --> 09:11.636
Maybe there are other things
we have in common.

09:11.802 --> 09:14.305
Like, come dinnertime,
do you enjoy eating food?

09:16.807 --> 09:18.517
Ay, Rajesh.

09:18.684 --> 09:21.979
I think you're very sweet, but
I work two jobs,

09:22.188 --> 09:23.648
and I don't have time for dating.

09:24.190 --> 09:27.068
Yeah, sure, I understand.
Yeah, I'm very busy, too.

09:27.276 --> 09:30.655
Oh, please, don't take it personal,
I think you're a very nice man.

09:31.822 --> 09:33.324
I think you're very nice as well.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.911
Thank you for helping me.
Good night, Rajesh.

09:37.954 --> 09:39.372
Oh, yes. Oh, Okay.

09:39.538 --> 09:41.916
Uh, good night.

09:47.588 --> 09:51.217
I don't know, maybe it's the fumes
from the urinal cakes,

09:51.384 --> 09:54.345
but I feel like something is happening
between us.

09:54.512 --> 09:56.514
Good night, Rajesh.

09:58.266 --> 10:01.644
Okay, I'll leave, but just know,
every time I come in here

10:01.811 --> 10:02.979
I'll be thinking of you.

10:09.860 --> 10:13.781
Would you look at that?
The image we gave it was 45% white noise,

10:13.990 --> 10:15.866
and it still managed to reconstruct it.

10:16.033 --> 10:17.618
I've never seen results like this before.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.870
Yeah, we need to stop for magnets
on the way home.

10:20.037 --> 10:21.998
This is going right on the fridge.

10:22.873 --> 10:24.500
Aren't you glad you participated in this?

10:24.667 --> 10:27.503
Oh, I am.
And you realize what the next step is.

10:27.670 --> 10:31.465
Set up a second culture
and try to replicate our results.

10:31.757 --> 10:36.053
Uh, no. We lock that door,
lower our underpants a little,

10:36.220 --> 10:37.305
and make a baby.

10:47.189 --> 10:49.567
"Make a baby"? What are you talking about?

10:50.234 --> 10:53.112
Clearly, the combination of our DNA
is exceptional.

10:53.321 --> 10:57.199
Our child could be
the next step in the evolution of mankind.

10:57.366 --> 10:59.994
We'll be able to get
into any preschool we want.

11:01.078 --> 11:02.788
Sheldon, I'm not ready to have a baby.

11:02.955 --> 11:05.166
Oh, yes, you are. I track your cycle.

11:05.416 --> 11:06.417
Hmm?

11:06.584 --> 11:07.877
Yeah, for the next 36 hours,

11:08.044 --> 11:10.588
you're as fertile
as a manure-covered wheat field.

11:13.758 --> 11:17.678
Wow. I can actually feel the egg
crawling its way back up.

11:20.222 --> 11:21.307
I don't understand.

11:21.474 --> 11:23.768
Well, I thought you'd be thrilled
to procreate with me.

11:23.934 --> 11:25.436
Not right now.

11:25.603 --> 11:27.855
Oh, I see what's happening here.

11:28.022 --> 11:29.482
You're playing hard to get.

11:31.609 --> 11:34.779
I'm not playing anything.
We're not making a baby today.

11:35.112 --> 11:36.947
Very well.

11:39.992 --> 11:43.120
Oops. How clumsy of me. You know what?
Let me get that.

11:53.672 --> 11:54.673
Hey...

11:55.299 --> 11:57.718
Where are you going? I...

11:57.885 --> 11:59.095
Did you even look at my bottom?

12:04.850 --> 12:06.143
Welcome.

12:08.813 --> 12:10.314
What is this?

12:10.481 --> 12:12.650
Oh. Well, you said you didn't have time
to go out for dinner,

12:12.817 --> 12:14.318
so I thought we could have one right here.

12:15.152 --> 12:17.905
- Oh, Rajesh...
- Come on, we're in the telescope room.

12:18.072 --> 12:20.366
It'll be like dining under the stars.

12:20.533 --> 12:25.579
You see this double zero? When it says
"01", that means it's twinkling.

12:32.128 --> 12:33.504
Sometimes it takes a while.

12:35.673 --> 12:38.843
Rajesh, this is so sweet,
but you know I'm working.

12:39.009 --> 12:42.012
That's why I already cleaned up in here
and all the other rooms in the hall.

12:46.100 --> 12:47.518
Well, I suppose that gives me
a little time.

12:47.685 --> 12:49.520
Please, sit.

12:49.687 --> 12:52.815
I tried to cook you a meal
from your homeland.

12:52.982 --> 12:55.526
Oh, really? You made Cuban food?

12:57.445 --> 12:59.822
That depends.
Do they have Mexican food in Cuba?

13:04.243 --> 13:09.248
Now, when he said "make a baby",
is it possible he meant out of Legos?

13:10.875 --> 13:14.712
No, he was explicit.
Needlessly and freakishly explicit.

13:17.131 --> 13:18.549
Why does he need a baby?

13:18.716 --> 13:21.302
He's already hairless
and smells like talcum powder.

13:23.429 --> 13:26.765
Could you two really have
some sort of super-intelligent child?

13:26.932 --> 13:30.060
Well, there is a genetic component,
but that doesn't guarantee anything.

13:30.227 --> 13:33.314
That's true. Sheldon's father
once picked a fight with a cactus.

13:34.899 --> 13:36.400
Yeah, but that's just his Earth parents.

13:36.567 --> 13:38.736
We don't know anything
about the ones that sent him here.

13:41.655 --> 13:45.242
Well, you know,
they were smart enough to send him away.

13:45.951 --> 13:48.078
Hey, you're talking about
the person I love

13:48.245 --> 13:50.706
and have been avoiding
for the past three hours.

13:51.874 --> 13:53.584
Oh, man!

13:55.586 --> 13:58.047
Ooh! Is Sheldon gonna get some!

13:59.715 --> 14:03.302
Well, have fun with whatever nightmare's
behind door number two.

14:21.779 --> 14:23.322
Well, hello.

14:25.157 --> 14:26.784
Hello.

14:27.451 --> 14:28.953
Would you care for a brandy?

14:29.119 --> 14:30.287
I don't think so.

14:30.454 --> 14:32.081
Good choice, it's disgusting.

14:34.416 --> 14:37.795
Sheldon, please stop trying to seduce me.

14:37.962 --> 14:39.296
Who's trying to seduce you?

14:39.463 --> 14:42.383
After a long day,
I always turn on smooth jazz

14:42.550 --> 14:45.135
and spray deer musk on my inner thighs.

14:49.515 --> 14:51.809
I thought it smelled
like a petting zoo in here.

14:53.644 --> 14:56.188
Anything you'd like to pet?
But not my hair.

14:56.355 --> 14:57.898
There's a lot of goop in it.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.735
Okay, I've had enough.

15:02.152 --> 15:03.654
Amy, come back!

15:03.821 --> 15:05.656
I don't know how to open the oysters.

15:09.118 --> 15:12.621
So, um, what surprised you the most
when you first came to America?

15:12.788 --> 15:18.002
Well, I suppose how much people care
about Oprah's favorite things.

15:19.211 --> 15:20.629
I thought that, too.

15:20.838 --> 15:23.799
But then I got my first waffle-maker
and never questioned her again.

15:25.467 --> 15:28.512
You know, I do have
some time off this Sunday.

15:28.679 --> 15:29.722
If you'd like, we...

15:29.888 --> 15:32.766
Hey, I saw your car...
Oh, sorry, am I interrupting?

15:33.350 --> 15:35.644
- Uh...
- It's okay, I should get back to work!

15:35.811 --> 15:38.689
- Hi! Howard Wolowitz.
- Oh, Issabella Concepcion.

15:38.856 --> 15:42.359
Oh, yeah, the astronomer.
Raj told us about you.

15:43.068 --> 15:45.112
Hey! Free toilet paper!

15:49.199 --> 15:50.993
You told him I was an astronomer?

15:51.327 --> 15:52.328
Uh...

15:52.536 --> 15:53.912
I understand, time to go.

15:54.079 --> 15:55.205
No, please don't!

15:55.372 --> 15:57.207
It's okay, Rajesh, I'm a grown woman.

15:57.374 --> 15:59.710
I don't have to waste my time with someone
who's embarrassed by me.

16:04.048 --> 16:05.799
I can keep this, right?

16:06.425 --> 16:07.968
Issabella!

16:08.135 --> 16:09.720
Issabella, wait, wait, let me explain.

16:09.928 --> 16:13.140
If you are embarrassed by what I do,
why did you pursue me?

16:13.307 --> 16:14.350
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

16:14.892 --> 16:17.519
Honestly, I didn't think
your job would bother me,

16:17.686 --> 16:20.230
but I guess it did,
and I hate myself for that.

16:20.898 --> 16:23.651
But there's a lot of things about me
that would totally embarrass you.

16:23.817 --> 16:24.943
I doubt that.

16:25.110 --> 16:26.779
Well, prepare to be mortified.

16:28.656 --> 16:31.408
I let my dog eat food out of my mouth
not because she likes it,

16:31.575 --> 16:32.826
but because I do.

16:34.244 --> 16:36.955
Also, I know they're pretty,
but I'm scared of butterflies.

16:37.915 --> 16:39.083
Sorry, just passing through.

16:39.249 --> 16:40.876
I think this fell off your cart.

16:44.421 --> 16:46.924
Come on, what do you say?
Let me make it up to you.

16:48.092 --> 16:49.134
You're very persistent.

16:49.301 --> 16:51.011
It's my one move.

16:53.263 --> 16:54.348
Okay.

16:54.890 --> 16:58.018
This Sunday night, you may take me
to dinner at a nice restaurant.

16:58.977 --> 17:00.437
Great, where would you like to go?

17:01.105 --> 17:03.941
Your choice.
It can be Pakistani food if you like.

17:04.817 --> 17:07.611
- Excuse me, but I'm Indian.
- And now you know how it feels.

17:15.411 --> 17:18.247
So, were you turned on even a little bit?

17:18.414 --> 17:21.333
It was like being hit on
by Rat Pack Pee-Wee Herman.

17:24.753 --> 17:26.380
- I'm sorry, is that a yes?
- No!

17:28.841 --> 17:31.927
Amy, I didn't want it to come to this.

17:32.428 --> 17:34.054
But you have left me no choice

17:34.221 --> 17:38.475
but to employ the most passionate,
seductive dance known to man.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.521
The flamenco.

17:59.663 --> 18:01.498
For God's sake, you're ridiculous.

18:06.170 --> 18:07.963
Well, you guys are aroused, right?

18:12.050 --> 18:13.427
That was a close one.

18:43.373 --> 18:44.374
English - SDH
