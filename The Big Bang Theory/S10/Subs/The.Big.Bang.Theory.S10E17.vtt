00:02.170 --> 00:03.421
<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

00:03.880 --> 00:06.466
My father thinks the reason
I can't make a relationship work

00:06.633 --> 00:07.842
is because I'm spoiled.

00:08.009 --> 00:09.594
All right, how much exactly
does he pay for?

00:12.222 --> 00:15.225
Okay, I'll tell you
but please don't judge me.

00:15.392 --> 00:18.770
He pays for my car,
my rent and my credit cards.

00:21.856 --> 00:23.566
I'm trying, but I'm judging.

00:26.277 --> 00:27.362
Maybe your dad's right.

00:27.529 --> 00:29.614
Yeah, women do like a man
that can support himself.

00:30.448 --> 00:32.075
I have come to an important decision.

00:32.242 --> 00:34.285
I will not be accepting
your money anymore.

00:34.452 --> 00:35.495
<i>That's wonderful!</i>

00:35.704 --> 00:36.705
Yes, that is wonderful,

00:36.871 --> 00:39.290
you will no longer be able
to accuse me of being spoiled.

00:39.541 --> 00:42.210
<i>- I'm so proud of you.</i>
- Dad, I'm trying to tell you off

00:42.377 --> 00:44.838
and you're ruining it
with your delight and relief.

00:48.883 --> 00:49.884
Uh-huh.

00:52.887 --> 00:54.347
Interesting.

00:57.809 --> 00:58.935
Okay.

00:59.102 --> 01:00.103
How bad is it?

01:00.270 --> 01:03.982
Uh, let me put it this way,
do you own a barrel and suspenders?

01:05.734 --> 01:06.735
Are you serious?

01:06.985 --> 01:09.195
I'm not wearing this visor
to play women's golf.

01:11.489 --> 01:12.532
Hi.

01:13.032 --> 01:16.161
Oh, let me guess, you guys are drafting
your fantasy accounting firms.

01:18.747 --> 01:20.540
We're helping Raj figure out his finances.

01:20.790 --> 01:22.667
Aw, he has a job. How bad can it be?

01:22.834 --> 01:25.086
Well, his rent and car lease
are exceedingly high.

01:25.336 --> 01:27.672
You couple that with his penchant for
dining out and shopping...

01:27.922 --> 01:30.341
Wait, wait, not shopping for
clothes, right? Because look.

01:33.303 --> 01:35.513
He also has a remarkable amount
of credit card debt.

01:35.764 --> 01:37.640
I... I thought your dad paid your cards.

01:37.891 --> 01:40.268
I have a card for emergencies
that I pay for myself.

01:40.685 --> 01:42.729
What emergency happened at the LA Zoo?

01:42.937 --> 01:44.397
That's a penguin I sponsor.

01:46.524 --> 01:47.859
They're losing their homes
to global warming,

01:48.026 --> 01:50.904
and my car gets, like,
seven miles a gallon, so I felt bad.

01:52.405 --> 01:53.990
What is "Pink Cheeks"?

01:54.199 --> 01:56.201
It's intimate waxing.
Quit looking at that!

01:58.912 --> 02:02.415
Maybe you should find someone to
help you get your finances under control.

02:02.665 --> 02:03.666
Like a business manager?

02:03.833 --> 02:05.210
Oh, absolutely not.

02:05.376 --> 02:07.337
You can't afford to hire someone
who will forbid you

02:07.504 --> 02:09.464
from spending your money
on foolish expenses.

02:09.631 --> 02:11.925
That is a foolish expense,
and I forbid it.

02:14.719 --> 02:18.014
What if there's someone who just likes
controlling other people

02:18.181 --> 02:19.933
and stealing joy from their lives?

02:21.392 --> 02:22.936
He sounds like a sociopath.

02:24.437 --> 02:26.523
We don't know,
his mother never had him tested.

02:30.193 --> 02:32.320
You're talking about me. Very funny.

02:33.279 --> 02:36.658
Although, I would enjoy
drawing up a budget

02:36.825 --> 02:40.245
and forcing Raj to adhere to it
without an ounce of compassion.

02:40.411 --> 02:42.539
Wait, wait, who's gonna break it
to the penguin?

02:45.166 --> 02:46.459
Okay, Sheldon.

02:46.626 --> 02:48.253
Yeah, I'm putting you in charge
of my finances.

02:48.419 --> 02:50.713
I will not spend another penny
that you don't authorize.

02:51.130 --> 02:52.173
Very well.

02:52.340 --> 02:55.510
Hey, Comic-Con tickets go on sale
this Friday, you can't buy one.

02:58.555 --> 03:00.014
Better luck next time, pink cheeks.

03:28.877 --> 03:30.503
You're actually going to Comic-Con?

03:30.962 --> 03:32.964
Well, Leonard wants me to do
more stuff like that with him,

03:33.131 --> 03:34.674
so I thought maybe this year
I'd tag along.

03:35.091 --> 03:36.885
Well, that's sweet. I bet you'll have fun.

03:37.135 --> 03:38.219
So, do you wanna come?

03:39.012 --> 03:41.806
No, thanks. I already live in a place
all the nerds come to.

03:43.725 --> 03:46.227
Please? I went to your boring thing
last month.

03:47.562 --> 03:49.439
My aunt's funeral?

03:50.815 --> 03:53.318
Come on, even you checked your email
during the eulogy.

03:54.861 --> 03:58.072
Well, I'm not going,
but I do think it's nice you want to.

03:58.489 --> 04:01.326
It's not that I want to go,
I just think it'll make Leonard happy.

04:01.826 --> 04:05.121
And if I have to watch him squeeze into
an Ewok costume, so be it.

04:06.372 --> 04:09.250
Look at you, going to Comic-Con,
talking about Ewoks.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.085
I really have become the cool one
around here.

04:14.881 --> 04:17.175
You actually think Penny will have fun
at Comic-Con?

04:17.467 --> 04:21.012
No, which will make me miserable,
which is usually Sheldon's job.

04:24.098 --> 04:25.892
She's gonna hate waiting in line
for the panels.

04:26.184 --> 04:27.769
And hate all the crowds at the panels.

04:27.936 --> 04:29.354
She's gonna hate the panels.

04:30.855 --> 04:33.524
She's gonna hate how often
we say the word "panels."

04:34.692 --> 04:35.985
Why don't you just tell her not to come?

04:36.152 --> 04:38.446
Oh, she's so excited.
I can't do that to her.

04:38.655 --> 04:41.282
Well, what if you make it sound so bad,
she won't wanna go?

04:42.367 --> 04:43.701
That I would do to her.

04:45.954 --> 04:48.039
I can't believe Penny is gonna get to go
and I'm not.

04:48.539 --> 04:50.375
You can always watch the panels online.

04:50.541 --> 04:52.377
Oh, boy, we do say that a lot.

04:53.962 --> 04:55.213
Panels.

04:59.550 --> 05:00.927
Just wanted to be included.

05:03.888 --> 05:05.473
Come on, Sheldon, it's Comic-Con!

05:05.640 --> 05:08.226
Just let me have the money for this,
and I won't ask for anything else.

05:08.393 --> 05:10.436
You put me in charge of your finances.

05:10.603 --> 05:12.730
If you wanted someone weak and spineless
you could walk all over,

05:12.897 --> 05:14.107
you should have asked Leonard.

05:15.984 --> 05:17.151
See? Miserable.

05:18.152 --> 05:20.655
Okay, you're right,
I got myself into this.

05:20.822 --> 05:22.615
But I've never missed a Comic-Con
with you guys.

05:22.865 --> 05:24.909
Your father may have spoiled you,
but I won't.

05:25.076 --> 05:26.285
Now, if you want a ticket to Comic-Con,

05:26.452 --> 05:28.454
I suggest you figure out a way
to earn the money yourself.

05:28.746 --> 05:31.624
Yeah, you're a grown man
who's highly educated.

05:31.791 --> 05:34.002
Uh, you could charge people money
to punch you.

05:37.046 --> 05:38.047
Go ahead, make jokes.

05:38.214 --> 05:40.758
I don't know why you think you're going
to Comic-Con, you just had a baby.

05:41.592 --> 05:42.677
- So?
- What... So?

05:42.844 --> 05:44.429
What, so you think Bernadette's
just gonna let you

05:44.595 --> 05:47.849
jet down to San Diego for five days
and leave her alone?

05:48.016 --> 05:49.017
<i>Hang on.</i>

05:49.183 --> 05:50.768
So, I have to bring Penny,

05:50.935 --> 05:52.729
you can't afford it,
Howard's gonna get in trouble,

05:52.895 --> 05:54.689
and this guy gets to have a great time.

05:56.566 --> 05:57.734
I'm gonna go as Dumbledore.

06:03.614 --> 06:05.783
- How's my favorite girl?
- Okay.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.202
- What you doing?
- Making lasagna.

06:08.411 --> 06:12.915
Mmm! She's sexy, she can cook.
Such a lucky guy.

06:13.332 --> 06:16.169
You want something stupid
or you did something stupid?

06:17.462 --> 06:19.255
No! I just walked in here,

06:19.422 --> 06:22.216
saw how beautiful you are,
and had to tell you.

06:22.383 --> 06:24.635
Oh, dear God,
you're cheating on me with Raj.

06:26.971 --> 06:28.431
Never gets old.

06:31.601 --> 06:34.979
Okay, there is something I want,
but it's not a big deal.

06:35.313 --> 06:36.314
What is it?

06:36.481 --> 06:38.149
Well, Comic-Con tickets go on sale
this Friday,

06:38.316 --> 06:39.400
and I was hoping I could go with the guys.

06:39.567 --> 06:40.568
But before you say anything,

06:40.735 --> 06:43.654
I'll make up for being gone
by doing everything around here.

06:43.821 --> 06:45.490
I mean, everything.
I'm even gonna answer for you.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.325
"Yes, Howie, you can go."

06:49.243 --> 06:50.703
It's so hard to say no to you.

06:51.496 --> 06:52.580
Thank you!

06:53.915 --> 06:55.208
So I'll say "maybe."

06:56.959 --> 06:58.294
What? Why?

06:58.586 --> 07:00.671
Well, you said tickets don't go on sale
till Friday, right?

07:01.172 --> 07:02.215
Yeah?

07:02.507 --> 07:04.425
You said you're gonna do
all this stuff for me, right?

07:05.843 --> 07:06.928
Yeah.

07:09.555 --> 07:10.807
See where I'm going with this?

07:13.935 --> 07:15.019
Yeah.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.816
If you don't know how to make lasagna,
Google does.

07:23.986 --> 07:27.365
Okay, so, this is the
main Comic-Con floor.

07:27.532 --> 07:29.826
It's where all the vendors
and exhibits are.

07:29.992 --> 07:32.370
Wow! That is a lot of people
jammed in there.

07:32.787 --> 07:33.830
I know!

07:33.996 --> 07:37.792
Sometimes, Howard wears a striped shirt
so we can play "Where's Wolowitz?"

07:41.420 --> 07:45.341
Okay, now, this is us camping out
in line for the <i>Avengers</i> panel.

07:45.508 --> 07:47.552
Oh, you really
sleep on the sidewalk, huh?

07:47.718 --> 07:50.429
Yeah. It can get chilly,

07:50.680 --> 07:53.099
but, uh, Raj figured out that
if you pee in a bottle

07:53.266 --> 07:56.269
and put it in your sleeping bag,
it helps keep you warm.

07:58.604 --> 08:00.439
Here's the hotel room we all share.

08:00.606 --> 08:02.817
Well, you and I would
get our own room, right?

08:03.276 --> 08:04.652
Every hotel is booked.

08:04.819 --> 08:08.072
But see this space here,
between Sheldon's feet and my head?

08:08.239 --> 08:09.532
That's where you go.

08:11.075 --> 08:12.076
Well, it's no different than

08:12.243 --> 08:15.705
when Sheldon used to climb in bed with us
during a thunderstorm.

08:16.914 --> 08:19.083
Don't worry, we won't be doing
much sleeping, anyway.

08:19.250 --> 08:20.626
It's like an all-night party.

08:20.793 --> 08:23.921
There's trivia contests
and <i>Dungeons & Dragons.</i>

08:24.589 --> 08:27.300
As we like to say,
"It's off the chain mail."

08:29.427 --> 08:32.597
I even said "off the chain mail!"
And she still wants to go.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.058
That's probably my fault.

08:36.225 --> 08:38.644
She may have heard about
my cool Dumbledore costume.

08:40.771 --> 08:42.315
Okay, I can give you 20 bucks
for the whole box.

08:43.441 --> 08:45.568
But you charged me hundreds
for this stuff!

08:45.818 --> 08:48.029
I know. And I did it with a straight face.

08:50.114 --> 08:53.618
But I need to earn enough money
so I can go to Comic-Con.

08:56.245 --> 08:57.288
All right.

08:57.788 --> 09:00.625
I'll give you 25 bucks,
that's my best offer.

09:01.792 --> 09:02.793
I have no choice.

09:03.377 --> 09:06.172
You know, if you wanna make extra money,
I could throw some work your way.

09:06.464 --> 09:08.424
- Really? I'll do anything.
- Great, you're hired.

09:08.633 --> 09:10.509
First thing you can do
is put price tags on these.

09:10.801 --> 09:12.345
Start the little ones at $50.

09:16.599 --> 09:19.435
You know, it's no big deal.
I can put up with anything for three days.

09:19.769 --> 09:22.146
- Comic-Con's five days.
- Are you kidding me?

09:24.815 --> 09:26.442
Why don't you just tell him
you don't wanna go?

09:26.609 --> 09:28.486
No, I can't, it'll break his heart.

09:28.653 --> 09:31.572
He's always making an effort
to do things with me he doesn't enjoy.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.282
Like going outside.

09:34.700 --> 09:35.993
He is an indoor cat.

09:37.578 --> 09:38.996
Maybe it won't be that bad.

09:39.163 --> 09:40.790
Leonard says it's really mainstream now.

09:41.332 --> 09:43.167
Comic books aren't just
for sad nerds anymore.

09:59.517 --> 10:02.061
I mean, it is still
a key part of their demographic.

10:10.820 --> 10:12.530
<i>Howie, can you get that?</i>

10:12.697 --> 10:13.781
<i>Kinda busy!</i>

10:14.699 --> 10:17.994
<i>Busy like I'll be
with the baby if you go to San Diego?</i>

10:20.663 --> 10:21.747
Hey.

10:24.041 --> 10:25.042
What's with the gloves?

10:25.209 --> 10:27.211
They complete my ensemble.
What do you want?

10:29.505 --> 10:30.589
I'm looking to make extra money,

10:30.756 --> 10:32.633
and was wondering if you had any chores
I could do.

10:33.551 --> 10:34.635
Hang on.

10:34.802 --> 10:39.015
Bernie, can I outsource my chores
to an Indian guy?

10:41.851 --> 10:43.060
<i>No!</i>

10:43.519 --> 10:44.520
I tried.

10:48.482 --> 10:51.444
Hey, I was thinking,
if you wanna do a couples costume,

10:51.610 --> 10:54.280
we could paint ourselves green
and be Hulk and She-Hulk.

10:54.447 --> 10:58.409
Or we could paint ourselves blue
and go as Nightcrawler and Mystique.

11:00.494 --> 11:02.747
Is there any scenario
where we're not in full-body paint?

11:03.873 --> 11:06.500
Yeah, if you want us to look like losers.

11:06.876 --> 11:09.837
So, hey, um, are you sure
the guys are okay with me coming?

11:10.379 --> 11:11.422
Yeah, of course. Why?

11:12.089 --> 11:14.091
This is just something
you usually do together,

11:14.258 --> 11:15.801
and if I'm screwing it up,
I don't have to go.

11:16.969 --> 11:19.430
Oh, why, do you... You not wanna go?

11:21.599 --> 11:23.309
Why, do you not want me to go?

11:25.311 --> 11:26.604
No, I want you to go.

11:29.148 --> 11:30.358
Okay, good.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.443
Because that's what I want, too.

11:37.114 --> 11:39.909
Now we're going as Hulk and She-Hulk!

11:42.203 --> 11:44.121
I don't wanna take my shirt off
at Comic-Con!

11:44.997 --> 11:47.708
If I may speak for Comic-Con,
"We don't want that, either."

11:49.668 --> 11:50.669
Is that nice?

11:50.836 --> 11:52.088
No, but it's honest,

11:52.254 --> 11:54.924
and it sounds like you could use a
little more honesty in your relationship.

11:55.341 --> 11:57.134
Uh, it's more complicated than that.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.136
I'm always honest with Amy.

11:59.303 --> 12:01.097
The other day, she said
she was self-conscious

12:01.263 --> 12:03.224
about the beauty mark on her shoulder.

12:03.391 --> 12:05.601
And I said, "You can call that
a beauty mark all you want.

12:05.768 --> 12:08.562
"When there's hair growing out of it,
that's a mole."

12:10.648 --> 12:12.233
Do you think she's as honest with you?

12:12.775 --> 12:13.818
Well, I should hope so.

12:13.984 --> 12:17.738
When she called me an insensitive jerk,
I'd like to think she meant it.

12:20.825 --> 12:23.452
There's gotta be other ways
you can make a quick buck.

12:23.661 --> 12:24.662
Yeah, you'd think.

12:25.162 --> 12:27.623
Oh, maybe I could sell my blood and sperm!

12:31.377 --> 12:34.338
I really should wear a bell around my neck
so you guys can hear me coming.

12:35.214 --> 12:37.800
- Here, let me help you.
- Thank you.

12:38.008 --> 12:41.095
Oh, double-stuffed Oreos,
I remember when I could afford you.

12:43.013 --> 12:45.683
- Ugh, there she goes.
- Wait, stay, I'll get her.

12:46.225 --> 12:49.520
- I appreciate it.
- That's fine. She and I can cry together.

12:51.188 --> 12:52.231
He's such a sweetie.

12:52.857 --> 12:55.734
I know. I wish there was some way
we could help him.

12:56.318 --> 12:59.071
If he could find a girl with a job,
all his problems would be over.

12:59.238 --> 13:01.157
Yep, that's working out great for me.

13:05.703 --> 13:07.163
Penny says they're ready to go.

13:07.580 --> 13:11.250
Very well,
prepare for a long night of deceit.

13:12.126 --> 13:15.921
Sheldon, women can wear makeup,
it's not lying!

13:18.048 --> 13:19.425
I was talking about Leonard.

13:19.884 --> 13:22.887
And if makeup is so truthful,
why is it called "concealer"?

13:24.930 --> 13:26.765
Wait, wait, wait,
what's Leonard lying about?

13:27.141 --> 13:28.726
He doesn't really want Penny
to go to Comic-Con,

13:28.893 --> 13:30.311
he's just doing it to make her happy.

13:31.437 --> 13:32.521
Really?

13:32.688 --> 13:36.233
Because she doesn't actually want to go,
she's just doing it to make him happy.

13:37.067 --> 13:38.777
So, they're both trying to
make each other happy,

13:38.944 --> 13:41.614
and the end result is
they make each other sad?

13:42.907 --> 13:44.074
That's hilarious.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.037
I can't wait to tell them.

13:49.079 --> 13:51.832
No, you're not gonna tell them anything.
You're gonna stay out of it.

13:52.416 --> 13:54.543
- Why?
- Because it's between them.

13:55.085 --> 13:59.131
Well, if you haven't noticed, I've been
between them for the last 10 years.

14:00.758 --> 14:01.759
Hey.

14:01.926 --> 14:02.927
- Hello.
- Hi.

14:03.093 --> 14:04.845
- Hey babe, you wanna drive?
- Sure. Or you can.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.264
No, it's fine.
I know you don't like the way I drive.

14:07.431 --> 14:09.099
I don't have a problem with your driving.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.436
Are you listening to this?
They deceive each other about everything.

14:12.603 --> 14:13.604
Shh.

14:16.440 --> 14:19.568
Just so you know,
that guy in the parking lot hit me.

14:20.194 --> 14:22.154
He wasn't in a car, but okay.

14:24.490 --> 14:25.866
Just say you wanna drive.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.451
I honestly don't.

14:31.121 --> 14:33.624
Amy, do us a favor, please drive.

14:33.791 --> 14:34.959
Sure, happy to.

14:35.125 --> 14:36.335
If you wanna drive, just drive!

14:36.502 --> 14:38.212
I don't see why this has to be
so complicated.

14:38.379 --> 14:40.381
It's not complicated!
Amy's driving, that's it!

14:40.548 --> 14:42.299
That's not it,
because you're clearly upset.

14:42.466 --> 14:44.009
You're the one who seems upset.

14:44.176 --> 14:45.177
Why would I be upset?

14:45.344 --> 14:47.221
Because you don't want her
to go to Comic-Con!

14:50.474 --> 14:52.768
This is an interesting way
to stay out of it.

14:55.312 --> 14:56.981
Wait, you don't want me to go?

14:57.147 --> 15:00.109
Well, I just don't think
you're gonna have a good time.

15:00.401 --> 15:03.821
Yeah, well, get this! Neither does Penny,
that's why she doesn't want to go.

15:05.948 --> 15:07.700
You set 'em up, I knock 'em down.
Good job.

15:09.660 --> 15:11.829
Why would you say you wanted to go
if you didn't?

15:11.996 --> 15:13.497
I just thought it would make you happy.

15:13.664 --> 15:17.042
Okay, hold on,
so if you don't want to go,

15:17.209 --> 15:18.919
and I don't need to bring you,

15:19.753 --> 15:20.879
is everything good?

15:21.589 --> 15:23.966
Hold on, I'm trying to decide
if I'm mad at you.

15:26.135 --> 15:27.845
No, I'm happy, I don't have to go!

15:29.054 --> 15:31.181
- Okay, problem solved. Yeah.
- Okay.

15:31.432 --> 15:33.517
Not entirely. The fight over
who's going to drive is still going...

15:33.684 --> 15:35.185
Oh, my God, stop talking!

15:38.397 --> 15:40.399
The place looks great.
Did you guys get a maid?

15:41.191 --> 15:42.359
Kinda.

15:44.069 --> 15:45.195
Dinner's almost ready.

15:45.362 --> 15:49.742
If you like meatloaf, I'm sure you'll like
its cousin, bowl of meat.

15:52.244 --> 15:55.789
If you're still looking to make money,
I will pay you to burn that jacket.

15:58.917 --> 16:02.087
Thank you, but it doesn't look like
I'm going to Comic-Con this year.

16:02.546 --> 16:05.591
Well, with as much debt as you have,
probably not next year, either.

16:08.052 --> 16:09.553
- Howie?
- Sure.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.347
This is for you.

16:13.098 --> 16:14.099
What's this?

16:14.266 --> 16:17.645
It's back pay for all the babysitting
and taking care of Halley you've done.

16:18.062 --> 16:20.898
There's more than enough in there
to cover Comic-Con.

16:21.273 --> 16:23.734
Um, I also take care of Halley.

16:25.611 --> 16:27.571
And you live here for free.

16:28.405 --> 16:30.282
I do, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am.

16:31.742 --> 16:34.995
This is so generous of you.
I don't know what to say.

16:35.371 --> 16:36.372
Now you can come with us!

16:36.538 --> 16:38.874
Yeah, there's room in the bed
by Sheldon's feet.

16:41.418 --> 16:43.462
As much as I appreciate this,
I can't accept it.

16:43.796 --> 16:46.799
Okay? Halley's my goddaughter,
I don't take care of her for money.

16:47.257 --> 16:48.342
I would.

16:52.346 --> 16:53.681
Keep it, consider it a gift.

16:53.972 --> 16:56.600
Hold on!
Is it back pay or is it a gift?

16:56.934 --> 16:57.935
What's the difference?

16:58.102 --> 16:59.853
When the IRS questions us
in separate rooms,

17:00.020 --> 17:01.313
we need to have our stories straight.

17:02.606 --> 17:04.650
It doesn't matter, I'm not keeping this.

17:04.817 --> 17:06.735
I'm trying to pay my own way
and be responsible.

17:06.902 --> 17:08.570
Taking handouts won't help that.

17:09.113 --> 17:10.531
So you're not going to Comic-Con?

17:10.781 --> 17:12.908
I've been plenty of times.

17:13.450 --> 17:15.619
If I miss one, it's fine. I'm a big boy.

17:16.620 --> 17:20.040
I'm a big boy, and if I missed one,
I'd throw a big boy tantrum.

17:22.501 --> 17:24.962
You know what? I've gone 12 times.

17:25.129 --> 17:26.672
Maybe I'll sit out this year, too.

17:26.839 --> 17:27.840
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:28.215 --> 17:30.050
Maybe you and I can do
something fun that weekend.

17:30.342 --> 17:32.052
Ooh! How about whitewater rafting?

17:33.637 --> 17:36.807
How about we compromise and go
on the Small World ride at Disneyland?

17:40.060 --> 17:42.312
You know what? I'm not gonna go, either.

17:42.730 --> 17:46.442
I'm a father now.
I'd rather spend time with my family.

17:47.359 --> 17:48.610
You just don't wanna go alone
with Sheldon.

17:48.777 --> 17:50.362
I'm gonna go check on dinner.

17:53.282 --> 17:56.160
Sounds like everyone's staying home.
What do you say?

17:57.327 --> 17:59.079
Nuts to that! I'm going to Comic-Con!

18:00.664 --> 18:01.665
By yourself?

18:02.124 --> 18:03.125
Not necessarily.

18:03.292 --> 18:05.544
I have four months to find
some new friends.

18:06.211 --> 18:07.337
I'll go with you.

18:07.671 --> 18:09.089
That's very kind of you, Stuart.

18:09.506 --> 18:11.175
Check back in with me in July.

18:19.683 --> 18:21.894
There's my pretty girlfriend.

18:24.897 --> 18:27.024
I'm not going with you to Comic-Con.

18:27.191 --> 18:28.233
You... What?

18:28.400 --> 18:30.652
Can't a man just be happy to see his woman

18:30.819 --> 18:34.531
and pat her on her second-most
erogenous ball-and-socket joint?

18:38.202 --> 18:40.537
He can,
but it's still not changing my mind.

18:42.414 --> 18:45.042
Well, maybe what's in my pants
will change your mind.

18:50.047 --> 18:52.216
It's a list of this year's panelists.

18:57.095 --> 18:58.388
It's long, isn't it?

19:29.253 --> 19:30.254
English - SDH
