WEBVTT

00:03.755 --> 00:05.423
If we're going to be
staying in this apartment,

00:05.590 --> 00:08.051
would you be interested
in doing a little redecorating?

00:09.469 --> 00:12.138
Oh, actually, I would.

00:12.555 --> 00:14.224
Great, what'd you have in mind?

00:14.849 --> 00:17.644
Let's take every single thing
from the other apartment,

00:17.852 --> 00:19.062
and put it in here.

00:20.438 --> 00:22.065
Well, how about we start a little smaller?

00:22.232 --> 00:24.192
Like moving the furniture around.

00:25.777 --> 00:28.530
You know, I have always thought that
this couch would look fantastic

00:28.738 --> 00:30.198
on the curb in front of the building.

00:32.367 --> 00:35.245
Look, we can't just throw away
Penny's stuff,

00:35.453 --> 00:37.956
but we can ask
if she wants any of it back.

00:39.874 --> 00:42.669
You know, I wonder how she feels
about all this artwork.

00:43.420 --> 00:46.214
Well, I'm sure she misses this one.

00:46.381 --> 00:49.134
I mean, it's the greatest gift
I've ever given anybody.

00:56.307 --> 00:59.644
It truly does capture the beauty
of your friendship with Penny.

01:01.271 --> 01:03.314
It may have appreciated in value.

01:03.648 --> 01:05.817
You know, the artist killed himself
shortly after painting that.

01:07.861 --> 01:10.488
Yeah, it seems only right
that she have it back.

01:11.740 --> 01:14.617
Can't wait to see the look on
her face when I give it to her again.

01:21.249 --> 01:23.585
Look, it's the same smile
she has in the painting.

01:51.696 --> 01:54.365
Yeah, there's hooks in the closet,
I can hang it right now.

01:54.532 --> 01:56.201
Oh, no, no, those hooks are gone.

01:56.576 --> 01:57.702
What happened to them?

01:57.911 --> 02:01.372
Uh, we ran out of candy on Halloween,
I was just giving everything away.

02:03.833 --> 02:06.044
Hey, guys, what are you...
Oh, that's here, cool.

02:08.254 --> 02:09.422
Amy wants me to have it.

02:09.631 --> 02:11.257
Well, it would be selfish of me
to keep it.

02:11.716 --> 02:13.343
But it's a picture of you.

02:13.551 --> 02:14.636
And you.

02:16.221 --> 02:17.305
But you commissioned it.

02:17.555 --> 02:18.681
To give to you.

02:20.099 --> 02:21.559
But you like it so much.

02:22.018 --> 02:23.102
So do you.

02:25.438 --> 02:27.232
- I seem to be losing.
- Yes, you do.

02:29.025 --> 02:30.860
You know, Leonard,
the more I think about it,

02:31.027 --> 02:33.571
there are a number of mutually owned items
in this apartment

02:33.738 --> 02:34.906
that you and I should go through.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.533
For example,

02:37.450 --> 02:39.285
who gets our beloved sword, Longclaw?

02:39.494 --> 02:40.495
Why don't you keep it?

02:40.745 --> 02:42.580
That seems fair,
we did just give you the painting.

02:44.040 --> 02:47.085
Yeah, I don't need anything around
that I can stab myself with.

02:47.752 --> 02:50.004
How wonderful, Longclaw is mine.

02:50.171 --> 02:53.758
And how about you keep our avocado plant?

02:58.221 --> 03:00.515
Sounds right,
a limited edition collectible

03:00.723 --> 03:02.433
worth hundreds of dollars,

03:02.600 --> 03:05.770
and a thing that grew out of a thing
we fished from the trash.

03:06.980 --> 03:09.274
Although, Amy and I did just
move in together,

03:09.440 --> 03:11.693
and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift.

03:12.819 --> 03:14.070
Fine, take the plant.

03:14.279 --> 03:16.906
Oh, we got a sword and a plant.
Our apartment's really shaping up.

03:21.077 --> 03:23.288
Stuart, you didn't have to get us
a baby gift.

03:23.621 --> 03:27.542
Just homemade coupons for things you might
need help with before the baby gets here.

03:28.042 --> 03:30.712
Going to the grocery store,
driving you to the doctor.

03:30.879 --> 03:33.131
If you're not in a hurry,
I can dig you a koi pond.

03:36.384 --> 03:37.677
A foot massage?

03:37.844 --> 03:40.513
And that's not me being creepy,
that's for either of you.

03:43.516 --> 03:45.518
This is very nice, Stuart, thank you.

03:47.186 --> 03:49.272
How come this one's on the back
of an eviction notice?

03:49.606 --> 03:54.277
Oh, yeah. Now that you mention it,
can I live here?

03:58.156 --> 04:00.658
Stuart, we'd love to help you out,
but this a bad time.

04:00.825 --> 04:02.118
We're about to have a baby.

04:02.285 --> 04:04.996
Or is that why this is a great time?
Think about it.

04:05.455 --> 04:08.082
When that baby comes, you're gonna need
all the help you can get.

04:08.833 --> 04:11.419
Thank you, but I'm not really sure.

04:12.170 --> 04:14.172
Hang on, maybe it's not the worst idea.

04:14.339 --> 04:17.133
I mean, he did do a good job
taking care of my mother.

04:17.425 --> 04:20.845
That woman didn't get heat rash once
with me on powder patrol.

04:23.723 --> 04:27.435
Hey, I guess you could stay for a few days
and we'll see how it goes.

04:27.727 --> 04:31.856
Thank you. And it's only temporary,
just till I get back on my feet,

04:32.440 --> 04:35.026
or the baby goes off to college,
whichever happens first.

04:38.112 --> 04:39.447
When would you move in?

04:39.781 --> 04:43.868
Well, my car broke down in your driveway,
so I'm gonna say now.

04:45.453 --> 04:50.375
But I am ready to be helpful.
In fact, gonna go vacuum.

04:50.875 --> 04:53.378
Mmm. Actually I just did that
this morning.

04:54.212 --> 04:56.297
Okay. Then I'll dust.

04:56.547 --> 04:57.757
I did that, too.

04:59.133 --> 05:01.803
Then I'll check the batteries
in the smoke detectors.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.138
Howard just did that.

05:04.305 --> 05:05.765
Yeah, let him do it.

05:12.063 --> 05:14.899
Remember when we got this at Comic-Con?

05:15.358 --> 05:18.194
Oh, yeah. The Mr. Spock cuckoo clock.

05:19.404 --> 05:22.824
<i>Live long and prosper.
Live long and prosper.</i>

05:23.032 --> 05:26.536
<i>Live long and prosper.
Live long and prosper.</i>

05:26.911 --> 05:28.246
It's one of a kind.

05:29.455 --> 05:31.457
So if it breaks there'd be none of it?

05:33.501 --> 05:36.004
Well, Leonard, who should keep this?

05:36.170 --> 05:39.340
On the one hand, I love Mr. Spock
more than you do.

05:39.590 --> 05:43.052
But on the other hand,
I care more about clocks than you do.

05:43.511 --> 05:44.846
So you think you should keep it?

05:45.013 --> 05:48.266
I'll be right across the hall.
You'll probably be able to hear it.

05:50.893 --> 05:51.894
Keep the clock, Sheldon.

05:52.061 --> 05:53.479
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

05:53.646 --> 05:54.772
Thank you?

05:56.482 --> 06:01.154
Oh. Now, what about our 3-D chess set?

06:01.446 --> 06:02.447
Let me guess, you want it.

06:02.613 --> 06:05.283
Well, no, I just didn't think you'd want
a physical reminder

06:05.450 --> 06:07.744
of a game you never managed to win.

06:07.910 --> 06:10.455
As a kindness,
I should probably take all the games.

06:11.622 --> 06:13.082
You know what, Sheldon, take it.

06:13.249 --> 06:15.960
In fact, you can have everything.
I really don't care.

06:16.544 --> 06:20.298
Are you sure? These items represent
our shared times together.

06:20.548 --> 06:21.924
- Well, now they're yours.
- Leonard...

06:22.133 --> 06:23.468
Well, you know what's gonna happen.

06:23.634 --> 06:26.304
He's just gonna come up with some reason
why everything should be his.

06:26.471 --> 06:30.141
For a man so good at predicting my moves,
how come you stink at 3-D chess?

06:32.018 --> 06:33.978
Sheldon, you're being a little selfish.

06:34.145 --> 06:35.980
Why don't you let Leonard
keep a few things?

06:36.147 --> 06:39.150
It's not my fault I'm bad at sharing,
I skipped kindergarten.

06:40.318 --> 06:43.321
You know what?
There is one thing I would like.

06:43.905 --> 06:45.656
Take whatever you want.

06:45.907 --> 06:50.328
I would like to keep
the official flag of our apartment.

06:52.580 --> 06:53.831
But you don't even like flags.

06:53.998 --> 06:55.208
I like this one.

06:57.877 --> 06:59.545
But I designed it.

06:59.754 --> 07:04.467
But you made me order it because you were
"too well-known in the flag community

07:04.634 --> 07:06.302
"and they'd jack up the price."

07:07.845 --> 07:10.139
But you don't even understand
its symbolism.

07:10.348 --> 07:14.185
Oh, I do. The field of blue represents
you being miserable,

07:14.352 --> 07:17.772
and the lion sticking its tongue out
means I'm happy about it.

07:22.110 --> 07:24.195
Come along, Amy.

07:24.529 --> 07:26.614
I know when I'm not wanted.

07:28.241 --> 07:30.243
I don't think you do, but all right.

07:35.206 --> 07:36.624
Stuart, you cooked?

07:36.999 --> 07:38.584
How did you know it wasn't me?

07:38.751 --> 07:41.838
There's only three people in this house,
and you'd still be my fifth guess.

07:44.632 --> 07:47.009
That's Raj.

07:47.176 --> 07:49.137
You guys relax, I'll get it.

07:49.679 --> 07:52.473
Have some bread while it's still warm...

07:53.224 --> 07:56.561
It's like we have a butler.
If I had a Batsuit I'd be Bruce Wayne.

07:58.521 --> 07:59.939
You have a Batsuit.

08:01.732 --> 08:03.276
It's pajamas, there's no cape.

08:06.237 --> 08:08.823
- Hey, Raj.
- Hey, Stuart. What are you doing here?

08:09.073 --> 08:10.408
Oh, I'm living here again.

08:10.616 --> 08:12.118
Do Howard and Bernadette know?

08:14.245 --> 08:16.706
Or is it like a possum in the walls
kind of thing?

08:18.708 --> 08:21.252
No, I needed a place to stay and,

08:21.419 --> 08:23.963
with the baby coming,
I figured they could use some extra help.

08:24.839 --> 08:26.215
Okay, cool.

08:26.424 --> 08:27.758
Anyway, come on in, dinner's ready.

08:28.009 --> 08:30.511
- Oh, but I bought Chinese takeout.
- Oh.

08:30.761 --> 08:34.765
Okay. Well, if Bernadette wants her ankles
to swell up even more,

08:34.932 --> 08:36.225
she can have that.

08:40.980 --> 08:42.940
Is the Wi-Fi working for you?

08:43.149 --> 08:44.442
Uh, hang on.

08:45.401 --> 08:48.613
I don't think so, I'm clicking on
"One weird trick for a flat belly,"

08:48.821 --> 08:51.282
but I'm still seeing
"Celebrities who look like their pets."

08:54.368 --> 08:57.163
- I knew it, Sheldon changed the password.
- Are you sure?

08:57.413 --> 09:01.334
Well, the new network name is,
"Ha, ha, ha, now I've got you."

09:04.629 --> 09:07.298
So, it's either Sheldon
or Gargamel from <i>The Smurfs.</i>

09:08.633 --> 09:09.634
What a jerk.

09:09.842 --> 09:11.969
You're good at revenge.
How do we get him back?

09:12.136 --> 09:15.890
Well, my go-to move is usually
sleep with the person's boyfriend,

09:16.265 --> 09:18.643
but I kind of feel like
I'm already doing that.

09:25.650 --> 09:28.569
Sheldon, I know what you did,
now change the password back.

09:30.529 --> 09:33.532
Well, powder me in sugar
and call me a donut,

09:33.741 --> 09:35.493
if it isn't Leonard Hofstadter.

09:37.078 --> 09:39.830
Sheldon, I'm warning you,
I can play this game, too.

09:40.081 --> 09:41.707
If it's like your 3-D chess game,

09:41.874 --> 09:43.876
then you're out of your length, width
and depth.

09:45.836 --> 09:49.006
Amy, get the Neosporin,
somebody just got burned.

09:51.467 --> 09:53.678
All right, I tried.

09:54.136 --> 09:55.680
"All right, I tried."

09:55.846 --> 09:57.848
That should be
the title of your autobiography.

09:59.350 --> 10:01.644
Ooh, a second-degree burn.

10:03.521 --> 10:05.106
I've got the Neosporin. Who got hurt?

10:06.482 --> 10:08.109
It's a good thing you're cute.

10:16.867 --> 10:18.786
So, I was reading how it's a good idea

10:18.995 --> 10:21.998
for new parents
to take an infant CPR class.

10:22.248 --> 10:23.916
Yeah, we've been meaning to do that.

10:24.250 --> 10:27.169
Oh, I know a CPR instructor
who'll come to the house.

10:27.378 --> 10:29.130
- That'd be great.
- I'll give him a call.

10:29.380 --> 10:31.924
We met when I was sleeping on the beach
and he thought I was dead.

10:35.219 --> 10:36.554
Thank you again for cooking.

10:36.721 --> 10:38.556
It's getting tough for me
to be on my feet all day.

10:38.848 --> 10:41.851
You just kick back and relax.
I've got it all under control.

10:42.560 --> 10:45.604
Although it was already under control.

10:46.397 --> 10:48.482
I'm sorry, you mumbled something?

10:50.401 --> 10:53.195
It's just that they've had plenty of help.

10:53.571 --> 10:55.781
Well, you know what they say,
it takes a village.

10:56.073 --> 10:58.159
Well, they already had a village.

10:59.452 --> 11:02.330
I noticed the village couldn't find time
to put the crib together.

11:03.039 --> 11:05.249
Yeah, well, maybe the village was too busy

11:05.458 --> 11:07.877
checking out the local Montessori school
for the new arrival.

11:08.044 --> 11:10.129
You mean the one with
the empty beer bottles in the sandbox?

11:10.296 --> 11:11.297
We'll pass, thank you.

11:13.924 --> 11:15.634
Do something, Batman.

11:20.598 --> 11:22.767
Hey.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.521
What do you think you're doing?

11:27.730 --> 11:29.231
Separating my delicates.

11:31.567 --> 11:33.361
This is the level you're stooping to?

11:33.611 --> 11:38.282
No. This is the level I am stooping to.

11:42.912 --> 11:46.457
I believe that is
flag to crotch four, checkmate.

11:48.459 --> 11:51.087
Easy-peasy, oh, so breezy.

12:01.722 --> 12:02.848
Hey, what's up?

12:03.057 --> 12:04.141
I'm here to put the crib together.

12:04.308 --> 12:06.143
Oh, sorry, I already did it.

12:07.103 --> 12:09.980
Oh, I don't know if you realize this,
but I bought that crib.

12:10.189 --> 12:14.235
Oh, yeah, I read about that
on WhoGivesACrap.com.

12:16.195 --> 12:18.114
Why are you being like this?

12:18.823 --> 12:20.658
Because I love Howard and Bernadette,

12:20.825 --> 12:23.494
and if I want to keep mooching off them,
I need to be helpful.

12:24.203 --> 12:26.997
Hey, this pregnancy had
an emotionally-needy third wheel

12:27.206 --> 12:28.791
way before you came along.

12:30.751 --> 12:32.503
Why can't there be four wheels?

12:33.295 --> 12:36.465
Is this what you do when I'm not here,
make really good points?

12:37.341 --> 12:40.928
Well, look, just come in
and help me build a baby swing.

12:41.095 --> 12:42.179
Thank you.

12:43.013 --> 12:46.016
If you're hungry you can eat your takeout.
Nobody touched it.

12:48.853 --> 12:50.604
I think I'm gonna go for a run.
You want to come?

12:50.771 --> 12:53.941
No, last time that old lady in the park
kept screaming,

12:54.108 --> 12:55.776
"Watch out, he's right behind you."

13:00.906 --> 13:03.909
- Hello?
- Hey, how you doin'?

13:06.203 --> 13:08.289
Uh... Can I help you?

13:08.456 --> 13:11.041
I don't think so,
but you're sweet for asking.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.670
What are you doing in our apartment?

13:14.879 --> 13:17.590
Oh, I rented a room from your neighbor.

13:18.299 --> 13:21.552
Tall guy, dressed like a little boy?

13:23.762 --> 13:28.309
Unbelievable. Okay, uh, I don't know what
he told you, but you can't stay here.

13:28.601 --> 13:32.146
So, there are fresh linens
on the bed... Oh!

13:32.480 --> 13:34.732
Well, I see you've met Theodore.

13:36.192 --> 13:40.070
Theodore, these are your new roommates,
Leonard and Penny.

13:40.237 --> 13:43.157
They're very honest,
but I would not leave cash lying around.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.535
Sheldon, what do you think you're doing?

13:46.702 --> 13:48.662
My room is paid up
until the end of the month,

13:48.913 --> 13:50.789
so I can do with it whatever I please,

13:51.040 --> 13:53.667
which includes renting it out
for a dollar a night.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.794
It's like the '40s again.

13:59.381 --> 14:02.593
Anyway, I'll leave you be. I have to...
Oh, oh!

14:02.927 --> 14:05.012
He's expecting a newspaper in the morning.

14:05.221 --> 14:07.223
Yeah, apparently, they still make them.

14:07.932 --> 14:09.934
All right, Sheldon, this is over the line.

14:10.142 --> 14:13.020
Yeah, that's true, but had I done
something under the line,

14:13.187 --> 14:16.440
there wouldn't be a man in your kitchen
who can't produce a single form of ID.

14:16.649 --> 14:18.609
I have a receipt from a blood bank.

14:19.610 --> 14:21.487
I'm O negative.

14:25.449 --> 14:27.868
And now you know as much about him
as I do.

14:31.580 --> 14:36.126
Oh, hey, Bernadette, the swing comes
with two different mobiles.

14:36.335 --> 14:38.963
The giraffes are pretty cute,
what do you think?

14:39.296 --> 14:40.923
Great, go with the giraffes.

14:41.131 --> 14:43.634
Although the high contrast
of zebra stripes

14:43.801 --> 14:46.470
might provide better stimulus
for a developing baby.

14:48.472 --> 14:50.808
Yeah, you're probably right,
go with the zebras.

14:51.141 --> 14:52.434
Good choice, boss.

14:55.521 --> 14:57.439
At least my nose is naturally brown.

15:01.819 --> 15:03.862
Hey, could you please
go to the market for me?

15:04.446 --> 15:06.156
Get Stuart or Raj to do it.

15:06.490 --> 15:08.867
Howie, they've been doing
everything for you.

15:09.076 --> 15:12.121
Hmm, I know. It's really making me
lose respect for both of them.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.499
Please just go to the store.

15:16.208 --> 15:17.209
Fine.

15:18.669 --> 15:20.462
Who wants to drive me to the store?

15:20.671 --> 15:21.839
<i>- Me!
- I'll do it!</i>

15:22.423 --> 15:24.758
Take Raj.
Stuart is supposed to paint my toenails.

15:37.688 --> 15:39.523
What do you think?
Should we go to a hotel?

15:39.690 --> 15:41.358
And just leave him here alone?

15:41.567 --> 15:45.821
Okay, I'll go to a hotel. Text me
in the morning if you're still alive.

15:48.490 --> 15:52.786
Theodore, how long are you planning
to stay exactly?

15:52.953 --> 15:57.291
Thanks to the coins I found in your couch,
day longer than I thought.

15:58.626 --> 16:00.419
This is ridiculous.

16:03.297 --> 16:07.134
I like the painting. Is that your mom?

16:12.181 --> 16:14.266
Sheldon, get out here!

16:15.559 --> 16:17.061
Will you keep it down?

16:17.269 --> 16:20.397
What kind of vengeful bed and breakfast
do you think I'm running?

16:21.273 --> 16:24.818
We lived together 13 years.
How can you be so awful to me?

16:24.985 --> 16:28.197
I'm being awful? You're the one who
went out of your way to hurt me.

16:28.364 --> 16:29.740
Because you were being selfish.

16:29.948 --> 16:31.950
Dividing our belongings is difficult.

16:32.159 --> 16:33.994
Why? I said I didn't care!

16:34.203 --> 16:35.496
Excuse me.

16:35.746 --> 16:36.997
It's none of my business,

16:37.164 --> 16:41.085
but it sounds like a lot of this anger
is coming from love.

16:44.463 --> 16:46.757
Thanks, but nobody asked you.

16:47.007 --> 16:49.426
Well, I'm just gonna keep on talking.

16:51.261 --> 16:57.101
Seems like, with Sheldon moving out,
you're in a new phase of your lives,

16:57.851 --> 17:03.190
and it's easier to fight than to face the
feelings that you have for one another.

17:06.485 --> 17:08.112
I think he might be right.

17:08.445 --> 17:09.905
Also, who is that?

17:12.574 --> 17:13.951
I have to admit,

17:14.326 --> 17:18.288
leaving you to move in with Amy has been
harder than I thought it would be.

17:18.664 --> 17:21.458
For me, too.
It's not the same with you gone.

17:21.625 --> 17:23.544
If you're looking for a new guy
to live with...

17:23.711 --> 17:25.087
- No!
- We're okay. Thank you.

17:27.131 --> 17:28.966
So, no one's gonna tell me? Okay.

17:30.175 --> 17:33.345
Leonard, I would like us to stop fighting
about our possessions.

17:33.804 --> 17:35.180
Well, I'd like that, too.

17:35.389 --> 17:38.475
In fact, I want you to keep
the apartment flag,

17:38.809 --> 17:40.978
and I'm not just saying that
because it touched your genitals.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.356
- Promise?
- I do.

17:44.565 --> 17:46.608
And to show you
that there are no hard feelings,

17:46.817 --> 17:50.112
I am willing to rub my genitals
on it as well.

17:50.988 --> 17:55.617
Well, if we're rubbing genitals on things,
that's where I shine.

18:03.625 --> 18:05.085
Little lower to the left.

18:06.837 --> 18:08.297
A little more.

18:09.465 --> 18:10.674
Good?

18:10.841 --> 18:12.676
No, still hideous.

18:17.598 --> 18:20.684
Well, I'm sure at some point,
we won't even notice it's there.

18:20.893 --> 18:24.605
Yeah, you'd think that, but after a while
it starts showing up in your dreams.

18:26.398 --> 18:28.692
I think it brings the room together.

18:31.528 --> 18:33.489
Hey, tomorrow, who wants to paint
the nursery?

18:33.697 --> 18:34.698
I'll do it.

18:34.907 --> 18:36.366
Why do you get to do it? I'm the artist.

18:36.533 --> 18:38.869
Just because you're starving,
doesn't make you an artist.

18:40.579 --> 18:42.706
Just because I look sickly,
doesn't mean I'm starving.

18:44.208 --> 18:45.709
<i>Howard!</i>

18:46.835 --> 18:48.337
Guys, you heard her,
go see what she wants.

18:51.048 --> 18:52.466
I think I'm in labor.

18:52.674 --> 18:57.012
Whoa, whoa, okay.
Okay, uh, I can do this. We have a plan.

18:57.888 --> 18:59.556
Somebody please tell me the plan.

19:00.265 --> 19:01.892
- I'll get the hospital bag.
- I'll pull the van up.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.102
- Meet you outside in two minutes.
- Team Baby, go!

19:07.856 --> 19:10.400
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

19:11.693 --> 19:14.071
Are we hugging or having a baby? Let's go!

19:44.560 --> 19:45.561
English - SDH
