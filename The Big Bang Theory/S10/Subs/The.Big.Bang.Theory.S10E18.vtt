00:04.172 --> 00:06.091
Aw, man, did you see this post from Raj?

00:06.591 --> 00:08.802
What? Is it another video of him
and his dog

00:08.968 --> 00:11.096
<i>Lady-and-the-Tramping</i> some spaghetti?

00:12.764 --> 00:14.265
No, he can't afford his apartment,

00:14.432 --> 00:16.976
and he's asking if anyone knows
of a cheap place to live.

00:17.268 --> 00:20.146
I wanna say India,
but it seems mean.

00:23.942 --> 00:24.943
What's so funny?

00:25.318 --> 00:28.613
Raj is looking for a cheap place to live,
and I wrote "India."

00:31.282 --> 00:33.284
Don't post that, be supportive.

00:33.451 --> 00:36.705
Maybe you should be supportive
of my hilarious jokes.

00:38.456 --> 00:40.583
Fine, what should we do?

00:40.792 --> 00:42.711
We're smart,
I'm sure we can think of something.

00:43.169 --> 00:44.546
You wanna let him live here?

00:44.963 --> 00:46.423
Oh, we're smarter than that.

00:48.466 --> 00:52.137
I know our apartment's small,
but I think we can make room.

00:52.303 --> 00:53.430
No, Sheldon!

00:53.722 --> 00:55.974
We are not getting a
life-size Spider-Man statue.

00:59.060 --> 01:00.854
We do have Sheldon's old room.

01:01.104 --> 01:03.815
If he really needs a place to stay,
I guess we should offer it to him.

01:04.482 --> 01:05.483
You're a good friend.

01:06.526 --> 01:08.403
Am I still a good friend
if I wait and hope

01:08.570 --> 01:10.613
that Howard offers him
a place to live first?

01:11.448 --> 01:13.032
You're an even better husband.

01:15.368 --> 01:18.538
I know if the roles were reversed,
he would do it for me.

01:19.456 --> 01:21.624
Where would he stay?
We already have Stuart.

01:22.167 --> 01:24.419
Well, we can make some space
in the garage,

01:24.586 --> 01:26.421
maybe put a cot out there,

01:26.588 --> 01:29.340
get him a space heater, maybe a hot plate.

01:29.507 --> 01:30.508
That sounds awful.

01:30.675 --> 01:32.093
Let's hope he thinks so too.

01:33.762 --> 01:39.100
For the last time, no Hulk,
no Batman, no life-size statues.

01:39.684 --> 01:40.852
Wow.

01:41.019 --> 01:43.271
I'm starting to think you didn't mean it
when you said you wanted to

01:43.480 --> 01:44.522
spruce up the place.

02:16.721 --> 02:18.223
- Hello?
- Hey.

02:18.515 --> 02:22.769
Uh, so, we've been talking,
and if you need a place to stay,

02:22.936 --> 02:25.396
we'd be happy to fix up the garage
for you.

02:25.855 --> 02:27.565
That would be amazing!

02:27.732 --> 02:29.651
I was literally just looking at
my moving boxes,

02:29.818 --> 02:31.569
trying to pick one to live in.

02:33.196 --> 02:34.239
I know it's not ideal,

02:34.405 --> 02:36.407
but you'd have plenty of space
for your furniture,

02:36.574 --> 02:40.286
and there's this cool button that makes
an entire wall go up and down.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.456
I cannot thank you enough.

02:43.623 --> 02:45.416
<i>It is our pleasure.</i>

02:45.583 --> 02:48.169
Hey. Can you hold on one sec? Hello?

02:48.628 --> 02:50.880
Hey, buddy,
you still looking for a place to live?

02:51.089 --> 02:54.425
Uh, yeah, why do you ask?

02:55.051 --> 02:58.012
You know, we have the extra bedroom,
and if you need it, it's yours.

02:58.471 --> 03:00.598
Oh, my God, that's so generous!

03:00.890 --> 03:01.891
It's the least we can do.

03:02.058 --> 03:05.770
Why, I really appreciate it.
Can you hold on one second?

03:07.480 --> 03:10.483
Hey. So, Howard,
what's the bathroom situation gonna be?

03:11.776 --> 03:16.197
Well, there's a sink out there,
that takes care of half your problems.

03:17.532 --> 03:19.450
But I can use
the downstairs bathroom, right?

03:19.951 --> 03:23.371
Yeah, we barely use it,
so, it'll be like it's yours.

03:23.580 --> 03:25.540
Cool, cool.
Yeah, yeah, hold on one second.

03:25.707 --> 03:26.749
Well, I...

03:27.542 --> 03:30.169
Hey. What's it like
sharing a bathroom with Penny?

03:30.336 --> 03:33.548
Is there hair everywhere?
Does she use your loofah?

03:34.924 --> 03:35.925
I don't have a loofah.

03:36.092 --> 03:38.469
Okay, well, if I move in,
you can't use mine. Hold on a second.

03:40.805 --> 03:44.100
Hey. Howard,
how's the Wi-Fi in the garage?

03:45.143 --> 03:47.979
I don't know...
Why are you asking all these questions?

03:48.438 --> 03:50.356
Well, to be honest,
Leonard's on the other line,

03:50.523 --> 03:52.317
and he offered me their spare bedroom.

03:52.817 --> 03:54.319
Great, go live there.

03:54.694 --> 03:56.821
But you made the garage sound so fun.

03:57.655 --> 03:59.449
Yeah, I just didn't want you to
feel bad about it.

03:59.616 --> 04:01.200
Unless Leonard's apartment
also has a raccoon

04:01.367 --> 04:03.786
that chews its way in
on cold nights, go there.

04:05.747 --> 04:06.998
One second.

04:07.165 --> 04:08.791
Okay, I think we're close.

04:09.626 --> 04:12.462
How do you feel about
a mini-fridge in my room?

04:12.837 --> 04:14.464
Hey. Pal, you wanna live here or not?

04:14.672 --> 04:16.424
Oh. Uh, hi, Penny. Yes, please.

04:19.344 --> 04:20.345
- Hey.
- Hi.

04:20.511 --> 04:23.473
Hi. Penny, this circular
is addressed to "occupant,"

04:23.640 --> 04:27.018
but with our apartment switch,
it's unclear whether it's yours or mine.

04:27.185 --> 04:28.853
- What's it for?
- Uh, roofing.

04:29.020 --> 04:30.229
Yeah, it's yours.

04:31.814 --> 04:33.024
Okay, thanks.

04:33.608 --> 04:34.901
"Just throw it out."

04:37.028 --> 04:38.696
Speaking of occupants,

04:38.863 --> 04:42.158
I'm given to understand Raj will be
moving into my old room.

04:42.325 --> 04:43.618
Yeah, for a little while.

04:43.785 --> 04:44.786
What about his dog?

04:44.953 --> 04:47.080
Uh, she'll be in her crate,
it's not a big deal.

04:47.246 --> 04:48.748
I suppose that's acceptable.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.541
Well, Sheldon's getting
a little better with dogs.

04:50.750 --> 04:52.961
He even took a picture with Pluto
at Disneyland.

04:54.545 --> 04:57.215
If real dogs gave me buttons,
I'd like them too.

04:59.175 --> 05:02.553
Well, I think it's very nice
that you're helping out our friend.

05:02.720 --> 05:03.930
I think it's nice that you're taking

05:04.097 --> 05:06.766
whatever medication
Amy's clearly giving you.

05:09.227 --> 05:10.395
Now, what is that supposed to mean?

05:10.561 --> 05:12.438
Well, it's like that science thing.

05:12.605 --> 05:16.025
For every action,
you have a gigantic and annoying reaction.

05:18.361 --> 05:20.530
Just when I thought
you couldn't get any hotter.

05:20.738 --> 05:21.739
Mmm-hmm.

05:22.448 --> 05:23.574
If you're implying

05:23.741 --> 05:27.078
that I'd have some problem with him
moving into my room, you're wrong.

05:27.245 --> 05:29.789
Now, Raj is in
a difficult financial situation,

05:29.956 --> 05:32.125
and I'm glad he's making changes
to improve it.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.210
Do not adjust the dosage, you nailed it.

05:37.922 --> 05:39.215
Don't listen to them.

05:39.674 --> 05:42.593
What's weird is that Penny
almost got a science fact right.

05:44.095 --> 05:46.514
I mean, it's unfair.
People just assume I'm going to be upset

05:46.681 --> 05:48.391
by Raj moving into my old room.

05:49.017 --> 05:50.309
But, you are, aren't you?

05:50.601 --> 05:51.602
Oh, I'm outraged.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.064
Talk to me, tell me what's going on?

05:55.440 --> 05:58.776
Well, that's been my room
since before I met Leonard,

05:58.985 --> 06:01.029
and now, someone else
is going to be living in it.

06:01.195 --> 06:03.114
And that someone else is not me,

06:03.281 --> 06:05.033
and you know how I feel about people
who aren't me.

06:07.577 --> 06:10.079
There are a lot of memories wrapped up
in that room.

06:10.246 --> 06:11.456
For me, too.

06:11.998 --> 06:14.125
First time you told me you loved me
was in that room.

06:14.292 --> 06:17.628
Wrong, we were standing outside my room
in the hallway.

06:18.463 --> 06:20.965
And there is the love of which I speak.

06:21.632 --> 06:22.925
I realize it's irrational,

06:23.092 --> 06:26.387
but with Raj moving in there,
I'm feeling a bit replaced.

06:27.305 --> 06:29.265
Well, this isn't an easy time for him.

06:30.141 --> 06:34.520
He's losing his apartment, he's in debt,
he's probably humiliated.

06:34.729 --> 06:36.606
Yes, "probably,"

06:36.773 --> 06:39.692
but until we know for sure,
how can I feel better?

06:41.819 --> 06:43.488
Can I get anyone anything at all?

06:43.654 --> 06:44.989
Raj, you don't have to serve us.

06:45.156 --> 06:47.825
It's the least I can do
for helping me carry my stuff up.

06:48.242 --> 06:49.827
Well, it was really no problem.

06:50.203 --> 06:52.413
Not for you, box of towels.

06:54.791 --> 06:55.833
Anyway, thanks again.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.003
Hey. Look at that.
You got a Raj, we got a Stuart,

06:59.170 --> 07:03.007
maybe we should take 'em both to the park,
let 'em run around together.

07:04.842 --> 07:06.761
I don't know,
yours looks like he has worms.

07:09.305 --> 07:11.140
- You ready to go?
- All set.

07:11.682 --> 07:15.019
- What's that?
- A housewarming gift for Raj.

07:15.812 --> 07:17.897
Well, a bunch of fake snakes
better not spring out of it,

07:18.064 --> 07:20.358
'cause that was a lousy
anniversary present.

07:21.651 --> 07:23.152
It's nothing like that.

07:23.319 --> 07:27.073
I just... I thought about Raj's situation,
and I had a change of heart.

07:27.240 --> 07:31.244
And regarding your gift, you said,
"Surprise me," and boy, did I.

07:34.247 --> 07:35.373
- Hello.
- Hi.

07:35.540 --> 07:36.624
Perfect timing. Food's ready.

07:36.791 --> 07:37.917
Yeah, wait. Before we eat,

07:38.084 --> 07:40.795
I have a little
welcome-to-the-building gift for Raj.

07:41.087 --> 07:43.381
- Wait, is anything gonna jump out of that?
- No, I already asked.

07:45.258 --> 07:46.509
Thank you, Sheldon.

07:48.052 --> 07:49.887
It's a blank notebook.

07:50.513 --> 07:54.225
I had some of my best ideas in that room,
and I'm sure you will too.

07:54.392 --> 07:57.562
You also never had sex in that room,
that's something else to look forward to.

08:00.898 --> 08:01.899
This means a lot.

08:02.066 --> 08:03.943
Well, I know
this is a difficult time for you.

08:04.110 --> 08:06.404
You're losing your apartment,
you're in debt,

08:06.571 --> 08:08.406
and you just... You must be humiliated.

08:08.698 --> 08:09.782
- Sheldon.
- Do I...

08:09.949 --> 08:14.162
Good grief, she is such a stickler for
citing sources, those were Amy's words.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.665
- Sheldon...
- I know, I know!

08:17.832 --> 08:20.334
"Good grief" was originally said
by Charlie Brown, geez.

08:22.420 --> 08:24.088
You're right, I am humiliated.

08:24.255 --> 08:26.507
Thanks for pointing it out,
you're such a jerk.

08:27.592 --> 08:28.759
Could you believe this guy?

08:28.968 --> 08:30.261
- Yeah.
- Yes.

08:31.846 --> 08:34.599
I thought that was gonna break
the other way.

08:34.765 --> 08:36.976
Come on, Sheldon,
maybe we should just eat at our place.

08:37.310 --> 08:38.394
Fine.

08:38.769 --> 08:39.937
Wait, you took my room,

08:40.188 --> 08:42.607
you turned my friends against me,
I hope you're happy.

08:42.815 --> 08:45.067
What do I have to be happy about?
My life's a wreck.

08:45.943 --> 08:47.069
How come he can say it and I can't?

08:47.236 --> 08:48.321
Just keep walking.

08:56.370 --> 09:00.291
<i>Hello, Sheldon, what a pleasant surprise.
How are you?</i>

09:01.125 --> 09:02.835
Honestly, I've been better.

09:03.002 --> 09:06.130
Do you have time?
Leonard says you're very busy these days.

09:06.505 --> 09:08.466
<i>Oh, I just say that because he prattles.</i>

09:10.885 --> 09:11.886
<i>What's going on?</i>

09:12.178 --> 09:15.806
Well, our friend Raj moved
into my old room,

09:15.973 --> 09:19.393
and it's brought up
a lot of negative feelings for me.

09:19.602 --> 09:23.356
<i>Hmm. What do you think
the loss of your room represents?</i>

09:23.648 --> 09:25.942
Beverly, you know
I hold you in high esteem,

09:26.108 --> 09:28.277
can we skip the part where you pretend
not to know the answer,

09:28.444 --> 09:30.488
and get to the part
where you tell me the answer?

09:32.323 --> 09:36.327
<i>Very well, but if you don't mind,
I'd still like to pause for effect.</i>

09:37.912 --> 09:39.038
<i>Now...</i>

09:40.957 --> 09:44.543
<i>You've recently moved in
with Dr. Fowler, yes?</i>

09:44.710 --> 09:45.920
I have.

09:46.254 --> 09:49.548
<i>But clearly, your old room represents
an escape hatch,</i>

09:49.715 --> 09:51.676
<i>and without it, you're forced to confront</i>

09:51.842 --> 09:56.847
<i>the terrifying reality of being trapped
in a relationship with Amy forever.</i>

09:58.724 --> 09:59.892
I hadn't thought about that.

10:00.059 --> 10:02.144
And don't start thinking about it now!

10:04.522 --> 10:05.564
<i>Hello, Amy.</i>

10:06.023 --> 10:08.901
<i>Your defensiveness may indicate
similar insecurities</i>

10:09.068 --> 10:10.903
<i>about your relationship with Sheldon.</i>

10:11.195 --> 10:12.196
That's not true!

10:12.488 --> 10:13.864
<i>She said defensively.</i>

10:16.701 --> 10:18.077
This isn't about me and Sheldon,

10:18.244 --> 10:21.247
this is about Rajesh moving in
with Leonard and Penny.

10:21.706 --> 10:23.416
<i>Interesting.</i>

10:23.708 --> 10:27.253
<i>They've found a need to take
yet another roommate.</i>

10:27.920 --> 10:30.881
<i>It seems they're avoiding
some harsh realities themselves.</i>

10:32.008 --> 10:35.720
I had no idea all our relationships
were such a disaster.

10:36.012 --> 10:37.013
Boy, you're good.

10:37.305 --> 10:38.973
<i>That is the word on the street, dear.</i>

10:42.768 --> 10:45.062
Maybe moving in was a bad idea.

10:45.229 --> 10:47.231
I haven't been here one day,
I'm already causing problems.

10:47.398 --> 10:49.734
No, you didn't do anything, it's Sheldon.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.068
"You didn't do anything, it's Sheldon,"

10:51.235 --> 10:53.571
that would make a nice needlepoint pillow.

10:55.281 --> 10:57.241
Relax, we're happy to have you.

10:57.616 --> 11:00.077
Thank you, but how do I know
you're not saying that just to be nice?

11:00.578 --> 11:01.746
Do you actually pay for that haircut?

11:01.912 --> 11:03.164
That'll do it.

11:05.249 --> 11:08.085
Hey, Raj, I owe you an apology.

11:08.502 --> 11:10.421
Could you please
put your dog on a leash?

11:10.921 --> 11:12.798
Sheldon, she's fine.

11:13.299 --> 11:15.468
Well, then at least hold her still,
so I can pretend she's stuffed.

11:17.178 --> 11:22.433
Raj, I let my emotions get the best of me,
and I unfairly took it out on you.

11:22.975 --> 11:24.268
Thank you. I appreciate that.

11:24.602 --> 11:25.686
Oh, I can't take all the credit.

11:25.853 --> 11:28.522
I spoke with Leonard's mother,
and she made me feel better.

11:28.773 --> 11:31.567
I don't know who you talked to,
but that wasn't my mother.

11:34.528 --> 11:39.283
Beverly pointed out that I'm experiencing
insecurities in my relationship with Amy,

11:39.450 --> 11:42.036
in the same way that Leonard and Penny
are in their relationship.

11:43.662 --> 11:45.456
What are you talking about? We're fine.

11:46.040 --> 11:48.542
Yes, you're fine as long as
you have a buffer living with you

11:48.709 --> 11:50.294
to distract from your marital problems.

11:50.628 --> 11:54.131
It used to be me,
now it's Raj and his attack tribble.

11:56.967 --> 11:58.803
Anyway, I'm sorry for everything.

11:59.220 --> 12:01.597
Oh. And FYI, if you cry
while they're fighting,

12:01.764 --> 12:02.848
they'll take you to McDonald's.

12:10.481 --> 12:11.482
<i>Hello, Leonard.</i>

12:11.982 --> 12:14.026
Why are you saying
we have marital problems?

12:14.193 --> 12:15.820
We don't have marital problems.

12:16.320 --> 12:19.448
<i>I see, you must be yelling at me
out of wedded bliss.</i>

12:23.035 --> 12:24.829
Look, just because we took our friend in

12:24.995 --> 12:27.665
does not mean that Penny and I
are afraid to be alone.

12:27.873 --> 12:30.459
Yeah, this is a special circumstance.

12:30.626 --> 12:34.088
<i>Sheldon mentioned you tried to
get your brother to live with you as well.</i>

12:35.005 --> 12:38.259
Yeah, well, a circumstance can happen
twice and still be special.

12:40.428 --> 12:41.429
<i>Do you agree with that?</i>

12:42.138 --> 12:43.514
Well, now that you point it out...

12:43.681 --> 12:45.433
Are you kidding me?

12:45.683 --> 12:47.685
We do seem to keep finding roommates.

12:47.852 --> 12:49.520
Now you're taking her side?

12:49.687 --> 12:52.773
<i>Dear, I would never come between
you and Leonard.</i>

12:52.940 --> 12:55.609
<i>That's for your parade of roommates to do.</i>

12:59.697 --> 13:00.823
<i>Howard.</i>

13:02.992 --> 13:03.993
<i>Howard.</i>

13:05.786 --> 13:08.205
It's me. It's just me.

13:08.372 --> 13:10.458
What are you doing here?

13:10.875 --> 13:13.294
Well, I texted you,
but you didn't respond,

13:13.461 --> 13:15.004
and Leonard and Penny were arguing...

13:15.171 --> 13:16.255
Not on my watch!

13:19.258 --> 13:20.843
It's fine, it's just Raj.

13:21.010 --> 13:22.970
You can hit him with the bat,
but it's fine.

13:24.513 --> 13:26.223
And if my heart stops, just let me go.

13:27.391 --> 13:28.559
I'm sorry, guys.

13:28.726 --> 13:31.270
Sheldon was upset,
Leonard and Penny were fighting,

13:31.437 --> 13:34.398
I just wanted to go someplace
where I wasn't causing problems.

13:34.565 --> 13:36.150
I'll say it again,

13:36.859 --> 13:37.985
India.

13:42.198 --> 13:43.782
Can I just stay in the garage?

13:43.949 --> 13:45.743
Don't do that,
we'll make up the couch for you,

13:45.910 --> 13:47.286
and figure out something in the morning.

13:47.495 --> 13:49.163
- Thank you.
- Come on,

13:49.330 --> 13:50.789
I'll get you some sheets,
and then we'll see

13:50.956 --> 13:53.209
if I can beat my high score
on the blood pressure machine.

13:58.088 --> 14:00.633
Never should've had
all these kids so close together.

14:12.603 --> 14:13.604
Are you okay?

14:14.688 --> 14:15.856
I can't sleep.

14:17.483 --> 14:18.484
What's wrong?

14:19.693 --> 14:24.406
Beverly believes I unconsciously
consider my old room an escape hatch.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.450
Is that bothering you?

14:27.076 --> 14:29.954
Yes. I don't care for
unconscious thoughts.

14:30.162 --> 14:33.207
My brain and I are best friends,
it should tell me everything.

14:34.917 --> 14:37.211
I mean,
how it relates to our relationship,

14:37.378 --> 14:39.797
not the bromance between you
and your brain.

14:41.966 --> 14:43.551
Well, what if she's correct?

14:44.134 --> 14:46.053
Doesn't that say
something troubling about us?

14:47.137 --> 14:50.099
I don't know, I just think
you're the kind of person

14:50.266 --> 14:52.351
who likes a contingency plan.

14:54.019 --> 14:55.229
That is true.

14:56.021 --> 14:57.565
Did you know I figured out

14:57.731 --> 15:01.443
in which order I would eat all my friends
in the event of an apocalypse?

15:04.947 --> 15:06.824
You need to stop hanging out
with your brain so much,

15:06.991 --> 15:08.200
it's not a good influence.

15:12.746 --> 15:15.165
If you're looking for spare change,
I already cleaned it out.

15:18.419 --> 15:21.964
Well... Didn't think
this is where my life would be.

15:22.506 --> 15:25.426
Me, either.
I'm in a bedroom and you're on a couch,

15:25.593 --> 15:26.844
I'm actually winning.

15:28.846 --> 15:29.972
You know, we're both down on our luck,

15:30.139 --> 15:31.890
maybe you and I should try
to get a place together.

15:32.141 --> 15:34.101
Okay, listen to me.

15:36.562 --> 15:37.646
Okay.

15:38.606 --> 15:40.190
There is no reason to leave here.

15:40.357 --> 15:43.777
This is great.
Everyone's nice, it's comfortable.

15:43.944 --> 15:46.363
If all goes according to plan,
this is my retirement home.

15:47.698 --> 15:50.326
Wouldn't you feel better about yourself
if you were more independent?

15:50.701 --> 15:53.704
Better than I feel in their steam shower?
I don't think so.

15:56.498 --> 15:58.083
Penny would be the entree.

16:00.961 --> 16:03.297
Then Leonard's basically a cheese course.

16:04.298 --> 16:07.593
And then because I love you,
you're dessert.

16:09.011 --> 16:12.097
I wanna say, "Aw,"
but I'm gonna say, "Ew."

16:14.683 --> 16:17.728
Well, you see, I'm doing this
so I can stop being spoiled

16:17.895 --> 16:20.898
and, you know, grow as a person.

16:21.398 --> 16:22.483
Good for you.

16:22.650 --> 16:25.361
This sandwich has
six dollars' worth of ham in it.

16:28.864 --> 16:31.742
Don't you even feel a little bad
sponging off your friends?

16:32.701 --> 16:34.953
Hey, look, I went to art college,

16:35.120 --> 16:36.580
I tried to make it as a graphic artist,

16:37.331 --> 16:38.332
comic book artist,

16:38.499 --> 16:39.958
and you know what I got for my efforts?

16:40.125 --> 16:41.460
A visible rib cage.

16:43.671 --> 16:45.839
I'm not kidding,
you can see my heart beating.

16:47.216 --> 16:49.134
Well, no offense,
but I didn't go to art school.

16:49.301 --> 16:50.928
I have a PhD in astrophysics.

16:51.637 --> 16:52.930
Hmm. Great. Then it'll be easier for you

16:53.097 --> 16:55.557
to look up at the stars
without a roof over your head.

16:59.144 --> 17:00.145
Morning.

17:00.312 --> 17:02.439
Did you know Raj moved out last night?

17:02.606 --> 17:03.649
What? Why?

17:03.857 --> 17:06.318
"Leonard and Penny,
I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused.

17:06.485 --> 17:07.695
"I went to stay at Howard's.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.613
"P.S., Cinnamon's with me,

17:09.780 --> 17:11.365
"but if you feel like
messing with Sheldon,

17:11.532 --> 17:13.742
"tell him she's loose in the building."

17:16.704 --> 17:17.996
I feel terrible.

17:18.288 --> 17:19.289
Should we go bring him back?

17:19.456 --> 17:20.499
Well, you're the one worried

17:20.666 --> 17:22.751
having someone live with us
is a sign of problems.

17:23.502 --> 17:25.879
Well, that was just because
my mother got in my head.

17:26.046 --> 17:27.464
It's like being possessed,

17:27.631 --> 17:30.592
but instead of Satan, it's...
Actually, it's the same thing.

17:32.886 --> 17:35.139
All right,
so we'll ask him to come back.

17:35.597 --> 17:36.640
Great.

17:37.641 --> 17:38.892
Don't you wanna get dressed first?

17:39.059 --> 17:40.310
Just one second.

17:46.817 --> 17:49.653
Help, Cinnamon's loose in the building!

17:51.029 --> 17:53.073
<i>Amy, quick, lock the door!</i>

17:57.286 --> 17:59.455
We're so sorry
if we made you feel uncomfortable,

17:59.621 --> 18:00.914
we really weren't fighting about you.

18:01.290 --> 18:03.208
I just never want to be a burden
on my friends.

18:03.667 --> 18:04.960
Me, either, don't wanna be a burden.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.670
Is that the baby? I'll go check.

18:08.839 --> 18:10.007
You're not a burden,

18:10.174 --> 18:11.842
and we want you to come back
and stay with us.

18:12.176 --> 18:13.302
But I also upset Sheldon,

18:13.469 --> 18:15.679
and he's not gonna wanna come over
if I'm there.

18:15.971 --> 18:17.598
More reasons for you to stay.

18:20.642 --> 18:21.643
Halley's fine.

18:22.144 --> 18:24.021
You know
she's at my parents' house, right?

18:26.523 --> 18:29.026
And she's having the time of her life.

18:31.528 --> 18:34.573
If you ever wanna change things up,
you're always welcome here.

18:35.073 --> 18:37.034
Just not in our bedroom, you dumbass.

18:40.329 --> 18:42.039
I appreciate it,

18:42.206 --> 18:45.417
but I think staying with Leonard and Penny
makes more sense for everyone.

18:45.584 --> 18:46.627
Then it's settled.

18:46.794 --> 18:50.047
And just so you know, it's only temporary,
I'm not gonna get too comfortable.

18:50.631 --> 18:54.218
Good, nobody needs a mooch
living in their house forever.

18:54.384 --> 18:56.386
Hey, that's no way
to talk about your baby.

19:05.604 --> 19:07.856
You know what, I'm proud of us.

19:08.023 --> 19:10.526
You know, with Penny
and Leonard taking in Raj,

19:10.692 --> 19:12.820
and Stuart living with Howard
and Bernadette,

19:12.986 --> 19:15.072
we're the only couple of our social group

19:15.239 --> 19:18.617
who doesn't need to fill the holes
in their relationship with a third party.

19:19.493 --> 19:20.494
Yeah, we're killing it.

19:52.401 --> 19:53.402
English - SDH
