WEBVTT

00:05.048 --> 00:06.257
Go!

00:06.549 --> 00:07.801
- Come on, Raj!
<i>- You can do this!</i>

00:07.967 --> 00:09.761
- There's no way.
- What is happening?

00:10.053 --> 00:11.262
Okay, this is an Euler's Disk.

00:11.429 --> 00:12.722
It's a physics toy that demonstrates

00:12.889 --> 00:15.725
angular momentum, potential energy
and kinetic energy.

00:15.934 --> 00:17.769
Oh, look at you watching sports.

00:19.229 --> 00:20.355
We're betting to see if Koothrappali

00:20.522 --> 00:22.440
can hold his breath
longer than the disk can spin.

00:22.607 --> 00:23.942
Yeah, its weight and smoothness,

00:24.109 --> 00:25.777
along with the slight concavity
of the mirror

00:25.944 --> 00:27.278
means it can spin for a long time.

00:27.445 --> 00:29.531
But Raj is from India, well, which means

00:29.698 --> 00:31.282
he's no slouch at holding his breath.

00:33.034 --> 00:37.288
Okay, I want in. Ten bucks says I'll lose
interest before that thing stops spinning.

00:38.832 --> 00:40.500
Hey, Sheldon, I found
a great restaurant for date night.

00:40.667 --> 00:41.960
Kind of busy right now.

00:42.669 --> 00:44.337
Oh, an Euler's Disk, fun.

00:44.504 --> 00:46.506
Now we're seeing if Raj
can hold his breath longer than it.

00:46.923 --> 00:48.299
Oh, immature.

00:50.051 --> 00:51.511
How you doing?

00:51.928 --> 00:53.012
He's not gonna make it!

00:53.346 --> 00:54.472
Yes, he is!

00:54.639 --> 00:56.516
You know, deep sea divers
holding their breath

00:56.683 --> 00:59.394
for several minutes have shown
elevated markers of a protein

00:59.561 --> 01:01.146
that can signal brain damage.

01:01.312 --> 01:03.982
Yeah, see, what's happening here
signals brain damage.

01:06.067 --> 01:07.777
Oh, my God,
how long does this thing spin for?

01:07.944 --> 01:10.780
Ah! You're interested,
you're out 10 bucks!

01:11.156 --> 01:12.741
It's slowing down!

01:12.907 --> 01:15.660
Dig deep! Like when they bet
you couldn't fit into Howard's pants!

01:18.121 --> 01:19.998
- He's not gonna make it!
- Yes, he is!

01:20.248 --> 01:22.625
Come on, Raj!
It's like your favorite movie,

01:22.792 --> 01:24.669
you're just waiting to exhale!

01:29.257 --> 01:31.384
- Yeah!
- I knew you could do it!

01:32.927 --> 01:35.013
And just so you know,

01:35.180 --> 01:38.349
my favorite movie is <i>Princess Bride.</i>

02:09.589 --> 02:11.716
<i>Hello, Rajesh, how are things by you?</i>

02:11.883 --> 02:13.009
Good, good.

02:13.384 --> 02:14.719
Uh, listen, I just wanted to let you know

02:15.053 --> 02:16.054
when you get my credit card bill,

02:16.262 --> 02:17.972
it might be a little high this month.

02:18.139 --> 02:20.642
<i>Well, you're a grown man
with a steadyjob,</i>

02:20.809 --> 02:24.103
<i>why wouldn't you spend
all your father's money.</i>

02:24.771 --> 02:28.358
Oh, Daddy,
you're so rich and funny.

02:29.234 --> 02:31.569
<i>Yeah, so what else is
going on with your life?</i>

02:31.736 --> 02:36.074
Uh, well, I was dating a woman at
the university but we broke up.

02:36.241 --> 02:37.575
<i>I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

02:37.742 --> 02:40.954
I know you are.
That's why you just bought me a new iPad.

02:42.705 --> 02:46.918
And before you start, I am not interested
in you arranging a marriage for me.

02:47.085 --> 02:49.170
<i>Oh, I gave up on that a long time ago.</i>

02:49.337 --> 02:50.380
You did?

02:50.672 --> 02:51.840
<i>It's too much work.</i>

02:52.006 --> 02:55.468
<i>You're an adult who can't get by
without an allowance from his parents.</i>

02:55.635 --> 02:57.053
<i>Women don't want that.</i>

02:57.220 --> 03:00.390
What are you saying,
that you're giving up on me?

03:00.557 --> 03:02.267
What kind of father gives up on his son?

03:02.433 --> 03:03.852
<i>I have six children,</i>

03:04.018 --> 03:06.354
<i>five of whom are married
and self-sufficient,</i>

03:06.521 --> 03:09.274
<i>I don't think I'm the problem.</i>

03:10.108 --> 03:13.945
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
This is deeply hurtful!

03:14.112 --> 03:18.032
<i>You're also too sensitive,
women don't want that, either.</i>

03:22.287 --> 03:24.789
The food here is supposed to be great.
Don't fill up on chips.

03:24.956 --> 03:26.416
Oh, I won't, I have a trick.

03:26.583 --> 03:28.793
I only eat equilateral triangles.

03:30.295 --> 03:32.922
Isosceles... Isosceles...

03:33.464 --> 03:35.341
Oh, scalene...

03:37.051 --> 03:39.554
You didn't see that.

03:41.598 --> 03:44.392
Oh, look, it's Bert at the bar.
We should go say hi.

03:45.560 --> 03:46.853
Why?

03:47.812 --> 03:51.691
Because that's what you do when you
see someone you know in a public place.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.653
I have multiple restraining orders
that say otherwise.

03:58.114 --> 04:00.658
Sheldon, there's a difference
between greeting a friend

04:00.825 --> 04:02.410
and following a celebrity into a bathroom.

04:04.495 --> 04:07.707
If the judge couldn't explain it to me,
I don't see how you will.

04:10.335 --> 04:11.920
- Hi, Bert.
- Hello.

04:12.086 --> 04:14.130
Oh, hey, guys, what brings you here?

04:14.422 --> 04:15.506
Oh, we're having date night.

04:15.673 --> 04:17.467
Nice, I'm meeting someone, too.

04:17.634 --> 04:19.260
Oh, really, anybody we know?

04:19.677 --> 04:22.430
I doubt it, I met her on G-Harmony.

04:22.597 --> 04:25.850
That's a website for geologists
to find love.

04:26.517 --> 04:27.602
That's a real thing?

04:27.810 --> 04:29.687
Yeah, their slogan is,

04:29.854 --> 04:32.815
"We're all about dating,
and not the Carbon-14 kind."

04:35.860 --> 04:37.195
Well, have a lovely evening.

04:37.362 --> 04:38.488
Thanks. You, too.

04:40.698 --> 04:42.533
If you think that's more fun
than talking to Zachary Quinto

04:42.700 --> 04:44.035
through a stall door, you're crazy.

04:47.288 --> 04:50.041
You know we could've come to you guys,
you didn't have to bring the baby here.

04:50.208 --> 04:51.626
It's okay,
it's good to get out of the house.

04:51.834 --> 04:53.211
And the car ride puts her to sleep.

04:53.503 --> 04:55.672
Aw... That used to work with Sheldon.

04:57.048 --> 04:59.968
Yeah, until someone left him in the
drug store parking lot and he freaked out.

05:00.134 --> 05:01.886
Who forgot to crack the window?

05:03.471 --> 05:05.056
- Hello.
<i>- Hey.</i>

05:05.223 --> 05:06.891
Someone's been shopping at Gucci.

05:07.058 --> 05:10.061
Yeah, I saw something for Halley
and I couldn't resist.

05:10.228 --> 05:11.562
That's so sweet of you.

05:11.729 --> 05:15.358
Yeah, it's a crushed velvet baby cape.

05:17.151 --> 05:19.904
Oh, no, now we have two.

05:21.155 --> 05:23.116
That must've been expensive.

05:23.282 --> 05:26.077
Yeah, it was, but it's my father's money
and I'm mad at him.

05:27.537 --> 05:29.956
- What's going on with your dad?
- And, if you really wanna hurt him,

05:30.123 --> 05:31.582
I look great in Chanel.

05:32.542 --> 05:34.919
It turns out he doesn't care
if I'm married, or if I'm single.

05:35.086 --> 05:36.921
He's basically given up on me.

05:37.672 --> 05:38.881
Aw, I'm sure that's not true.

05:39.090 --> 05:42.010
It is. He stopped trying to
find Indian girls for me to marry.

05:42.260 --> 05:44.262
But all you did was complain
when he did that.

05:44.429 --> 05:47.223
Wait, Leonard, he's hurting,
let him feel how he feels.

05:47.724 --> 05:48.933
Well, thank you, Penny.

05:49.100 --> 05:50.935
Yeah. Shoes, I'm a seven and a half,
boots I'm an eight.

05:54.605 --> 05:56.733
MSN Search,

05:56.899 --> 05:58.484
AltaVista,

05:58.651 --> 06:02.488
and Ask Jeeves. You?

06:03.072 --> 06:06.534
Sorry, I don't have a list of defunct
search engines that I miss.

06:08.703 --> 06:11.956
Hey, looks like I got stood up,
so, I'm gonna head out.

06:12.123 --> 06:14.667
Oh, no. Are you sure you don't wanna
give her a few more minutes?

06:15.043 --> 06:20.173
Nah, G-Harmony recommends after two hours,
it's time to cut bait.

06:22.467 --> 06:23.551
I'm so sorry.

06:23.801 --> 06:26.804
Bert, I insist that you join us.

06:26.971 --> 06:28.222
You really wouldn't mind?

06:28.431 --> 06:29.640
Not at all. Amy?

06:30.058 --> 06:31.100
Fine with me.

06:31.267 --> 06:33.519
Thanks, I'll go grab a chair.

06:34.645 --> 06:36.814
Sheldon, that was so sweet of you.

06:37.315 --> 06:41.235
I could deduce by his facial expression
and body language that he was sad.

06:42.111 --> 06:45.573
So, the part where he got stood up
didn't clue you in?

06:46.324 --> 06:50.328
You want me to look at him
and listen to him?

06:51.829 --> 06:54.749
My father thinks the reason
I can't make a relationship work

06:54.916 --> 06:56.375
is because I'm spoiled.

07:02.006 --> 07:05.218
I'm sorry, is he waiting
for someone to disagree?

07:05.843 --> 07:07.428
Just because he helps me out,

07:07.595 --> 07:09.806
doesn't automatically
mean that I'm spoiled.

07:09.972 --> 07:11.349
All right, how much exactly
does he pay for?

07:13.851 --> 07:16.938
Okay, I'll tell you
but please don't judge me.

07:17.105 --> 07:20.316
He pays for my car,
my rent and my credit cards.

07:23.444 --> 07:25.530
I'm trying, but I'm judging.

07:27.865 --> 07:28.950
Maybe your dad's right.

07:29.117 --> 07:31.244
Yeah, women do like a man
that can support himself.

07:31.577 --> 07:33.454
But Bernadette makes
more money than Howard.

07:33.621 --> 07:36.332
She basically supports him.

07:36.624 --> 07:38.668
Yeah, maybe your dad's right.

07:42.380 --> 07:44.632
Good question, let's see,

07:45.049 --> 07:49.637
Infoseek, Webcrawler, oh, Hotbot.

07:50.888 --> 07:52.890
Okay, literally any other topic.

07:54.559 --> 07:57.061
All right, how did you guys meet?

07:57.228 --> 07:59.063
Actually, we met online.

07:59.230 --> 08:01.190
Our first date was at a coffee shop.

08:01.399 --> 08:05.361
Although, unlike your date,
she actually showed up.

08:05.903 --> 08:07.405
Oh, he looks sad again.

08:09.574 --> 08:12.076
Well, I really envy your relationship.

08:12.243 --> 08:14.245
Other than you two only
having sex once a year,

08:14.412 --> 08:16.497
you're the perfect couple.

08:19.041 --> 08:20.084
You know about that?

08:20.251 --> 08:23.129
Yeah, everyone at the university does.

08:24.172 --> 08:25.548
Were you aware of this?

08:25.715 --> 08:29.427
No! No, I only told Leonard, Howard, Raj,

08:29.594 --> 08:32.722
Kripke, Professor Woo, Professor Klein,

08:33.389 --> 08:36.017
and a lunch lady in the cafeteria.

08:36.184 --> 08:38.936
Wait, how everyone else found out
is a mystery to me.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.613
Why aren't you talking to me?

08:48.779 --> 08:50.031
Because I'm mad at you.

08:50.489 --> 08:52.658
Oh, well, now I'm sorry I asked.

08:53.910 --> 08:55.578
Sheldon, it's humiliating!

08:55.953 --> 08:58.831
Thanks to you, my colleagues
are gossiping about our sex life.

08:58.998 --> 09:02.543
Well, what is there to gossip about?
We barely have one!

09:04.337 --> 09:05.963
That's why they're doing it!

09:10.051 --> 09:13.012
Is it safe to assume
you're not speaking to me again?

09:15.056 --> 09:17.391
If you're not answering because
you're not speaking to me,

09:17.558 --> 09:20.519
perhaps we could come up with a signal!

09:24.482 --> 09:25.566
That works!

09:28.444 --> 09:29.904
You don't need your dad's money.

09:30.071 --> 09:31.739
You can get by on your salary.

09:31.906 --> 09:34.158
Yeah, well, we worked
at the same place as you

09:34.325 --> 09:35.743
and we've always been fine.

09:35.910 --> 09:37.203
Oh, please, look in the mirror,

09:37.370 --> 09:38.913
you both look 10 years older than I do.

09:41.457 --> 09:43.000
All right, hang on,
we can figure this out.

09:43.167 --> 09:45.628
Let's just go over your expenses.
How much is your rent?

09:46.087 --> 09:47.505
I don't want to say.

09:48.547 --> 09:49.840
Is it really that high?

09:50.675 --> 09:53.010
I don't wanna say because
I don't know how much it is.

09:54.387 --> 09:55.388
You don't know how much your rent is?

09:55.554 --> 09:57.640
Well, my father pays for it!
Do you know how much your rent is?

09:57.807 --> 09:59.183
- Yeah!
- Well then, double it,

09:59.350 --> 10:01.435
because my building's
a lot nicer than this dump.

10:03.980 --> 10:06.440
- Do you know how much your car costs?
- Not really.

10:06.732 --> 10:08.859
Well, how much do you spend on food?

10:09.819 --> 10:11.696
The housekeeper does the shopping.

10:13.364 --> 10:15.533
Oh, my God, you really are spoiled.

10:15.783 --> 10:20.204
I'm spoiled?
Your baby has a cape that costs $300!

10:26.168 --> 10:27.169
I'm going to bed.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.880
Well, wait,

10:30.047 --> 10:32.508
this is our first fight as
a couple who live together.

10:32.717 --> 10:33.759
So?

10:34.343 --> 10:36.012
Well, I'm not sure of the protocol.

10:36.178 --> 10:38.889
Television teaches us that the man
is supposed to sleep on the couch.

10:39.056 --> 10:42.518
But, of the two of us,
you're clearly more sofa-sized.

10:43.311 --> 10:46.814
I'm not sleeping on the couch 'cause you
don't know what's private and what's not.

10:47.189 --> 10:48.733
This isn't fair.

10:49.108 --> 10:52.194
You've discussed aspects of our
physical relationship with Penny.

10:52.403 --> 10:53.612
That's different!

10:53.779 --> 10:56.198
She's a close friend,
not the lady in the cafeteria

10:56.365 --> 10:58.909
who cuts the crust off your sandwiches.

10:59.160 --> 11:00.911
That lady has a name.

11:01.078 --> 11:04.248
I don't know what it is, but one time
I accidentally called her mom.

11:08.044 --> 11:10.046
It sounds like you're gonna
need a cheaper place to live.

11:10.796 --> 11:13.382
When you moved here you didn't have
a lot of money, how'd you get by?

11:13.799 --> 11:18.262
Well, sometimes you can get free food
and Wi-Fi from the neighbors.

11:19.597 --> 11:22.683
Just know you might have to
marry one of them.

11:24.060 --> 11:26.645
Hey, you guys let Stuart
live with you, why not Raj, too?

11:27.188 --> 11:29.106
What are you doing? I...

11:31.108 --> 11:35.780
I schlepped the baby over, I brought
imported beer, why don't you like me?

11:36.947 --> 11:38.574
But I thought we were best friends!

11:38.741 --> 11:44.038
No, we are! That's why I'm sad
my best friend's gonna be homeless.

11:45.456 --> 11:47.833
I'm sorry, Raj.
We really just don't have the space.

11:48.084 --> 11:49.335
What if he lives in your garage?

11:49.585 --> 11:51.587
What if you stop helping?

11:53.506 --> 11:55.758
Guys, I'm not living in a garage.

11:56.175 --> 11:58.386
Wait, well why are we
talking about our place

11:58.552 --> 12:02.640
when Sheldon's old room is
sitting there perfectly empty?

12:04.058 --> 12:05.726
That's a great idea.

12:07.395 --> 12:11.482
Raj, if you need a place to stay,
of course you are welcome here.

12:12.733 --> 12:15.820
Thank you, but if I'm gonna just
take advantage of my friends,

12:15.986 --> 12:18.322
might as well keep on
relying on my father.

12:18.489 --> 12:19.782
Okay, only if you're sure.

12:21.033 --> 12:22.868
- Phew.
- Yeah.

12:26.038 --> 12:28.916
<i>Amy. Amy. Amy.</i>

12:29.083 --> 12:30.167
Yeah?

12:31.419 --> 12:34.004
Not exactly the welcome wagon,
but I'll take it.

12:36.674 --> 12:38.008
What is this?

12:38.509 --> 12:41.178
I'm mapping basic topics of conversation

12:41.345 --> 12:43.722
and with whom they can be discussed.

12:44.515 --> 12:47.935
Now, I call these circles
"Zones of Privacy."

12:48.102 --> 12:51.856
Don't Google that unless you want
to see pictures of people's genitals.

12:52.773 --> 12:55.484
This circle contains only me and you.

12:55.734 --> 12:58.362
And it represents subjects that
we only share with each other,

12:58.529 --> 13:02.533
details of physical intimacy,
bathroom habits...

13:02.700 --> 13:07.746
Although, as I'm saying it I may
need to add Dr. Fink in here.

13:08.789 --> 13:11.750
Are you really worried about
revealing secrets to Stephen Hawking?

13:12.084 --> 13:16.380
No, I was just excited
to list him as a friend.

13:17.214 --> 13:19.383
Well, I do appreciate you working on this.

13:21.469 --> 13:23.220
I'm sorry you were embarrassed,

13:23.387 --> 13:27.766
and now I understand that some things
are just between you and me,

13:27.933 --> 13:31.479
and in the event of redness
and swelling, Dr. Fink.

13:34.773 --> 13:35.983
What's that little dot in the middle?

13:37.026 --> 13:39.361
That's reserved for thoughts
I don't share with anyone.

13:40.154 --> 13:41.322
Interesting.

13:41.489 --> 13:43.532
You really have secrets you don't tell me?

13:44.074 --> 13:45.242
Of course.

13:45.743 --> 13:46.785
Can I hear one?

13:47.453 --> 13:48.913
No, they're private.

13:50.206 --> 13:52.625
Why, are they naughty?

13:54.627 --> 13:55.836
A little.

13:56.170 --> 13:57.338
Please?

13:59.298 --> 14:02.259
Fine. Two years ago...

14:04.678 --> 14:06.847
I got my driver's license.

14:09.308 --> 14:13.604
What? Why didn't you say anything?

14:14.104 --> 14:17.149
Well, I like being chauffeured around.

14:17.316 --> 14:19.276
It makes me feel important.

14:20.986 --> 14:24.198
So, when I got up at 4:00 a.m.
to drive you across the desert

14:24.365 --> 14:27.117
to an antique train museum,
I didn't have to?

14:27.284 --> 14:28.494
No, you didn't.

14:28.994 --> 14:33.249
But keep in mind,
I felt extremely important.

14:39.463 --> 14:40.923
<i>What?</i>

14:41.799 --> 14:44.051
Hello, Father, we need to talk.

14:44.260 --> 14:45.469
<i>All right.</i>

14:45.636 --> 14:47.179
I have come to an important decision.

14:47.346 --> 14:49.181
I will not be accepting
your money anymore.

14:49.765 --> 14:51.850
I'm a man and I can take care of myself.

14:52.017 --> 14:53.269
<i>That's wonderful!</i>

14:53.435 --> 14:54.478
Yes, that is wonderful,

14:54.645 --> 14:57.147
you will no longer be able
to accuse me of being spoiled.

14:57.356 --> 14:59.984
<i>- I'm so proud of you.</i>
- Dad, I'm trying to tell you off

15:00.150 --> 15:03.696
and you're ruining it
with your delight and relief.

15:04.613 --> 15:07.366
<i>Sorry. Oh, no, my grown son</i>

15:07.533 --> 15:09.159
<i>is going to stop spending all my money,</i>

15:09.326 --> 15:12.079
<i>where did I fail as a father?</i>

15:13.122 --> 15:15.457
Yeah, that's right,
keep asking yourself that!

15:16.959 --> 15:20.212
But I still love you very much,
so don't cut me out of the will.

15:25.843 --> 15:28.512
Hey, you brought your own lunch,
good for you.

15:28.679 --> 15:32.891
Yeah, I'm making a bunch of changes.
This morning I fired my dog walker.

15:33.392 --> 15:35.311
How's the dog gonna go to the bathroom?

15:35.519 --> 15:38.355
Ah, I gave her an Imodium.
That's tomorrow's problem.

15:40.816 --> 15:43.527
Excuse me,
may I have your attention, please.

15:45.112 --> 15:46.280
I have recently been made aware

15:46.447 --> 15:49.199
that my personal relationship
with Amy Farrah Fowler

15:49.366 --> 15:50.951
has become water cooler gossip.

15:51.368 --> 15:54.705
And I just want to say
shame on all of you.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.541
Now, we're scientists.

15:57.708 --> 16:01.295
Our minds should be focused on
the advancement of human knowledge,

16:01.462 --> 16:03.797
not the intimate details
of other people's lives.

16:04.715 --> 16:08.969
He's right. And I'm sorry
for the part I played in this.

16:09.803 --> 16:12.389
Thank you, Bert. You're a good man.

16:12.556 --> 16:16.185
That woman who stood you up and humiliated
you last night really missed out.

16:18.312 --> 16:21.023
That doesn't paint me in the best light.

16:21.231 --> 16:24.109
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Correction.

16:24.276 --> 16:27.363
That woman not only had
vigorous coitus with Bert

16:28.739 --> 16:31.950
but she also tipped him
a dollar for a job well done.

16:35.287 --> 16:37.289
- That better?
- Not really.

16:39.249 --> 16:42.419
All right, well to sum up,
focus on science,

16:42.586 --> 16:44.588
keep your nose
out of other people's business

16:44.755 --> 16:46.965
and for a good time, call Bert.

16:54.390 --> 16:55.599
What brought that on?

16:56.016 --> 16:59.269
Well, last night Amy was angry with me

16:59.603 --> 17:02.981
because I'd been foolishly telling people
about certain personal matters.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.775
That's understandable.

17:04.942 --> 17:06.276
I know that now.

17:06.443 --> 17:10.322
At first I thought she was cranky
because of her horrific menstrual cramps,

17:11.657 --> 17:15.452
but it turns out no,
she was genuinely mortified.

17:43.897 --> 17:44.940
