WEBVTT

00:03.838 --> 00:05.423
What's going on
with that woman you're dating?

00:05.590 --> 00:07.425
- I broke up with her.
- Why?

00:07.592 --> 00:10.929
She said she didn't want to see me anymore
and I found that insulting.

00:12.389 --> 00:14.224
I thought things were going well.
What happened?

00:14.474 --> 00:16.851
I don't know.
She didn't even give me a reason.

00:17.018 --> 00:18.603
That's not a problem,
we can figure this out.

00:18.770 --> 00:22.023
What are the reasons women reject Raj?

00:23.692 --> 00:25.568
Look, can we not play this game?

00:25.735 --> 00:27.570
Doesn't like games, that's one.

00:29.531 --> 00:31.783
- Ignore him.
- Yeah, sorry about the breakup.

00:31.950 --> 00:33.159
That's okay, I'm fine.

00:33.326 --> 00:34.411
<i>Of course you're fine.</i>

00:34.577 --> 00:36.955
Not every member of a species
finds a mate.

00:37.122 --> 00:40.792
Sir Isaac Newton died a virgin,
look at the contributions he made.

00:42.377 --> 00:44.003
I'm not a virgin, Sheldon.

00:44.170 --> 00:46.756
So now you think you're better
than Isaac Newton?

00:48.383 --> 00:49.759
No wonder women don't like you.

00:51.720 --> 00:52.929
You're not being very nice.

00:53.096 --> 00:54.514
What? He said he was fine.

00:54.681 --> 00:56.975
Sometimes people say things
they don't mean.

00:57.142 --> 00:58.643
That's a paradox.

00:58.810 --> 01:00.270
If you meant what you just said,

01:00.437 --> 01:02.897
then that means you may not have meant
what you just said.

01:03.606 --> 01:06.985
Careful, I saw this on <i>Star Trek.</i>
Smoke's gonna come out of his ears soon.

01:09.154 --> 01:10.822
- Hey.
- Hey, boys. How's it goin'?

01:10.989 --> 01:12.866
I thought we were having
a nice conversation,

01:13.032 --> 01:15.410
but it turns out I was being offensive.

01:15.577 --> 01:17.078
So, normal?

01:18.288 --> 01:19.456
Sheldon, what did you do?

01:19.873 --> 01:24.085
We were discussing Raj's recent breakup
and apparently I was insensitive to him.

01:24.252 --> 01:25.754
It's okay, I'm fine.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.338
You didn't... Don't fall for it.

01:27.505 --> 01:29.340
Now he'll get you to compare him
to a dead virgin,

01:29.507 --> 01:30.967
and suddenly you're the bad guy.

01:32.802 --> 01:34.387
Sheldon, when I said I was fine,

01:34.554 --> 01:36.389
I meant I didn't wanna
talk about it anymore.

01:36.931 --> 01:38.308
Then why didn't you say that?

01:38.475 --> 01:39.768
Because that's not what people do.

01:39.934 --> 01:42.812
Well, I would prefer if people told me
exactly what is on their mind.

01:42.979 --> 01:46.024
No, no, you don't, you really don't.
I actually can't say "don't" enough.

01:47.484 --> 01:49.194
Well, it certainly would be easier.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.070
You have no idea what it's like

01:51.237 --> 01:53.907
to struggle
with recognizing emotional cues.

01:54.073 --> 01:56.534
- I'm sure it's extremely frustrating.
- Thank you.

01:56.701 --> 01:57.869
And also a little sad.

01:58.036 --> 01:59.871
Okay, now you're just showing off.

02:01.998 --> 02:03.666
You know, I just read that a team at MIT

02:03.833 --> 02:06.753
developed a device
that helps people read human emotions.

02:06.920 --> 02:10.006
And you think we can get those guys
to reprogram Sheldon? Cool.

02:11.424 --> 02:14.135
It's supposed to be accurate,
like, 85% of the time.

02:14.302 --> 02:15.762
Wow, I find that hard to believe.

02:15.929 --> 02:19.182
That a bunch of awkward scientists
with no social skills

02:19.349 --> 02:21.059
would invent a machine to do it for them?

02:21.267 --> 02:22.393
I take it back, I believe it.

02:23.853 --> 02:26.397
You know, if it's at MIT,
I can make some calls.

02:26.564 --> 02:28.024
Maybe we can get Sheldon a prototype.

02:28.942 --> 02:30.401
What do you think?

02:30.735 --> 02:33.613
A machine that reads emotions
is intriguing.

02:33.780 --> 02:36.407
It could help me be
a more considerate friend.

02:36.699 --> 02:37.951
Wouldn't that be nice.

02:38.117 --> 02:42.080
It could also help me identify my enemies,
discover their fears and then...

02:43.248 --> 02:45.416
I could use those fears to destroy them.

02:48.127 --> 02:49.546
I like the first one.

03:17.323 --> 03:18.491
Now that Sheldon's across the hall,

03:18.658 --> 03:20.785
have you decided what you're doing
with his old room?

03:20.952 --> 03:23.788
I was thinking maybe a library
or a gaming room.

03:24.038 --> 03:25.665
You could make it a train room.

03:25.874 --> 03:27.208
I don't like trains, you like trains.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.794
I know, and Amy says
I can't have a train room.

03:31.588 --> 03:34.841
Sheldon, I just heard from the guys at MIT
about that emotion reader.

03:35.008 --> 03:37.051
They're sending a prototype
for you to beta test.

03:37.468 --> 03:38.720
Wonderful.

03:38.887 --> 03:41.931
Although, I'm not sure how I feel
about being used as a guinea pig.

03:42.140 --> 03:44.642
Well, when you get the machine
you can find out.

03:46.311 --> 03:49.814
Maybe I could use it to understand
why women keep dumping me.

03:49.981 --> 03:51.399
Well, you don't need a machine for that.

03:51.566 --> 03:53.318
Just send a survey card
to all your ex-girlfriends

03:53.484 --> 03:55.361
and tell them if they fill it out
they might win a prize.

03:56.863 --> 03:58.031
That's actually not a bad idea.

03:58.406 --> 04:01.159
Maybe I could even get them all together,
sort of like a...

04:01.326 --> 04:03.161
A focus group
to find out what's wrong with me.

04:03.494 --> 04:06.122
No, Raj, that's a terrible idea.

04:06.289 --> 04:07.498
Yeah, I was joking.

04:08.166 --> 04:09.417
Really?

04:09.584 --> 04:11.252
A little tip, jokes are often better

04:11.419 --> 04:14.047
when you end them
with "wockawocka" or "ha-cha-cha."

04:17.759 --> 04:20.136
Great news, the TV I want
will fit in the gaming room,

04:20.303 --> 04:23.181
and if I leave the curtains open,
I can watch it from work.

04:25.183 --> 04:26.559
Hey, can you hold off redoing that room?

04:26.726 --> 04:28.603
My brother's comin' out here
in a few weeks.

04:28.770 --> 04:30.939
Yeah, okay, sure.
What's going on with your brother?

04:31.189 --> 04:33.358
My dad asked if I can get him
a job interview at my work.

04:34.192 --> 04:35.401
Is that a good idea?

04:35.568 --> 04:38.988
I mean, you think they'll consider someone
who was in prison for selling drugs?

04:39.197 --> 04:41.324
Well, I sell pharmaceuticals.

04:41.491 --> 04:44.035
Which is just a really
hard-to-spell word for drugs.

04:45.995 --> 04:47.455
Well, I'm sure he'll appreciate

04:47.622 --> 04:50.375
carrying his samples in a briefcase
instead of his colon.

04:53.378 --> 04:54.712
How long do you think he'll stay?

04:55.046 --> 04:58.925
I'm not sure. Maybe a few days.
Unless he gets the job, then who knows?

04:59.717 --> 05:01.469
"Who knows?" That's exciting.

05:01.636 --> 05:04.389
I'll get to wake up every morning
and see if he's still here.

05:05.723 --> 05:07.183
You don't have a problem
with this, do you?

05:07.350 --> 05:09.102
No, of course not.
I mean, he's your brother.

05:09.394 --> 05:11.229
Okay, thank you. You're the best.

05:11.646 --> 05:12.814
Remember that when the new TV

05:13.022 --> 05:15.191
falls off the wall and crushes us both.

05:18.695 --> 05:19.779
This thing's pretty cool.

05:19.946 --> 05:22.407
It interprets emotions
using a wireless signal

05:22.573 --> 05:25.368
to analyze subtle changes
in breathing and heart rate.

05:25.743 --> 05:27.954
- It's amazing a machine can do that.
<i>- Yes.</i>

05:28.121 --> 05:29.706
Now when the robots rise up,

05:29.872 --> 05:32.542
they'll know that I've been
rooting for them the whole time.

05:34.002 --> 05:35.962
The display is synced to your phone.

05:36.129 --> 05:38.297
- Give it a try.
- All right.

05:38.464 --> 05:41.759
Now I'm gonna look at some pictures
to prompt an emotional response

05:41.926 --> 05:44.053
and we'll see if the machine
can identify them accurately.

05:44.220 --> 05:46.556
Remember, it can only detect
happy, sad, angry and excited.

05:46.723 --> 05:49.934
Not other things you're feeling,
like, "What have I done with my life?"

05:54.188 --> 05:56.607
Okay, I'm looking at the first picture.

05:57.567 --> 06:00.778
You are... Happy?

06:01.279 --> 06:03.948
- Yes. I'm looking at puppies.
- Aw.

06:04.449 --> 06:07.452
Okay. Somebody's ignoring
their tiny needle teeth, but all right.

06:08.870 --> 06:10.413
- Try another one.
- Okay.

06:11.748 --> 06:13.124
What does it say I'm feeling?

06:14.083 --> 06:15.710
- Sad.
- Yes,

06:15.877 --> 06:17.336
I'm looking at a picture of my grandma.

06:17.879 --> 06:20.506
That makes sense.
'Cause she's gone and you miss her.

06:20.673 --> 06:21.674
Yes.

06:21.841 --> 06:24.177
And you're worried
that turkey neck is in your future.

06:28.598 --> 06:31.184
See, now it says you're mad.
Make up your mind.

06:35.813 --> 06:39.317
Okay, Emily, that sounds great.
See you then.

06:39.942 --> 06:41.486
Is that Emily your ex-girlfriend?

06:41.652 --> 06:44.530
Yeah. I'm getting all my exes together
in order to discuss

06:44.697 --> 06:47.700
why they broke up with me
and how I can be a better boyfriend.

06:48.326 --> 06:50.661
Oh, God, you went through with that?
What is wrong with you?

06:50.828 --> 06:52.288
We are going find out.

06:54.665 --> 06:56.042
Why would you do that, Raj?

06:56.209 --> 06:58.753
Well, I want information
in order to improve myself.

06:59.003 --> 07:00.505
You're not gonna get information,

07:00.671 --> 07:03.508
you're just gonna get criticism
that hurts your feelings.

07:03.674 --> 07:06.219
Don't worry, I'm a grown man.
I have a thick skin.

07:06.677 --> 07:08.846
- You're so stupid.
- Hey!

07:13.017 --> 07:14.685
Hey, will you take a look
at my brother's resume?

07:14.852 --> 07:16.187
I'm trying to help him
clean it up a little.

07:16.354 --> 07:17.355
Sure.

07:20.024 --> 07:22.443
He really worked
with the Drug Enforcement Agency?

07:22.860 --> 07:25.321
He didn't know it until he was cuffed,
but yeah.

07:27.323 --> 07:29.700
Hey, Leonard,
if you're happy and you know it,

07:29.867 --> 07:33.579
no need to clap your hands
because I have an emotion detector.

07:35.039 --> 07:37.166
- How's it working out?
- Surprisingly well.

07:37.333 --> 07:38.668
That's great, I'm happy for you.

07:38.835 --> 07:40.086
Hold on.

07:41.170 --> 07:43.131
What? You are. Aren't you sweet?

07:44.882 --> 07:46.134
What's that?
Are you workin' on your resume?

07:46.300 --> 07:48.886
No, it's my brother's.
I'm tryin' to help him get a job out here.

07:49.095 --> 07:51.264
Ooh, and that makes Leonard angry.

07:53.432 --> 07:54.433
No, it doesn't.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.436
Leonard, please.
I know an angry face when I see it.

07:57.603 --> 07:59.605
It's this red frowny guy on my phone.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.359
What? Are you really upset
about Randall coming?

08:03.526 --> 08:05.361
- No!
- Yes.

08:05.903 --> 08:08.281
- I said no.
- It's like you're twins.

08:09.907 --> 08:11.993
Leonard, if you're mad about this,
just tell me.

08:13.411 --> 08:17.582
Fine, you invited your drug dealer brother
to stay with us for God knows how long,

08:17.748 --> 08:19.250
and didn't bother to ask me first.

08:19.417 --> 08:21.919
He's my brother,
I didn't think I needed your permission.

08:22.086 --> 08:23.963
Hey, now she's angry, too.

08:24.922 --> 08:26.382
This thing works like gangbusters.

08:32.221 --> 08:33.806
I'm not saying
you have to ask my permission,

08:33.973 --> 08:36.767
but you could have talked to me about it
before you said it was okay.

08:36.934 --> 08:38.769
Like you talked to me
about your gaming room?

08:39.020 --> 08:42.523
<i>Our</i> gaming room!
I was gonna put a scented candle in it.

08:43.774 --> 08:44.984
He's still mad.

08:45.610 --> 08:47.069
Stop enjoying their fight.

08:48.487 --> 08:49.697
You first.

08:51.324 --> 08:53.951
If you were this upset, why didn't you
say so when I first told you?

08:54.118 --> 08:56.120
Because I didn't wanna sound like a jerk.

08:56.287 --> 08:57.288
Well, you sound like one now.

08:57.455 --> 08:59.957
I don't see the big deal
if my brother comes and stays for a while.

09:00.124 --> 09:01.959
If you get him a job,
he's gonna live here forever.

09:02.126 --> 09:03.544
He would get his own place.

09:03.711 --> 09:06.047
- Has he ever had his own place?
- Yes!

09:06.214 --> 09:08.716
Did it have a metal toilet
next to the bed?

09:10.301 --> 09:11.552
It still counts!

09:11.719 --> 09:15.097
You know, how is this any different
from you making me live with Sheldon?

09:15.514 --> 09:18.517
Hey! I shared
my Honey Nut Cheerios with you.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.772
You gave me a bill
at the end of every month.

09:25.191 --> 09:26.192
Stay out of this.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.818
You and your stupid machine
started this fight.

09:28.319 --> 09:31.864
You are lucky that this feelings
machine doesn't have feelings.

09:33.157 --> 09:35.159
- Come on, Sheldon. Let's go.
- Gladly.

09:35.326 --> 09:36.369
Can we storm out?

09:36.535 --> 09:39.413
I think it loses its impact
if we're chatting about it.

09:39.705 --> 09:41.290
Fine, I'll just give them the finger.

09:46.379 --> 09:51.175
Okay, first off I want to thank you all
so much for coming.

09:51.634 --> 09:54.845
Howard is here to interpret for Emily
and to take notes.

09:57.556 --> 09:59.517
No, he doesn't think it's stupid.

10:00.810 --> 10:03.521
Heads up. Both of you are named Emily,

10:03.688 --> 10:06.148
so we'll call you "Red-headed Emily,"

10:06.315 --> 10:09.860
and you "Red-headed Emily Junior."

10:14.824 --> 10:16.409
Hey, you went out with him, I didn't.

10:18.411 --> 10:20.705
Okay, let's get things started.

10:21.414 --> 10:23.165
Why don't we go around the room,

10:23.332 --> 10:26.168
say your name
and why you broke up with me.

10:26.335 --> 10:27.420
Wanna kick it off?

10:28.337 --> 10:29.588
Okay. Um...

10:30.548 --> 10:35.720
I'm Lucy and I broke up with Raj
because I have severe social anxiety,

10:35.886 --> 10:38.806
and he kept trying to force me
into uncomfortable situations.

10:40.433 --> 10:41.642
Like this one?

10:42.268 --> 10:43.352
Yeah.

10:43.728 --> 10:47.690
I did do that. I can be insensitive
to other people's boundaries.

10:47.857 --> 10:49.108
Howard, would you write that down?

10:49.275 --> 10:51.068
"Schmuck." Got it.

10:52.069 --> 10:53.112
Next?

10:54.322 --> 10:55.698
Okay.

10:56.490 --> 10:57.575
I'm Claire.

10:57.742 --> 11:01.579
And I guess I broke up with you
because you were just really needy.

11:02.371 --> 11:03.914
Also, you know, you were incredibly vain,

11:04.081 --> 11:06.083
like, all the time you spend
shaping your eyebrows...

11:06.250 --> 11:08.419
Okay, new rule, everybody only gets one.

11:10.046 --> 11:11.047
Next?

11:12.089 --> 11:13.591
I'm not sure I'm comfortable

11:13.758 --> 11:16.052
sharing details about our relationship
in front of Howard.

11:16.927 --> 11:17.928
He's here to support me,

11:18.095 --> 11:19.930
so anything you have to say,
you can say in front of him.

11:20.348 --> 11:22.975
Okay. Well,
whenever you and I were in bed...

11:23.142 --> 11:24.602
Howard, get out.

11:26.645 --> 11:27.938
Not a chance.

11:28.606 --> 11:31.609
So, you were telling us
how Raj was terrible in bed.

11:35.446 --> 11:37.156
Sheldon, dinner's ready.

11:37.740 --> 11:38.783
I made beef-loaf

11:38.949 --> 11:42.536
because I know you're uncomfortable
with the non-specificity of meatloaf.

11:43.788 --> 11:44.789
Sheldon?

11:49.877 --> 11:52.254
- Hey, are you okay?
- Not really.

11:52.838 --> 11:53.881
What's going on?

11:54.173 --> 11:55.841
I wish I never tried that device.

11:56.634 --> 11:58.803
And I know I said the same thing
after the massage chair,

11:58.969 --> 12:00.471
but this time I mean it.

12:01.931 --> 12:03.974
I'm sorry Leonard and Penny
hurt your feelings.

12:05.142 --> 12:07.269
It's more than that. It's me.

12:08.145 --> 12:11.565
I always knew I had trouble
recognizing other people's emotions,

12:11.732 --> 12:13.818
but that machine just made it so real.

12:15.152 --> 12:17.655
Well, everybody has things
that they need help with.

12:17.822 --> 12:20.116
Like me, I can't see without my glasses.

12:20.282 --> 12:21.575
You know, right now you're just a...

12:21.742 --> 12:24.495
A cute pink smudge
wearing a childish green smudge.

12:26.288 --> 12:28.874
I thought I was getting better at it,
but clearly I'm not.

12:30.334 --> 12:31.877
Yes, you are.

12:32.420 --> 12:35.714
There have definitely been days
when I was sad and you could tell.

12:35.881 --> 12:38.008
Yeah, but that's shooting
fish in a barrel.

12:38.175 --> 12:39.385
You're kind of a sad sack.

12:42.847 --> 12:45.433
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
I'm just upset.

12:46.475 --> 12:47.685
See, right there.

12:48.018 --> 12:49.520
You knew you hurt my feelings.

12:49.687 --> 12:54.066
And I'm proud of you for reasons I'm sure
have something to do with my father.

12:56.402 --> 12:59.321
And if you don't like that machine,
get rid of it.

13:00.573 --> 13:02.575
Because I love you
exactly the way you are.

13:11.167 --> 13:12.710
I feel the same way about you.

13:15.171 --> 13:17.047
Now put your glasses back on,
you look weird.

13:22.261 --> 13:25.890
"I thought you were great,
but, oh, my God,

13:26.056 --> 13:28.017
"you were so dominated by your parents."

13:28.184 --> 13:31.770
Yeah, that used to drive me nuts.
He's kind of a mama's boy.

13:31.937 --> 13:33.898
- Kind of?
- Okay, that's enough.

13:34.940 --> 13:36.400
Write down "loving son."

13:38.569 --> 13:39.570
Can I just say something?

13:40.988 --> 13:42.281
Going out with Raj

13:42.448 --> 13:44.909
was one of the best things
that ever happened to me.

13:45.075 --> 13:46.494
Yes, I'll take you back.

13:50.247 --> 13:51.332
Let me finish.

13:52.166 --> 13:54.376
It's like I needed
to go through that experience

13:54.543 --> 13:57.296
to know what exactly
I don't want in a man.

13:58.380 --> 14:00.925
Well, that's hard to hear,
but I'll still take you back.

14:02.343 --> 14:04.428
You know, the same thing happened to me.

14:04.595 --> 14:08.474
After I broke up with Raj,
I met Gary who's just amazing.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.601
Sorry, is that Gary with one "R" or two?

14:10.768 --> 14:12.645
Would you stop writing?

14:13.437 --> 14:17.608
Wait, so, did all of you
go on to better relationships after me?

14:17.858 --> 14:19.109
- Oh, yeah.
- Without question.

14:19.276 --> 14:20.653
Little before, actually.

14:24.865 --> 14:25.866
Oh.

14:26.492 --> 14:28.744
Wow. Don't let him get away.

14:28.994 --> 14:30.538
Wait. What did she say?

14:30.746 --> 14:33.666
Basically, she traded you
for a Bruce Wayne.

14:36.210 --> 14:38.212
Okay. Maybe we should just end this.

14:38.963 --> 14:40.422
Well, hang on.

14:40.589 --> 14:42.883
I just want to point out to everyone here,

14:43.050 --> 14:47.471
this is a man who is going
to great lengths to better himself.

14:48.222 --> 14:53.769
Even at the risk of being humiliated.
And I, for one, think that's very brave.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.020
Thank you, Howard.

14:55.521 --> 14:58.315
Honestly, I'm surprised
you two didn't wind up together.

15:02.027 --> 15:03.404
Well, like you gals,

15:03.571 --> 15:05.739
I had to suffer through him
to find Bernadette.

15:12.788 --> 15:15.332
- Yes?
- We owe you an apology.

15:16.208 --> 15:20.504
It's fine. You needed a suitcase,
I wasn't home, you borrowed a suitcase.

15:21.297 --> 15:23.424
That was six years ago.
I'm talking about tonight.

15:24.508 --> 15:25.509
Oh.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.761
I thought we were going in order.

15:30.306 --> 15:31.599
Look, we got really angry at each other

15:31.765 --> 15:32.850
and you just got caught
in the middle of it.

15:33.684 --> 15:35.102
And sorry about the suitcase.

15:35.269 --> 15:36.312
Yeah, well, you should be.

15:36.478 --> 15:38.647
Your socks were still in it.
I had to throw it away.

15:40.024 --> 15:42.860
Anyway, I trust
that you've resolved your conflict?

15:43.193 --> 15:45.529
- Yes, we're fine.
- Penny's gonna call her dad and tell him

15:45.696 --> 15:47.156
it's not a good time for Randall to visit.

15:47.323 --> 15:48.532
Hopefully, he won't be too upset.

15:49.491 --> 15:51.201
You're his little girl,
he can't stay mad at you.

15:51.827 --> 15:52.911
He won't be mad at me.

15:53.078 --> 15:55.873
I mean, you're the one
who doesn't want my brother to come. So...

15:57.082 --> 15:58.917
So you're gonna throw me under the bus?

15:59.084 --> 16:02.671
Oh, I'm gonna throw you so hard,
I might actually win a stuffed animal.

16:06.175 --> 16:08.886
Guys, it sounds
like you're getting angry again.

16:09.136 --> 16:10.721
- That's because we are.
- Yes!

16:10.888 --> 16:13.390
I don't need an emotion machine, I am one!

16:17.978 --> 16:19.897
Thanks, ladies, this was fun!

16:20.064 --> 16:23.025
Let's not wait so long
for another bizarre, awkward night.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.655
That was a waste of time.
I'm such an idiot.

16:27.863 --> 16:30.199
Don't beat yourself up.
That's what I'm here for.

16:31.450 --> 16:33.619
Maybe I won't settle down.
Maybe I'll just play the field.

16:33.911 --> 16:36.413
Yeah, the field was just here.
The field said no.

16:39.208 --> 16:40.250
Dude, come on.

16:41.168 --> 16:43.212
Okay, I'll tell you what,
I'll make you a deal.

16:43.379 --> 16:45.422
Thirty years from now,
if you're still single

16:45.589 --> 16:47.508
and things don't work out
with me and Bernadette,

16:48.384 --> 16:50.260
you and I can give it a go.

16:51.345 --> 16:53.639
I appreciate the offer,
but if things don't work out with you two,

16:53.806 --> 16:55.140
I'm swooping in on her like a vulture.

16:56.725 --> 16:58.394
Too late. Stuart called dibs.

16:59.478 --> 17:01.188
But, theoretically,

17:01.689 --> 17:04.608
if you and I were in a gay relationship,

17:04.775 --> 17:07.611
how would we tell people?
Like, print up announcements?

17:08.946 --> 17:10.572
I don't know.
What difference does it make?

17:10.739 --> 17:13.450
Well, I wanna make sure
we get invited to all the parades.

17:14.785 --> 17:15.786
Those do look fun.

17:15.953 --> 17:17.037
Yeah. Well,

17:17.204 --> 17:20.624
if you wanna march in a fishnet crop-top
you better lay off that dip.

17:22.126 --> 17:23.669
If you didn't want me to eat it,
why'd you put it out?

17:23.836 --> 17:26.672
It was for the girls. They broke up
with me, I don't care if <i>they</i> get fat.

17:28.507 --> 17:29.675
I'm not gonna get fat.

17:29.842 --> 17:32.761
You wanna bet? You never exercise.

17:33.470 --> 17:35.764
Fine. Look, I'll exercise right now.

17:36.348 --> 17:37.641
One.

17:38.934 --> 17:40.310
Two.

17:41.937 --> 17:43.731
These are crunches, by the way.

17:43.939 --> 17:46.358
Very mature. Keep eating like that,
you're gonna have a heart attack.

17:46.608 --> 17:48.485
Okay. How about if I eat like this?

17:53.198 --> 17:54.950
You're such a child!

17:55.117 --> 17:57.536
Hey, is that any way
to talk to your future husband?

17:57.703 --> 18:00.539
Hey. I was being hypothetical, okay?
I would never marry you.

18:00.706 --> 18:02.750
Please. When you see the ring I pick out,
you're gonna melt.

18:02.916 --> 18:03.917
Yeah, right.

18:04.543 --> 18:05.544
Wait, is it rose gold?

18:05.711 --> 18:07.755
Actually, don't tell me.
I wanna be surprised.

18:15.012 --> 18:16.680
So, did you wind up
sending that machine back?

18:16.847 --> 18:19.808
I did. You know, I'm not even sure
how accurate it was.

18:19.975 --> 18:22.895
I took it to the train store.
It said everyone was sad.

18:25.814 --> 18:27.566
I finally got Halley to sleep.

18:27.816 --> 18:30.527
You know, I just read a study
that suggests new mothers are better

18:30.694 --> 18:33.447
- at sensing emotions for up to two years.
- It's true.

18:33.614 --> 18:35.699
Pregnancy causes physiological changes
in the brain

18:35.866 --> 18:37.326
that result in increased empathy.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.953
Oh! So all we need to do
is get Sheldon knocked up.

18:42.206 --> 18:44.500
We can't, he was already fixed
when I found him at the shelter.

18:46.502 --> 18:50.088
Hey, Bernadette, let's test this theory.
What do you think I'm feeling right now?

18:50.672 --> 18:54.551
Let's see. You're better than us,
a little bit sorry for us,

18:54.718 --> 18:57.679
but mostly glad you don't have to be us.

19:00.724 --> 19:02.518
Keep filling this one with babies,
she's good.

19:33.423 --> 19:34.424
English - SDH
