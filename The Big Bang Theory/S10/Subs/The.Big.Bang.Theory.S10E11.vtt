WEBVTT

00:02.170 --> 00:03.922
<i>Previously on</i> The Big Bang Theory...

00:04.130 --> 00:05.757
Hey, Stuart. What are you doing here?

00:06.091 --> 00:08.802
- Oh, I'm living here again.
- Do Howard and Bernadette know?

00:11.221 --> 00:13.181
Or is it like a possum in the walls
kind of thing?

00:15.600 --> 00:18.103
No, I needed a place to stay and,

00:18.269 --> 00:20.605
with the baby coming,
I figured they could use some extra help.

00:21.564 --> 00:23.316
Hey, tomorrow, who wants to paint
the nursery?

00:23.483 --> 00:24.484
I'll do it.

00:24.693 --> 00:26.361
Why do you get to do it? I'm the artist.

00:26.528 --> 00:28.947
Just because you're starving,
doesn't make you an artist.

00:30.323 --> 00:32.534
Just because I look sickly,
doesn't mean I'm starving.

00:34.202 --> 00:36.913
Howard! I think I'm in labor.

00:37.372 --> 00:41.835
Whoa, whoa, okay.
Okay, uh, I can do this. We have a plan.

00:42.669 --> 00:44.295
Somebody please tell me the plan.

00:44.879 --> 00:46.464
- I'll get the hospital bag.
- I'll pull the van up.

00:46.673 --> 00:48.800
- Meet you outside in two minutes.
- Team Baby, go!

00:53.471 --> 00:57.475
Oh, man. This is really happening.
You doing okay?

00:57.642 --> 00:59.352
Here comes another contraction.

00:59.519 --> 01:00.687
Let's pick it up.

01:00.854 --> 01:03.898
All right. Hold on, I'm going to drive
like we do in India.

01:05.150 --> 01:08.528
Get out of the way, you syphilitic dogs!

01:10.280 --> 01:11.906
Stop that, this isn't India.

01:12.198 --> 01:13.491
Fine.

01:13.742 --> 01:16.578
What do 1.3 billion people
know about having babies?

01:18.121 --> 01:20.373
Sorry, I know you're just trying to help.

01:20.999 --> 01:23.376
- I love you.
- I love you, too. We're good.

01:52.781 --> 01:55.033
Amy? Wake up.

01:57.535 --> 01:58.703
What's wrong?

01:58.870 --> 01:59.954
It's midnight.

02:00.789 --> 02:01.915
Happy birthday.

02:02.957 --> 02:05.794
Sheldon.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.592
Okay, you can have this back
in the morning.

02:13.718 --> 02:16.930
All right. This is for you.

02:17.555 --> 02:18.681
I was going to wrap it

02:18.890 --> 02:21.184
but touching Scotch tape
gives me the heebie-jeebies.

02:22.393 --> 02:24.521
I'll put it on the list
with peaches and felt.

02:27.565 --> 02:28.733
What is this?

02:28.983 --> 02:31.194
A functional MRI of my brain.

02:32.737 --> 02:35.031
I did Sudoku before they took it
so I'd be ripped.

02:37.617 --> 02:39.160
I love it, thank you.

02:39.410 --> 02:40.578
And it's not just an MRI,

02:40.745 --> 02:43.915
the orbitofrontal cortex is lit up
because I was thinking of you.

02:45.124 --> 02:46.125
Sheldon.

02:50.839 --> 02:53.007
We seem to be moving on to the annual

02:53.174 --> 02:55.009
coitus portion
of your birthday festivities.

02:56.553 --> 02:57.554
Is that okay?

02:57.804 --> 03:00.223
I didn't put on my come-hither
plaid pj's for nothing.

03:02.433 --> 03:04.936
You hate Scotch tape,
but you love Scotch plaid.

03:05.103 --> 03:06.104
You are a mystery.

03:15.321 --> 03:17.949
<i>Guys, wake up.
Bernadette's having her baby.</i>

03:18.199 --> 03:19.826
<i>Come on,
we're going to the hospital.</i>

03:20.743 --> 03:21.870
I guess we should stop.

03:22.620 --> 03:23.913
I'm afraid so.

03:25.832 --> 03:27.750
Childbirth, looming coitus?

03:27.917 --> 03:29.752
It's a banner night for female genitals.

03:33.590 --> 03:35.008
Now, I see three of you.

03:35.300 --> 03:38.469
Do we know the father or is this
some <i>Mamma Mia!</i> nonsense?

03:40.388 --> 03:41.556
I'm the father.

03:41.973 --> 03:44.142
Okay, Dad,
how far apart are the contractions?

03:44.976 --> 03:46.144
No idea, ask him.

03:47.770 --> 03:48.813
Twelve minutes.

03:48.980 --> 03:50.857
Twelve minutes? Why are you here?

03:51.316 --> 03:53.318
Aren't we supposed to get here
an hour and a half early?

03:53.943 --> 03:56.154
This is a hospital, not the airport.

03:57.947 --> 03:59.490
I'm sorry, it's our first time.

03:59.824 --> 04:00.909
Oh, it's okay.

04:01.117 --> 04:03.077
This little one will be here
before you know it.

04:03.661 --> 04:06.414
- Do we know what we're having?
- No, we're keeping it a surprise.

04:06.706 --> 04:08.666
Old school, nice.

04:09.167 --> 04:11.836
Eh. Not that old school, he knows.

04:12.503 --> 04:15.840
You see, I was at the doctor's office,

04:16.007 --> 04:19.260
the folder was right there,
so I took a peek.

04:19.427 --> 04:22.555
And talking
like this doesn't make it less creepy.

04:24.223 --> 04:25.642
Sweetheart, go home.

04:25.808 --> 04:28.728
Come back when the contractions
are five minutes apart for an hour.

04:29.062 --> 04:31.773
I'm sorry, that's ambiguous.
Is it five minutes apart

04:32.023 --> 04:33.358
starting at the top of the hour

04:33.524 --> 04:35.568
or five minutes apart
starting with the first contraction,

04:35.735 --> 04:37.820
so essentially, like, 65 minutes?

04:40.406 --> 04:42.033
I'm just throwing this out there,

04:42.283 --> 04:45.036
but home births
are very popular these days.

04:48.706 --> 04:50.458
Sheldon, what took you so long?

04:50.667 --> 04:52.335
Wolowitz might hand out cigars.

04:52.543 --> 04:55.838
I had to find my bubble gum cigar so
I could join in without looking foolish.

04:57.715 --> 04:59.008
Damn, I need my inhaler.

04:59.384 --> 05:01.511
- Just don't smoke.
- No, I went down the stairs too fast.

05:04.138 --> 05:05.181
Hey.

05:05.348 --> 05:06.933
Don't come to the hospital,
we're headed home.

05:07.392 --> 05:09.560
That was fast,
did she sneeze the baby out?

05:11.229 --> 05:13.272
We showed up too early.
We'll keep you posted.

05:13.523 --> 05:15.733
Okay. Well,
we'll talk to you guys later. Bye.

05:16.401 --> 05:18.319
She said not to come,
it's going to be a while.

05:18.695 --> 05:20.947
Well, first deliveries can be slow.

05:21.572 --> 05:24.242
I am starting to rethink the Flash onesie
I bought this kid.

05:25.952 --> 05:27.620
I found it, but it's empty.

05:27.787 --> 05:29.622
Well, it doesn't matter,
we're not going to the hospital now.

05:29.831 --> 05:31.874
Are you sure?
I'd really like to.

05:34.293 --> 05:35.837
Well, should we, uh,

05:36.546 --> 05:37.797
head back up?

05:38.381 --> 05:40.842
Come on, guys. We're all awake.
Why don't we go to a diner or something?

05:41.217 --> 05:42.427
Oh, uh,

05:42.677 --> 05:45.430
I don't know. Sheldon,
you don't want to do that, do you?

05:46.014 --> 05:49.183
It doesn't matter what I want.
It's your birthday, you decide.

05:49.392 --> 05:52.228
Oh, my God. It's your birthday.
Let's do something fun.

05:52.437 --> 05:53.730
- Uh...
- Oh, we can go to a bar...

05:53.896 --> 05:55.106
Well...

05:56.149 --> 05:58.151
Okay, I can breathe again.
Babe, they want to have sex.

05:59.902 --> 06:04.032
Oh, of course.
The annual birthday booty spectacular.

06:05.116 --> 06:06.784
That's a bit childish, isn't it?

06:06.951 --> 06:09.746
I'm sorry, and what flavor
is your bubble gum cigar?

06:11.789 --> 06:13.583
Grape. I find it the most mild.

06:15.251 --> 06:17.462
All right. Well, you two go have fun.

06:21.257 --> 06:24.052
If we find my backup inhaler
maybe we can get frisky.

06:24.635 --> 06:27.930
Oh, you sexy, wheezy, little man.

06:31.142 --> 06:32.643
<i>Do you really need to record this?</i>

06:32.935 --> 06:34.979
<i>You'll be happy I did.</i>

06:35.813 --> 06:38.316
<i>OKay, little one, here we are</i>

06:38.483 --> 06:41.360
<i>back at home because you weren't
quite ready to come out yet.</i>

06:41.819 --> 06:44.822
<i>You wanted to make an entrance, I get it.</i>

06:46.157 --> 06:49.660
<i>And here's your daddy.</i>

06:50.036 --> 06:52.371
<i>When he tries to tell you
he used to be cool,</i>

06:52.538 --> 06:54.207
<i>you can see he wasn't.</i>

06:57.293 --> 06:58.836
<i>All right, enough with the camera.</i>

06:59.253 --> 07:01.380
What? This is not for me,
this is for the baby.

07:01.547 --> 07:03.257
Someday she's going to want to see this.

07:04.217 --> 07:05.510
I'm sorry.

07:06.135 --> 07:07.428
Who's going to want to see this?

07:09.931 --> 07:13.768
I said "she"
but lots of things are she.

07:14.227 --> 07:18.523
Boats, cars, whales. "Thar she blows!"

07:21.400 --> 07:22.777
You're doing great.

07:23.820 --> 07:24.821
Raj.

07:25.154 --> 07:26.948
Okay. Uh, I'm going to sign off now,

07:27.115 --> 07:29.367
<i>this next part may contain
some adult language.</i>

07:30.118 --> 07:31.119
How could you?

07:31.285 --> 07:34.122
We made it this far without knowing
and you ruined it.

07:34.288 --> 07:35.873
Well, you guys have no idea how hard it is

07:36.040 --> 07:37.875
to know something like this
and not say it.

07:38.876 --> 07:40.795
You told me it was a girl
and I didn't say it.

07:41.170 --> 07:42.171
Raj.

07:42.338 --> 07:44.048
You were supposed to
keep that to yourself.

07:44.715 --> 07:47.385
Oh, yeah. I guess it is hard.

07:52.557 --> 07:54.809
So, where were we?

07:55.977 --> 07:59.564
I believe we were kissing
like randy teenagers,

08:00.898 --> 08:03.651
and your nose
was whistling ever so slightly.

08:05.403 --> 08:07.071
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, don't be.

08:07.572 --> 08:09.532
You were like a foxy teakettle.

08:11.951 --> 08:14.495
Well, shall we start over?

08:15.413 --> 08:16.747
Very well.

08:23.212 --> 08:24.213
What's wrong?

08:24.839 --> 08:26.090
I'm not sure.

08:26.799 --> 08:30.511
Earlier tonight things began organically
and now it's feeling forced.

08:31.220 --> 08:33.389
Like all the
<i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> sequels.

08:36.767 --> 08:40.271
Okay, that makes sense.
I mean, the mood's a little different now.

08:40.855 --> 08:42.190
We don't have to rush.

08:42.356 --> 08:45.526
Oh, I know, but Leonard and Penny
think we're doing it.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.069
And I don't want to disappoint them.

08:50.489 --> 08:52.241
And the mood continues to change.

08:53.034 --> 08:55.244
No, and also
I don't want to disappoint you.

08:55.411 --> 08:58.831
You know, come on, it's your birthday,
I can soldier through this.

09:01.125 --> 09:02.418
Hold on.

09:03.044 --> 09:06.380
I think I might have a little surprise
that might help

09:06.797 --> 09:08.507
get things back on track.

09:10.009 --> 09:11.344
Intriguing.

09:11.552 --> 09:15.473
Is "back on track" a hint
that it has something to do with trains?

09:18.267 --> 09:19.310
No.

09:20.937 --> 09:22.230
Because if it did have to do with trains...

09:22.396 --> 09:23.439
<i>It's not about trains.</i>

09:26.108 --> 09:28.444
- Not even a cozy sleeper car...
<i>- Stop talking about trains!</i>

09:30.905 --> 09:32.323
Who's killing the mood now?

09:35.701 --> 09:37.495
Found the backup inhaler.
Want to have sex?

09:40.081 --> 09:41.999
Well, I didn't until I heard that.

09:43.084 --> 09:44.293
Hang on, I'm counting.

09:46.254 --> 09:47.255
It's okay.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.927
<i>Hello,</i>

09:53.135 --> 09:57.014
<i>Howard and Bernadette kicked me out
because I told them they're having a girl.</i>

09:57.765 --> 10:00.017
<i>Oopsie, I did it again.</i>

10:02.520 --> 10:04.021
Maybe, if we're quiet, he'll go away.

10:04.772 --> 10:07.692
<i>You're going to have
to be quieter than that.</i>

10:09.986 --> 10:11.153
Can I look yet?

10:11.320 --> 10:12.571
<i>One second.</i>

10:14.365 --> 10:16.033
<i>All right, you can open your eyes.</i>

10:22.164 --> 10:25.543
I thought I'd let Harry Potter
make things hotter.

10:29.922 --> 10:31.090
Wowza.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.678
I got a Gryffindor robe for you.

10:37.305 --> 10:39.890
A Gryffindor sleeping with a Hufflepuff?

10:41.225 --> 10:42.852
How scandalous.

10:45.730 --> 10:47.565
You naughty girl.

10:48.649 --> 10:51.402
You went to the Wizarding World theme park
without me.

10:52.820 --> 10:55.614
I did, am I in trouble?

10:57.616 --> 11:00.619
Yes, you're in trouble.
You went to Wizarding World without me.

11:01.746 --> 11:03.331
Wait, wait, wait. What just happened?

11:03.706 --> 11:05.583
You know I've been wanting to go.

11:06.083 --> 11:09.295
Sheldon, do you really want to
argue with me on my birthday?

11:10.921 --> 11:13.424
Um, you're right. I'm sorry.

11:16.135 --> 11:18.554
Ooh, happy birthday to me.

11:22.767 --> 11:25.394
<i>Hello.</i>

11:28.689 --> 11:29.982
Is this about the baby?

11:30.608 --> 11:33.277
No, people just keep kicking me out
everywhere I go.

11:33.444 --> 11:34.695
Good, then you're used to this.

11:36.947 --> 11:39.950
- Hey, Bernadette's water broke!
- Come on, everyone to the hospital!

11:40.117 --> 11:41.952
<i>You have got to be kidding me!</i>

11:48.292 --> 11:50.544
Just try to relax,
we'll be there any minute.

11:51.295 --> 11:53.964
Stuart, stop driving like an old man,
speed it up a little.

11:54.131 --> 11:55.549
I'm not an old man.

11:55.925 --> 11:57.468
I just can't see at night.

11:59.136 --> 12:00.638
Here comes another one.

12:00.805 --> 12:03.516
Hey, squinty,
the gas pedal's on the right!

12:04.350 --> 12:05.684
All right, hang on.

12:05.935 --> 12:07.978
If you see any pedestrians
just call 'em out.

12:12.358 --> 12:14.652
Howard and Bernadette's kid
might be born on your birthday.

12:14.819 --> 12:15.986
How cool is that?

12:16.362 --> 12:19.990
Yeah. But I thought this baby was supposed
to ruin their sex life, not mine.

12:21.617 --> 12:24.954
This is not how I imagined this day going.
I should be with them right now.

12:25.121 --> 12:26.831
Well, it is their child.

12:26.997 --> 12:28.666
I know that. But, to be fair,

12:28.833 --> 12:32.086
I've spent nine months helping Bernadette
get ready for this baby.

12:32.670 --> 12:34.505
Howard spent five minutes conceiving it,

12:35.506 --> 12:36.841
and I'm being generous.

12:38.717 --> 12:39.969
Five minutes?

12:40.636 --> 12:43.013
Oh, we must be doing it wrong.
Took us hours.

12:48.269 --> 12:52.022
And the worst part is that
they kicked me out and let Stuart stay.

12:52.731 --> 12:55.568
I understand, but this is a special day
for them.

12:55.734 --> 12:56.902
Can you just try and let it go?

12:57.445 --> 12:58.529
She's right.

12:58.737 --> 13:01.574
Now, I just learned
Amy went to a theme park without me,

13:01.824 --> 13:03.492
but I'm not going to ruin her birthday.

13:03.701 --> 13:07.913
I'll wait and ruin 24 individual hours
sprinkled throughout the year.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.334
Boop.

13:16.422 --> 13:18.549
Deep breaths, slow breaths.

13:19.508 --> 13:21.677
I'm so thirsty. Give me more ice chips.

13:27.933 --> 13:29.268
Sorry.

13:29.602 --> 13:31.228
I thought these were room ice chips.

13:33.230 --> 13:34.440
I'll go get some more.

13:34.732 --> 13:37.234
Uh, Stuart, while you're out there,
don't come back.

13:42.781 --> 13:45.493
So, what are we going to name this kid?

13:46.535 --> 13:48.412
Now that we know she's a girl,

13:48.579 --> 13:51.457
it kind of ruins my plan
for Wally Wolowitz.

13:53.501 --> 13:55.127
We could name her after your mom.

13:55.628 --> 13:56.921
Debbie?

13:57.296 --> 13:59.381
No, she hated that name.

14:00.049 --> 14:01.133
Did she have a middle name?

14:01.300 --> 14:02.468
Melvina.

14:04.595 --> 14:05.930
Let's keep thinking.

14:10.226 --> 14:12.353
It sucks that she's not here.

14:13.562 --> 14:14.772
I know.

14:15.898 --> 14:17.525
She would've been the best grandma.

14:19.109 --> 14:20.819
She did always have candy in her pocket.

14:20.986 --> 14:23.364
Yeah. I was

14:23.948 --> 14:28.035
twenty years old before I figured out
Tootsie Rolls weren't naturally warm.

14:30.454 --> 14:32.456
I didn't know her five minutes
and she asked

14:32.831 --> 14:35.918
"Are you a Milky Way or a Snickers girl?"

14:37.920 --> 14:40.130
Thank God you answered right,
we wouldn't be here today.

14:43.342 --> 14:44.969
It's hard to believe
Howard's having a kid.

14:45.135 --> 14:46.136
Yeah.

14:46.345 --> 14:48.097
Penny, you're the one
who introduced him to Bernie.

14:48.264 --> 14:50.140
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?

14:52.101 --> 14:53.978
And it's not just Howard and Bernadette.

14:54.603 --> 14:55.980
Look how far we've all come.

14:57.106 --> 14:58.649
You two got married.

14:58.816 --> 15:00.317
Sheldon and I are living together.

15:00.776 --> 15:02.820
But if my mom asks, we have bunk beds.

15:05.239 --> 15:08.325
Penny was a struggling actress when we met
and now she's

15:08.534 --> 15:10.452
a successful pharmaceutical rep.

15:10.619 --> 15:13.497
You don't have to say <i>struggling</i>
every time, you can just say actress.

15:15.291 --> 15:16.667
Howard went to space.

15:16.834 --> 15:18.335
Bernadette got her doctorate.

15:18.502 --> 15:22.506
Sheldon, Howard, and I are working with
the government on our quantum gyroscope.

15:23.299 --> 15:24.883
We have all come a long way.

15:25.050 --> 15:26.468
There's a lot to be proud of.

15:27.928 --> 15:31.473
For God's sake, just drive in the knife,
why don't you?

15:33.809 --> 15:35.978
- What's your problem?
- You're all thinking it.

15:36.145 --> 15:38.689
I'm the only one who hasn't done
anything worthwhile.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.399
I was not thinking it.

15:40.649 --> 15:42.985
Although, now that you've point it out,
it is undeniable.

15:45.029 --> 15:46.655
Raj, if it's any consolation,

15:46.864 --> 15:49.074
I'm no better off
than I was 10 years ago.

15:49.825 --> 15:51.660
Oh, yay.

15:52.870 --> 15:55.873
I have a doctorate in astrophysics
and I'm every bit as awesome

15:56.040 --> 15:58.208
as the pasty-faced owner
of a comic book store.

15:58.375 --> 16:01.211
Raj, show some compassion.

16:01.462 --> 16:03.881
Those are things that we think
but don't say.

16:08.552 --> 16:09.887
Excuse me.

16:11.138 --> 16:12.222
Sorry, Stuart.

16:12.473 --> 16:14.642
Hey, I'm in a hospital
and I'm not the patient,

16:14.975 --> 16:16.101
I'm fine.

16:18.187 --> 16:19.730
Come on, Bernie. Breathe.

16:19.897 --> 16:21.565
Remember what you learned
in birthing class.

16:21.732 --> 16:24.610
I remember thinking "This is stupid,"
and I was right.

16:26.695 --> 16:27.946
Do you want me to get the nurse?

16:28.155 --> 16:30.949
No. If one more person puts
their fingers near my uterus

16:31.158 --> 16:33.202
I'm going to cross my legs
and snap 'em off.

16:38.582 --> 16:40.959
I've come to peace with my relationship
with my parents.

16:41.168 --> 16:43.003
That was a big milestone for me.

16:43.420 --> 16:45.214
Oh, speaking of personal growth.

16:45.422 --> 16:47.883
I recently tried eating Swiss chard.

16:50.719 --> 16:53.180
Now, I didn't swallow it,
but Amy said it counted.

16:56.392 --> 16:58.310
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:02.356 --> 17:05.442
You still a loser or did you
turn things around while you were gone?

17:08.237 --> 17:10.572
You know, Raj, honey,
you're being too hard on yourself.

17:10.739 --> 17:12.658
When I first met you,
you couldn't even talk to women.

17:12.950 --> 17:14.993
You couldn't even talk
if one was in the room.

17:15.285 --> 17:16.704
Great, now I can say things like,

17:16.870 --> 17:18.622
"I can't believe
you're breaking up with me.

17:19.289 --> 17:20.833
"Why are you breaking up with me?

17:21.959 --> 17:23.419
"Yes, I'll still help you move."

17:25.963 --> 17:27.339
Anyone else want to try?

17:27.965 --> 17:29.633
Uh, yeah. I got something.

17:30.467 --> 17:33.262
Raj, not everybody can be a dog owner.

17:35.931 --> 17:38.726
Oh, what, did your doggie
break up with you, too?

17:41.186 --> 17:44.773
Hey, I bought M&M's at the vending machine
and two bags came out.

17:45.274 --> 17:47.234
I bought the first one, it didn't fall.

17:48.861 --> 17:49.987
Here.

17:54.825 --> 17:56.452
She's here, the baby's here.

17:56.660 --> 17:58.370
Congratulations.

17:58.704 --> 18:01.874
- How's Bernadette?
- Tired, but great. They're both great.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.417
Does the baby have a name yet?

18:03.834 --> 18:06.712
- We have named her Halley.
- Aw.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.881
- Like Halley's comet.
- Exactly.

18:09.047 --> 18:10.674
Also like the comet, Bernadette said

18:10.841 --> 18:13.093
she's not going to have sex with me
for another 75 years.

18:14.595 --> 18:16.555
That's not a real thing. He's just joking.

18:18.015 --> 18:20.184
I'm going to get back.
Thank you for staying up.

18:20.392 --> 18:23.187
I can't wait for Halley to meet her
new aunts and uncles

18:23.562 --> 18:24.897
and godfather.

18:26.106 --> 18:28.066
- Really?
- Of course.

18:29.526 --> 18:33.363
You hear that, Stuart? I've got a dog
and a godchild, you have nothing!

18:40.454 --> 18:42.581
Oh, look at all the babies.

18:43.707 --> 18:45.501
Some will be successful.

18:45.667 --> 18:47.085
Some may be homeless.

18:50.047 --> 18:51.590
It's fun to think about.

18:54.635 --> 18:56.178
I wonder which one's Halley.

18:56.428 --> 18:57.888
It's kind of hard to see the names.

18:58.347 --> 19:00.057
Mmm. That one kind of
looks like Bernadette.

19:00.557 --> 19:01.892
They all look the same to me.

19:02.351 --> 19:06.897
Guys, she's my goddaughter.
I think I'll know when I see her.

19:17.491 --> 19:18.617
That one.

19:25.874 --> 19:28.252
- Well, that was quite a day.
- It was.

19:29.294 --> 19:32.714
Bernadette had her baby,
I made it to Wizarding World,

19:32.965 --> 19:36.260
and now it is time
to complete your birthday celebration.

19:36.844 --> 19:38.679
Hankius-Pankius.

19:41.807 --> 19:43.767
I was afraid you'd be too tired.

19:44.268 --> 19:47.271
Amy, I just saw a magic train

19:47.479 --> 19:49.898
and reported somebody
for cutting the line.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.486
If that's not foreplay,
I don't know what is.

20:27.269 --> 20:28.270
English - SDH
