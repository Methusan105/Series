WEBVTT

00:04.798 --> 00:10.095
Okay, I'm zeroing out the electro-osmotic
flow rate in the micro-fluidic channel.

00:10.804 --> 00:12.263
Nicely done, Howard.

00:12.430 --> 00:14.933
Well, my wife
is four-foot-ten and sexually satisfied,

00:15.100 --> 00:17.435
so clearly I know my way
around tiny things.

00:18.436 --> 00:21.106
Good for you.
On the cutting edge of new technology,

00:21.272 --> 00:24.693
and still making inappropriate comments
about the mother of your child.

00:25.902 --> 00:28.113
Those are just the things I say out loud.

00:28.947 --> 00:30.949
Gentlemen, we need to stop immediately.

00:31.491 --> 00:33.159
- What's wrong?
- I'm looking at the math,

00:33.326 --> 00:37.706
and I think we can make the device
between eight and 10% smaller.

00:38.373 --> 00:41.710
That's great, but the Air Force
approved the specs. We're good to go.

00:41.876 --> 00:43.294
Yeah, it doesn't need to be smaller.

00:43.878 --> 00:45.088
Shame on you.

00:46.506 --> 00:49.300
Where would we be
if poodle breeders had that attitude?

00:50.593 --> 00:53.138
I'll tell you. We'd have the standard
and the miniature poodle,

00:53.304 --> 00:54.347
but no toy or teacup.

00:55.890 --> 00:57.976
Which, by the way,
is not an officially recognized breed,

00:58.143 --> 00:59.686
but that's just poodle politics.

01:00.854 --> 01:02.605
Can we please stop talking about poodles?

01:03.106 --> 01:05.066
Fine. Candy bars.

01:05.358 --> 01:07.944
Now do you enjoy a fun size?
I know you do.

01:08.820 --> 01:10.155
Sheldon, we don't need
to make this smaller.

01:10.321 --> 01:11.948
Your work is done. Go home.

01:12.699 --> 01:13.908
I don't wanna go home.

01:14.075 --> 01:16.494
- Fine, go for a little walk.
- Then what?

01:16.745 --> 01:18.329
Just keep walking.

01:45.982 --> 01:48.443
At least it's quiet
when he takes bathroom breaks.

01:49.819 --> 01:50.862
I know.

01:51.237 --> 01:54.157
That's why I keep refilling his water
when he's not looking.

01:55.366 --> 01:56.534
You're kidding.

01:57.035 --> 01:58.953
I don't care if we're in a drought,
it's worth it.

02:01.664 --> 02:05.210
You know, I... I do have a way
to get him out of our hair.

02:06.044 --> 02:07.796
I've been holding on to this
for a few years,

02:07.962 --> 02:09.339
but maybe now's the time.

02:09.881 --> 02:12.550
We can just lock the door,
you don't have to kill him.

02:14.052 --> 02:17.055
You can't kill him,
he'll just respawn at the last save point.

02:19.015 --> 02:21.935
Oh.
That was my sixth trip to the bathroom.

02:22.602 --> 02:24.729
As long as it's not
a urinary tract infection,

02:24.896 --> 02:26.439
that's a personal best.

02:27.273 --> 02:29.484
Hey, uh, buddy,
I got you a little present.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.320
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah. Go ahead, open it.

02:35.865 --> 02:39.285
"Congratulations. The bearer
of this certificate

02:39.452 --> 02:43.456
"is entitled
to the ultimate train experience

02:43.915 --> 02:46.209
"at The Nevada Northern Railway.

02:46.376 --> 02:50.964
"You are at the throttle.
You are the engineer.

02:51.130 --> 02:54.425
"You are running the locomotive."

02:57.595 --> 03:00.682
This doesn't happen very often,
but here comes a hug.

03:04.978 --> 03:07.105
Oh, dear! I have to tinkle again.

03:12.652 --> 03:14.070
Okay, where were we?

03:17.282 --> 03:20.493
For Howie's occupation,
should I include that he was an astronaut?

03:20.827 --> 03:22.370
Well, he mentioned it
in his mother's eulogy,

03:22.537 --> 03:23.538
so why not?

03:24.998 --> 03:27.876
I can't believe you have to fill out
a preschool application for an infant.

03:28.042 --> 03:29.961
Uh, the one at Caltech
has a crazy wait list.

03:30.128 --> 03:32.755
I warned you, a lot of people apply
when they're still pregnant.

03:32.922 --> 03:34.048
Well, I didn't.

03:34.215 --> 03:37.468
I also skipped a birthing class
to see <i>Zootopia</i>, so back off.

03:38.303 --> 03:39.512
Whoa, just trying to help.

03:40.138 --> 03:42.974
Sorry. Howie's back at work
and there's just so much going on.

03:43.433 --> 03:44.642
Is there anything we can do?

03:45.018 --> 03:48.021
Sure. Open up a college fund,
shop for life insurance

03:48.187 --> 03:50.607
and in the laundry room,
there's a mountain of dirty laundry.

03:50.857 --> 03:52.567
Wash it or burn it. Your choice.

03:55.862 --> 03:58.489
- Be right back.
- No, no. I will take care of it.

03:58.656 --> 03:59.657
Thank you.

03:59.824 --> 04:02.744
While I'm gone, you can think about
how mean you were to me.

04:04.162 --> 04:06.831
All right, you know what you need?
A night away from all of this.

04:06.998 --> 04:09.375
You know, where you can
just kind of relax and...

04:09.709 --> 04:12.879
Okay, I'm just gonna turn this off.

04:17.842 --> 04:19.844
Much better.

04:20.303 --> 04:23.514
Seriously, let's plan a night, you know,
give you a break. We could go dancing.

04:24.182 --> 04:25.600
That sounds really nice.

04:26.059 --> 04:29.020
Oh. All this week,
the Early Music Society of Pasadena

04:29.187 --> 04:32.357
is doing a joint concert
with the San Gabriel Renaissance Choir.

04:34.192 --> 04:36.110
Okay, that's the one to beat.

04:37.487 --> 04:40.198
Good luck. People have been saying that
for 600 years.

04:45.703 --> 04:46.788
Hey. You're home early.

04:47.747 --> 04:50.792
You'll never believe it.
Leonard gave me the most incredible gift.

04:50.959 --> 04:53.670
A trip to a historic railway

04:53.836 --> 04:56.297
and I get to operate an actual locomotive.

04:57.006 --> 04:59.926
Wow. He finally used it? What'd you do?

05:02.053 --> 05:03.972
No idea. All I know is

05:04.138 --> 05:07.016
I'm gonna be working on the railroad
all the livelong day.

05:08.267 --> 05:09.644
Well, I'm really happy for you.

05:09.811 --> 05:11.396
Oh, no, it's not just me.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.815
The railway is four hours
from the nearest airport,

05:13.982 --> 05:15.566
and guess who gets to drive me?

05:16.234 --> 05:17.652
- I give up.
- You!

05:17.819 --> 05:19.570
No, I really give up.

05:20.989 --> 05:22.657
Oh, oh. And guess where we get to sleep.

05:22.824 --> 05:25.410
Our choice of a turn-of-the-century
railway bunkhouse

05:25.576 --> 05:27.620
or a working caboose!

05:27.787 --> 05:30.373
Now, the problem with the caboose
is there's no bathroom.

05:30.540 --> 05:33.418
But the problem with the bunkhouse
is it's not a caboose.

05:35.294 --> 05:37.964
On the first day,
I get to drive a steam engine.

05:38.756 --> 05:40.883
On the second day, a diesel engine.

05:41.968 --> 05:44.846
Oh, and if I volunteer to do
track maintenance and paperwork,

05:45.013 --> 05:46.597
they'll let me stay as long as I want.

05:47.598 --> 05:50.476
You might want to pack enough clothes
for the rest of our lives.

05:52.353 --> 05:53.855
Can I pee now?

05:55.148 --> 05:56.441
Oh, get this.

05:58.276 --> 06:02.405
I get to take a test
based on 125-page manual.

06:02.572 --> 06:04.574
I get to learn things like hand signals.

06:04.741 --> 06:09.746
Whoa, there's forward, reverse,
set the brakes.

06:10.621 --> 06:13.583
Are you done yet?
You're missing some great stuff out here.

06:14.834 --> 06:16.461
Oh, this is good.

06:18.212 --> 06:22.175
There are dozens of railroad crossings
you have to blow the whistle for.

06:22.341 --> 06:24.802
That is the figurative "you,"
not the literal "you."

06:24.969 --> 06:26.471
I'll be blowing the whistle.

06:27.972 --> 06:29.974
Amy, get up. It's time to go to work.

06:33.978 --> 06:36.105
This train thing worked out
better than I thought.

06:36.272 --> 06:38.858
He's home studying the engineer's manual.

06:39.984 --> 06:43.654
It's so peaceful without him here.
Can I ask you how much that cost?

06:43.821 --> 06:45.990
Four thousand dollars, worth every penny.

06:47.492 --> 06:48.493
Gentlemen.

06:48.701 --> 06:49.702
- Oh, sir.
- Colonel Williams.

06:49.952 --> 06:51.996
Just wanted to see
how the guidance system's coming along.

06:52.163 --> 06:53.790
Great. We found a cooling solution

06:53.956 --> 06:57.085
that allowed us to get the size
of the prototype down to the target specs.

06:57.543 --> 07:00.671
As a cooling solution, it's pretty <i>cool.</i>

07:01.964 --> 07:02.965
Don't do that.

07:05.676 --> 07:06.677
What's this?

07:07.011 --> 07:08.721
Oh, nothing. Just some math we don't need.

07:09.013 --> 07:10.348
This is a different approach.

07:10.515 --> 07:12.934
Are you trying to get the guidance system
even smaller?

07:13.142 --> 07:16.687
It's just a theory.
It's not even worked out.

07:17.146 --> 07:18.356
Oh.

07:19.190 --> 07:20.358
I want this.

07:22.151 --> 07:24.695
But we've already met
the agreed-upon specs.

07:24.862 --> 07:28.533
Going smaller would require
weeks' worth of new computations.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.369
So get the kid with the two shirts
to do it.

07:33.371 --> 07:35.540
Sir, if I may,

07:35.706 --> 07:39.210
we've put a lot of thought and effort
into this current prototype.

07:39.377 --> 07:42.797
It's a really elegant solution
and most importantly, it works.

07:44.048 --> 07:45.299
Yeah, I want this.

07:47.343 --> 07:48.386
Okay, but that's just a theory.

07:48.553 --> 07:50.054
It's not even a complete thought.

07:50.263 --> 07:51.722
You both make excellent points.

07:51.889 --> 07:54.475
Thank you for presenting it
so articulately.

07:54.642 --> 07:55.643
Make this.

08:01.023 --> 08:02.817
The kid with the two shirts
screwed us again.

08:06.863 --> 08:08.739
All right. You guys ready to get crazy?

08:09.073 --> 08:11.284
Well, the bra under here ain't beige.

08:12.785 --> 08:15.454
Okay. You ladies have fun tonight.

08:15.621 --> 08:17.915
Don't worry about Halley.
Uncle Stuart's on the job.

08:18.124 --> 08:21.127
Oh, under the careful supervision
of her godfather.

08:21.502 --> 08:24.589
My apologies.
Didn't mean to offend you, Don Corleone.

08:25.715 --> 08:27.383
Like I said, you ladies have fun.

08:27.550 --> 08:30.595
We will. Got my dancing shoes,
got my breast pump. Let's party.

08:32.263 --> 08:35.224
You know, if you pump at the bar,
I promise we'll get free drinks.

08:35.933 --> 08:37.185
Call if there's any problems.

08:37.351 --> 08:39.604
- No. She's busy, you call Howard.
- Uh, got it.

08:40.438 --> 08:41.981
Call me, don't call Howard.

08:42.481 --> 08:44.150
Hey, I would never call Howard.

08:46.611 --> 08:48.529
Okay, instead of arguing all night,

08:48.696 --> 08:50.448
let's just split up the baby chores.

08:50.656 --> 08:52.867
Yeah, great.
Um, I'll put food in her top half,

08:53.034 --> 08:54.952
you deal with
whatever comes out the bottom.

08:59.457 --> 09:02.335
I can't believe we have to ask
Sheldon to come back and help us.

09:02.501 --> 09:06.464
Oh, boo-hoo. I spent four grand on a gift
that only got rid of him for an afternoon.

09:14.972 --> 09:16.140
What is that?

09:16.307 --> 09:18.976
I don't know,
but if he yells, "It's alive!" we run.

09:27.485 --> 09:28.486
Oh, hey.

09:28.653 --> 09:31.864
If you knocked I couldn't hear you.
I'm welding this locomotive engine.

09:34.075 --> 09:36.786
And if you didn't knock,
how about some manners?

09:38.663 --> 09:40.665
How'd you even get that up the stairs?

09:40.831 --> 09:43.668
I said to myself,
"I think I can, I think I can."

09:46.170 --> 09:48.047
And then I couldn't.

09:48.506 --> 09:51.342
So I paid two men
who promised not to come rob us later.

09:52.218 --> 09:55.930
Okay, look, Sheldon, the Colonel wants us
to make the guidance system smaller

09:56.097 --> 09:57.765
and we can't do it without you.

09:58.391 --> 09:59.642
Interesting.

10:00.309 --> 10:01.519
Well, so I was right.

10:01.686 --> 10:04.313
Open a window,
it's about to get smug in here.

10:06.274 --> 10:09.694
Well, I would love to help you,
but since I discovered the satisfaction

10:09.860 --> 10:12.113
of working with my hands
on a train engine,

10:12.571 --> 10:14.073
I don't think I can go back to theory.

10:15.074 --> 10:16.784
I'm an engineer now.

10:18.411 --> 10:21.580
And, hey, just to be clear,
a train engineer.

10:23.249 --> 10:25.001
Not that goofy kind you are.

10:32.591 --> 10:35.011
Sheldon, you can still go
on the trip in a few weeks.

10:35.177 --> 10:36.262
Just help us out.

10:36.429 --> 10:38.055
Sorry, I need to work on this engine,

10:38.222 --> 10:40.725
so when I get to the train yard,
I won't look foolish.

10:42.059 --> 10:44.061
He's worried about looking foolish.

10:44.228 --> 10:46.564
That's a heaping helping
of irony right there.

10:48.274 --> 10:49.984
Come on, you know
you're not leaving physics.

10:50.151 --> 10:51.152
Why are you doing this?

10:52.236 --> 10:56.824
Leonard, in the world
of theoretical physics, you never finish.

10:56.991 --> 10:58.284
So much is unprovable.

10:58.743 --> 11:00.745
But when I was studying
that railway guide,

11:00.911 --> 11:04.498
it was so tangible and so satisfying,

11:04.665 --> 11:06.167
that something just clicked.

11:06.334 --> 11:07.668
Then it clacked.

11:09.170 --> 11:11.005
Then it clicked,
then it clacked, click-clack,

11:11.172 --> 11:12.757
clickety-clack and here we are.

11:13.049 --> 11:14.508
Whoo-whoo!

11:18.429 --> 11:20.556
Hey. Did you hear anything back
from the Caltech preschool?

11:21.098 --> 11:23.142
Not yet, but we're gonna apply
to a bunch of others

11:23.309 --> 11:24.518
just to keep our options open.

11:24.685 --> 11:27.646
Okay. Stop that! No more preschool talk.
Tonight is about having fun.

11:28.773 --> 11:30.649
Nothing says fun like being scolded.

11:33.611 --> 11:36.572
Uh-oh, it's Raj. Everything okay?

11:36.822 --> 11:39.450
Don't worry, everything's fine.

11:40.534 --> 11:42.453
Hang up, we don't need help.

11:42.620 --> 11:44.830
I don't need your help
deciding when we need help.

11:46.916 --> 11:48.376
Raj, what's going on?

11:49.460 --> 11:52.254
So, I was just warming up
some milk for Halley,

11:52.421 --> 11:54.382
and I thought the milk smelled
a little funky,

11:54.548 --> 11:58.636
so I checked the date that you wrote
on the bottle and it says "Flerbsday."

11:59.595 --> 12:00.930
It says Tuesday.

12:01.138 --> 12:02.640
How is that a "T"?

12:04.809 --> 12:08.062
I'm sure it's fine, but if you're worried
there's extra milk in the freezer.

12:08.312 --> 12:09.313
<i>OKay, yes.</i>

12:09.480 --> 12:13.818
I will err on the side of caution
and defrost a fresh batch.

12:14.068 --> 12:15.569
You're wasting perfectly good milk.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.696
- Fine, you drink it.
- It's just milk.

12:17.863 --> 12:19.573
Stuart, don't you drink my milk!

12:21.534 --> 12:24.537
Okay. Can you guys handle this or not?

12:24.745 --> 12:28.332
Oh, of course we can.
Uh, you girls have a good time.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.085
She said I was in charge.

12:34.713 --> 12:36.924
So we just throw this away?

12:37.091 --> 12:38.843
What else are you gonna do with it,
put it in your coffee?

12:39.135 --> 12:40.678
Well, I don't take it black.

12:44.807 --> 12:47.685
Okay, this is everything he had
on the board.

12:47.852 --> 12:50.521
- I'm sure we can figure the rest out.
- All right.

12:51.605 --> 12:52.606
Hmm.

12:55.943 --> 12:58.154
Feel free to jump in. "Hmm" is all I got.

12:59.572 --> 13:01.323
We can get this.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.327
Is there any chance it's upside down?

13:07.872 --> 13:10.207
Maybe we can find
another theoretical physicist to help us.

13:10.416 --> 13:13.252
It's classified.
If we tell anyone we'd get in trouble.

13:13.419 --> 13:15.880
Hey, I came up with that and "hmm."
You haven't pitched anything.

13:16.714 --> 13:17.840
Just keep thinking.

13:21.594 --> 13:22.595
I got it.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.225
You really figured it out?

13:28.893 --> 13:30.102
No.

13:30.269 --> 13:32.563
But when we show this nonsense
to Sheldon,

13:32.730 --> 13:35.191
it will make him crazy
and he'll have to fix it.

13:36.734 --> 13:39.653
- Oh, you're a genius.
- Yeah, I know.

13:39.820 --> 13:42.907
Uh, that's not even a math symbol,
that's just Charlie Brown's hair.

13:47.369 --> 13:49.580
Sorry, guys. This club was so great.

13:49.747 --> 13:51.081
How could they turn it into a bookstore?

13:51.582 --> 13:53.417
I thought we got rid of all those.

13:55.127 --> 13:57.838
Renaissance choir's looking
pretty good right now, huh?

14:00.716 --> 14:01.800
Hello?

14:02.259 --> 14:04.470
Nothing to worry about.

14:04.762 --> 14:06.597
She's just been crying for a little while,

14:06.764 --> 14:09.517
and I was wondering
if you had any tricks to get her to sleep.

14:09.683 --> 14:12.770
She was sleeping just fine
until you took a selfie with her.

14:13.729 --> 14:16.106
She was blowing a spit bubble.
It was adorable!

14:18.609 --> 14:20.361
You guys got this?
Do you need me to come home?

14:21.570 --> 14:23.864
Wait, wait. She's settling down.

14:24.198 --> 14:26.116
Oh, okay, false alarm.

14:26.408 --> 14:28.994
Little parenting tip,
sleeping babies hate flash photography.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.666
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

14:33.832 --> 14:37.461
I may have just left my infant daughter
with Patrick and SpongeBob.

14:39.964 --> 14:41.840
Hey, there's another dance club nearby.

14:42.007 --> 14:44.843
I mean, I don't know how you feel
about Latin music,

14:45.010 --> 14:47.888
but according to their <i>horas of operacion,</i>
they're open.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.058
Maybe we should just call it a night.

14:51.308 --> 14:53.018
You sure? They're open till <i>dos.</i>

14:54.895 --> 14:56.730
Yeah, we're all dressed up, why go home?

14:56.897 --> 14:58.899
I'm just not really in the mood anymore.

14:59.233 --> 15:00.276
What's going on with you?

15:00.568 --> 15:04.196
I don't know, this is all starting to feel
like a sad attempt to recapture our youth.

15:04.655 --> 15:08.117
I'm not sad. I just wanted to get drunk
and not wear sweatpants.

15:09.994 --> 15:12.871
I'm not sad. I mean, hello.

15:15.833 --> 15:17.209
Okay, well, maybe I'm the one who's sad.

15:17.376 --> 15:18.669
What are you sad about?

15:19.503 --> 15:21.630
Maybe the fact
that you went and had a baby.

15:22.214 --> 15:23.424
You're upset I had a baby?

15:23.591 --> 15:25.342
No, of course not. I just...

15:25.509 --> 15:27.469
I didn't think it would make me
have all these feelings.

15:28.053 --> 15:29.054
What feelings?

15:29.263 --> 15:30.347
Pressure!

15:30.514 --> 15:33.726
I mean, she's looking at preschools,
she has a minivan, she has a 401.

15:34.184 --> 15:36.854
Before she talked about it,
I just thought that was a race.

15:37.980 --> 15:41.150
You think that stuff is fun?
Being a parent is terrifying.

15:41.734 --> 15:45.237
I'm constantly worried, I'm always tired,
and, in a few minutes,

15:45.404 --> 15:47.948
I'm going to milk myself
in a bookstore parking lot.

15:49.742 --> 15:50.909
I get that, okay?

15:51.076 --> 15:52.786
It's just, Leonard and I
have been married for two years

15:52.953 --> 15:55.456
and we're no further along
than when we were dating.

15:55.623 --> 15:57.374
Come on.
You've got so much to feel good about.

15:57.541 --> 15:58.876
You've got a great job now.

15:59.543 --> 16:01.545
Yeah, I guess. I am making decent money.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.213
You make more than I do.

16:03.505 --> 16:05.966
You may not have a house yet,
but your apartment's great.

16:06.508 --> 16:07.801
It's bigger than mine.

16:08.218 --> 16:10.054
And Leonard loves you so much,
he married you twice.

16:10.763 --> 16:12.723
I'm not even engaged once.

16:13.724 --> 16:16.060
I don't even know
if Sheldon thinks about marriage.

16:16.226 --> 16:17.770
Not gettin' any younger.

16:18.228 --> 16:20.939
Honestly, I kind of thought by now
we might have had some sort of...

16:21.106 --> 16:23.734
Careful. The sound of crying
can make me lactate.

16:25.277 --> 16:27.154
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

16:27.613 --> 16:30.491
Aw, that's gonna make me cry.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.243
And there they go.

16:35.954 --> 16:36.955
Ew.

16:41.835 --> 16:44.838
Well, Sheldon,
turns out we didn't need you after all.

16:45.005 --> 16:48.342
That's right, we figured it out
all by ourselves.

16:48.759 --> 16:50.761
- Wasn't even that hard.
- No.

16:51.053 --> 16:52.429
Oh, good for you, guys.

16:52.596 --> 16:55.724
Look, I have grease smudge on my hand
and I'm okay with it.

16:57.643 --> 16:59.978
Aren't you gonna look at the board
to see how right we are?

17:00.145 --> 17:02.856
No, thanks,
I'm busy trying to fix this fuel pump.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.358
It's a manifold.

17:05.150 --> 17:06.151
Oh.

17:06.402 --> 17:07.528
Well, I guess it's fixed.

17:09.279 --> 17:11.949
- Just look at the board.
- That's wrong.

17:12.700 --> 17:14.451
Oh, no.

17:17.162 --> 17:19.498
What should we have done differently?

17:20.457 --> 17:21.500
Well, first of all,

17:21.667 --> 17:24.169
you can't use relativistic
and non-relativistic vectors

17:24.336 --> 17:25.337
in the same equation.

17:25.504 --> 17:27.131
Told you.

17:28.799 --> 17:30.008
Can you fix it for us?

17:31.677 --> 17:33.887
Okay, but this is the last time.

17:50.404 --> 17:51.864
Nice try, blockheads.

17:54.783 --> 17:57.161
Come on, Sheldon,
you can't turn your back on physics.

17:57.327 --> 17:59.288
Besides, you have no idea
what you're doing with this stuff.

17:59.455 --> 18:01.165
But if you really want to learn
the mechanical side,

18:01.331 --> 18:02.666
I can teach you anything you wanna know.

18:02.833 --> 18:04.918
And instead of standing around watching,

18:05.085 --> 18:07.045
you can help us build
your smaller guidance system.

18:07.212 --> 18:10.132
And with all these new skills,
you'd be able to fix any model train.

18:10.299 --> 18:12.342
You'd be the king of the train store.

18:13.343 --> 18:16.638
Excuse me, I have a girlfriend.
I'm already king of the train store.

18:19.475 --> 18:20.684
So what do you say?

18:21.351 --> 18:23.103
Oh, what choice do I have? You need me.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.773
I'm like the crankshaft of this team.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.316
That's a turbo.

18:28.859 --> 18:29.860
Well, whatever it is, it looks heavy.

18:30.068 --> 18:32.321
I'm gonna need you two to get it
downstairs before Amy comes home.

18:51.757 --> 18:54.343
I apologize it is so warm in here.

18:54.885 --> 18:56.428
It is warm in here.

19:02.935 --> 19:05.187
I've worked up a bit of a sweat.

19:06.897 --> 19:08.232
Me, too.

19:11.652 --> 19:13.237
May I borrow your water?

19:37.052 --> 19:38.095
<i>The light's green.</i>

19:42.724 --> 19:43.851
Sorry.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.770
GPS says we'll be at the railway
in three hours.

19:47.229 --> 19:48.772
I can get us there in two.

20:18.135 --> 20:19.136
English - SDH
