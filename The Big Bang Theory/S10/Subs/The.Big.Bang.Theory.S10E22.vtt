WEBVTT

00:03.755 --> 00:05.423
- We're pinned down!
- We can't get through!

00:05.590 --> 00:07.092
Sheldon, get over here and help!

00:07.258 --> 00:08.468
Okay, one second.

00:11.346 --> 00:13.139
Sheldon, why are you jumping up and down?

00:13.306 --> 00:14.516
I'm trying to shoot!

00:14.724 --> 00:15.892
Then use the shoot button,

00:16.059 --> 00:18.311
not "The wonderful thing
about Tiggers" button!

00:19.854 --> 00:20.855
Oh.

00:21.147 --> 00:22.857
That's it. We're dead.

00:23.191 --> 00:24.401
Challenge them again.

00:24.567 --> 00:25.777
Doing it right now.

00:26.903 --> 00:30.031
They can't, there's an important
Little League game tomorrow.

00:32.158 --> 00:34.494
No wonder they beat us, they're jocks.

00:35.704 --> 00:38.623
What happened to me?
I used to excel at these things.

00:38.832 --> 00:40.542
Kids are always better at video games.

00:40.709 --> 00:42.043
Well, I don't like it.

00:42.377 --> 00:44.713
If it makes you feel better,
you still dress like a child.

00:46.381 --> 00:47.632
I mean, it's not just video games.

00:47.799 --> 00:50.051
I've downloaded the new OS for my phone,

00:50.218 --> 00:53.972
took me a week to stop accidentally
texting kissy faces to everyone.

00:54.973 --> 00:56.683
Oh. So our love is not real?

00:57.642 --> 00:59.602
Well, I know how you feel.

00:59.769 --> 01:02.272
I tried one of those
electronic Japanese toilets.

01:02.439 --> 01:05.150
Practically shot myself across the room.

01:06.568 --> 01:09.654
I guess I just need to face it,
I'm no longer a wunderkind.

01:09.821 --> 01:12.073
And now, I just wonder what's for lunch.

01:12.490 --> 01:14.325
- Hot dogs.
- Yay.

01:42.687 --> 01:44.689
I didn't know you could drink
while you're breastfeeding.

01:44.856 --> 01:47.400
Yeah, they say the yeast in beer
helps with milk production.

01:47.567 --> 01:49.694
I'm pretty sure that's a myth,
let me check.

01:49.861 --> 01:52.864
Ruin it for me and I'll break this glass
over your head!

01:54.365 --> 01:55.617
- To denial!
- Whoo!

01:57.035 --> 01:59.454
I'm gonna get another. You want food?

01:59.704 --> 02:02.415
Yeah, breastfeeding burns
like 5,000 calories a day.

02:02.582 --> 02:04.083
Do not touch that phone.

02:08.880 --> 02:09.964
Penny?

02:10.381 --> 02:11.591
Oh, Zack, hey!

02:11.758 --> 02:13.384
What are the odds of
running into you here?

02:13.551 --> 02:15.887
Well, it's a bar, so pretty good.

02:16.805 --> 02:17.847
Uh, what's new?

02:18.014 --> 02:19.265
Oh, tons of stuff.

02:19.432 --> 02:21.059
Put artificial grass in my backyard,

02:21.226 --> 02:24.771
got engaged, had a scary mole
that turned out to be sharpie.

02:25.939 --> 02:27.357
Well, congratulations!

02:27.524 --> 02:29.692
That's what my dermatologist said.

02:30.151 --> 02:32.362
No, on getting engaged. Good for you!

02:32.529 --> 02:34.113
Oh, thanks. How about you?

02:34.280 --> 02:36.574
How's Leonard? Is he still smart?

02:36.908 --> 02:41.538
Yes. Yes, he's working for the government
on an infinite persistence gyroscope.

02:41.704 --> 02:44.707
Of course, the first time I say it right,
he's not even here.

02:44.958 --> 02:46.626
God, I love that little guy.

02:46.793 --> 02:48.169
Hey, we should all have dinner sometime.

02:48.503 --> 02:50.380
Uh, yeah, sure, I'll check with Leonard.

02:50.547 --> 02:52.632
Cool. I'll check with Sara.

02:53.466 --> 02:55.343
Sara, pull up my calendar.

02:58.137 --> 02:59.430
It never works for me.

03:03.768 --> 03:06.938
I've been thinking about
our recent humiliation.

03:07.230 --> 03:09.232
You're gonna have to be more specific.

03:10.024 --> 03:11.651
At the hands of those teenagers.

03:13.278 --> 03:14.404
More.

03:15.947 --> 03:17.240
Boy teenagers.

03:17.615 --> 03:19.617
Oh, the video game! Yeah, that was bad.

03:20.785 --> 03:23.413
I started doing some reading
on cognitive vitality,

03:23.580 --> 03:27.041
and I came across an area of research
called "super-aging."

03:27.458 --> 03:31.462
You know who's a super-ager?
Jennifer Lopez. Like, what is her secret?

03:33.131 --> 03:37.343
Well, this is rare, I don't know which
one of you I want to stop talking first.

03:39.470 --> 03:42.307
The theory is that
if you really tax your brain,

03:42.473 --> 03:46.227
the neurofibers will become thicker
and the glial cells more lustrous.

03:46.394 --> 03:47.979
- Like J-Lo's hair.
- Yeah...

03:49.564 --> 03:51.816
It is neck-and-neck right now.

03:52.901 --> 03:56.154
How is super-aging any different than
like, doing crossword puzzles?

03:56.321 --> 03:58.156
Well, it's not just doing
simple cognitive tasks.

03:58.323 --> 04:02.285
You need to push your brain out of its
comfort zone and reach mental exhaustion.

04:02.744 --> 04:05.830
I drive you to work every day,
my brain must look like the Hulk.

04:07.832 --> 04:11.002
You really want to challenge yourself,
you could learn to speak Hindi.

04:16.507 --> 04:19.510
Could you say that in English?
I actually... I never learned Hindi.

04:23.514 --> 04:24.807
Hey, you ready to go?

04:24.974 --> 04:26.142
Yeah, I guess.

04:26.517 --> 04:27.685
What's the matter?

04:28.895 --> 04:31.230
Honestly? It's a little strange
having dinner with your ex-boyfriend,

04:31.397 --> 04:33.358
and it's not like
we have a lot to talk about.

04:33.524 --> 04:35.193
What... He loves you, okay?

04:35.360 --> 04:36.694
And he's interested in your work.

04:36.861 --> 04:41.449
You could talk about the infinite
perspective... I swear I know it.

04:43.284 --> 04:44.535
It'll be fine, let's just go.

04:44.702 --> 04:46.037
Well, and his fiancee will be there.

04:46.204 --> 04:48.915
So, you know, if the conversation lags,
we can talk about their wedding.

04:49.123 --> 04:50.124
Oh!

04:50.333 --> 04:52.293
Come on,
I spent an entire plane ride with you

04:52.460 --> 04:54.253
talking about the trailer for <i>Deadpool 2.</i>

04:54.462 --> 04:56.381
Ha! I knew you weren't asleep.

04:58.716 --> 04:59.717
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

04:59.884 --> 05:01.386
Hey, where's your fiancee?

05:01.552 --> 05:03.596
She couldn't make it.
She had an emergency.

05:03.846 --> 05:04.931
Oh, no, what happened?

05:05.682 --> 05:06.891
Didn't ask.

05:10.895 --> 05:12.021
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:12.188 --> 05:13.231
Hey!

05:13.398 --> 05:14.691
What smells so good?

05:14.857 --> 05:17.110
Raj is teaching me to make croissants.

05:17.402 --> 05:19.570
Is this part of your super-aging?

05:19.904 --> 05:22.156
<i>Yes.
Yeah, it seemed daunting at first,</i>

05:22.323 --> 05:25.159
but then I realized, it's like the
chemistry set I had as a kid.

05:25.326 --> 05:28.454
Yeah, only when your brother eats this,
no one has to call Poison Control.

05:29.914 --> 05:31.582
- Okay, shall we?
- Mm-hmm.

05:36.045 --> 05:38.506
Oh, my God. It's light,

05:38.923 --> 05:41.926
it's flaky, it's buttery.

05:42.260 --> 05:44.637
You don't need to have sex with him,
just eat one of these.

05:46.764 --> 05:48.349
Yes, it is delicious.

05:48.599 --> 05:51.769
But, physicist, baker, lover,
what can't I do?

05:53.312 --> 05:55.189
Well, clearly mental tasks are not enough.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.191
Maybe you need to challenge
your motor skills.

05:57.358 --> 06:00.278
For the last time,
I am not having a tickle fight with you.

06:01.988 --> 06:05.950
You want a real challenge,
try keeping me from eating more of these.

06:07.118 --> 06:09.328
You're just using food to mask the fear

06:09.495 --> 06:13.291
that you're fundamentally unlovable
and therefore going to be alone forever.

06:14.584 --> 06:16.127
Damn it, he's good at that too.

06:19.672 --> 06:20.798
Thanks.

06:21.466 --> 06:24.302
Wow, working on a top-secret
government project,

06:24.469 --> 06:25.511
- that is so cool.
- Oh.

06:25.970 --> 06:28.181
Do you have a bodyguard
to keep spies away?

06:29.182 --> 06:31.809
I have Sheldon,
that keeps most people away.

06:33.394 --> 06:34.562
I miss that guy.

06:34.812 --> 06:36.564
He's like the Swedish Chef Muppet.

06:36.731 --> 06:38.858
I don't know what he's saying,
but he's funny.

06:40.193 --> 06:42.987
Oh, I know what he's saying, and he's not.
He's not funny.

06:43.821 --> 06:46.657
So, Penny,
what's going on with you, how's the job?

06:46.866 --> 06:49.285
It's okay,
I'm still in pharmaceutical sales.

06:49.494 --> 06:50.745
Doing amazing.

06:50.912 --> 06:52.455
She can actually make a side effect like

06:52.622 --> 06:58.336
"10% chance of liver failure" sound like
a 90% chance of liver success.

06:58.711 --> 07:01.047
Yeah, lying isn't my
favorite part of the job.

07:01.255 --> 07:03.091
Actually, I'm not crazy about a lot of it.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.342
If you're not happy there,

07:04.509 --> 07:06.385
I've been looking for a new
head of sales at my company.

07:06.552 --> 07:08.679
And we don't sell drugs, just menus.

07:08.888 --> 07:11.808
So the only lie you'll be telling
is we print on recycled paper.

07:14.143 --> 07:15.520
We don't.

07:17.897 --> 07:19.357
Well, that's a nice offer.

07:19.649 --> 07:21.025
You know, we'd make a great team.

07:21.192 --> 07:25.863
Or as we say in the menu business,
I can't do this without "me 'n' you."

07:27.865 --> 07:29.575
Right, 'cause it spells "menu."

07:29.742 --> 07:31.327
Yeah, right? It's funny.

07:31.494 --> 07:33.538
I got a lot of menu jokes,
but that's my favorite.

07:37.708 --> 07:40.378
All right, this is everything.

07:40.545 --> 07:41.796
What do you want to learn?

07:42.130 --> 07:44.590
It really doesn't matter
as long as it's challenging.

07:45.216 --> 07:47.593
Okay, well, how about...

07:47.969 --> 07:51.389
I teach you some close-up magic.

07:53.099 --> 07:56.310
Howard, I'm trying to make
myself uncomfortable, not everyone else.

07:58.563 --> 08:02.066
So you wanted to learn something physical
and you came to Howard Wolowitz?

08:03.526 --> 08:08.281
Hey, the circus arts are very
physically and mentally demanding.

08:08.573 --> 08:09.782
Have you ever tried to juggle?

08:09.949 --> 08:13.953
Yes, I'm juggling my love for you
and my embarrassment of you right now.

08:16.247 --> 08:17.707
And it's hard, isn't it?

08:19.750 --> 08:21.586
So, the key is

08:21.752 --> 08:25.923
the moment one ball is at the
top of its arc, you toss the next one.

08:26.382 --> 08:28.217
- Hm?
- Okay, I think I got that.

08:28.384 --> 08:29.552
No, now, hold on.

08:29.719 --> 08:32.263
There's an old saying in juggling...

08:32.430 --> 08:34.390
Is it, "I'm going to die alone?"

08:37.768 --> 08:41.272
No, it's, "If you want to have fun,
start with one."

08:42.315 --> 08:43.691
Yours we think, but we do not say.

08:44.942 --> 08:48.696
All right, just toss it up and catch it
a few times, get comfortable with it.

08:48.863 --> 08:50.072
Okay.

08:55.786 --> 08:59.749
Just to be on the safe side, am I
in any danger of getting juggler's elbow?

09:00.458 --> 09:01.751
No.

09:03.127 --> 09:05.296
Are you sure, 'cause I'm feeling a twinge.

09:08.049 --> 09:10.509
See, that wasn't so bad.
He even picked up the check.

09:10.676 --> 09:13.179
Yeah. Although when he was
trying to figure out the tip,

09:13.346 --> 09:15.848
I'm pretty sure I saw
smoke coming out of his ears.

09:18.100 --> 09:20.311
You're not really considering
working for him, are you?

09:20.478 --> 09:22.813
Well, maybe, I mean,
it seems kind of perfect.

09:22.980 --> 09:25.316
I have sales experience,
and I've been a waitress,

09:25.483 --> 09:26.692
so I have restaurant experience.

09:26.859 --> 09:30.529
And if he's figuring out my
Christmas bonus, we could buy a boat.

09:32.073 --> 09:33.824
But don't you think
it might be a little weird

09:33.991 --> 09:35.701
to work for someone you used to date?

09:36.035 --> 09:37.912
You work with Sheldon, you tell me.

09:40.998 --> 09:42.416
Yeah, it's weird.

09:46.837 --> 09:49.340
Okay, are you seriously jealous of me
working with Zack?

09:49.548 --> 09:51.050
No, no! I'm not jealous.

09:51.217 --> 09:53.552
I just think you have a good thing going
where you are right now,

09:53.719 --> 09:56.806
and you make great money and you haven't
slept with any of your coworkers.

09:57.682 --> 10:00.643
Great, so you want me to stay at a job
I'm not happy at.

10:01.185 --> 10:02.687
Uh...

10:03.396 --> 10:06.857
You okay? You kind of look like Zack
trying to figure out that tip.

10:08.693 --> 10:11.487
Of course, I don't want you to be unhappy,

10:11.654 --> 10:13.281
but I also want you to be smart.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.908
And working for an ex-boyfriend
isn't very smart.

10:18.286 --> 10:20.204
You don't have to stop,
just slow down, I'll jump out.

10:28.045 --> 10:29.964
Amy, look, I'm on a unicycle!

10:32.049 --> 10:35.594
How did you get from croissants
to a unicycle?

10:35.928 --> 10:37.430
I hurt myself juggling.

10:39.140 --> 10:40.349
Where did you get it?

10:40.516 --> 10:43.394
Howard said I could borrow it,
Bernadette said forever.

10:45.563 --> 10:46.939
Have you tried letting go of the rope?

10:47.106 --> 10:49.358
What, are you crazy? I'm on a unicycle!

10:50.901 --> 10:52.403
All right, well, have fun.

10:52.611 --> 10:54.071
Wait, I need help getting down.

10:54.572 --> 10:55.781
Well, what do you want me to do?

10:56.032 --> 10:57.742
Drag out our mattress
and put it over here.

10:57.908 --> 11:00.411
Then go across the hall, get their
mattress and put it over here.

11:00.578 --> 11:02.788
Yeah, but before you do any of that,
scratch my nose.

11:07.418 --> 11:10.087
So, you told her she was being dumb?

11:10.379 --> 11:13.341
No, I told her she was being "not smart."

11:15.301 --> 11:16.719
Which was dumb.

11:18.304 --> 11:20.097
Why did you even
go to dinner with the guy?

11:20.264 --> 11:22.141
We covered this. I'm dumb.

11:24.602 --> 11:26.479
So, he's my ex-boyfriend, who cares?

11:26.729 --> 11:28.439
I can't believe
Leonard would be so insecure.

11:28.731 --> 11:31.400
Really? I have no trouble
believing that at all.

11:33.402 --> 11:36.113
And Zack's engaged,
Leonard has no reason to feel threatened.

11:36.447 --> 11:38.366
We're talking about
the same Leonard, right?

11:40.576 --> 11:42.828
So you think it's fine
if she works for Zack?

11:43.454 --> 11:44.538
I don't know, maybe?

11:44.705 --> 11:47.208
Well, he is much more attractive
than Leonard.

11:48.667 --> 11:53.047
Yes, but that's gonna be true
of a lot of guys she works for.

11:55.091 --> 11:57.051
Yeah, but she also
used to sleep with Zack.

11:58.344 --> 11:59.470
Again.

12:02.390 --> 12:04.308
I would never let Howard work with an ex.

12:04.475 --> 12:05.476
What, you wouldn't trust him?

12:05.643 --> 12:06.936
I wouldn't trust her.

12:07.103 --> 12:09.980
He's thin and sexy
like a Jewish greyhound.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.444
Yeah, that is the sexiest dog.

12:17.363 --> 12:19.865
And I'd like to think Howie wouldn't
take a job I was uncomfortable with.

12:20.116 --> 12:21.200
- Because he's scared of you?
- Terrified.

12:21.367 --> 12:22.660
Yeah.

12:23.869 --> 12:25.704
You know what,
I'm with Leonard, this isn't cool.

12:26.122 --> 12:27.206
Thank you.

12:27.415 --> 12:30.418
I disagree.
Penny is a strong, independent woman.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.837
The more you try to control her,
the more she'll push back.

12:33.170 --> 12:34.296
So you think it's okay?

12:34.505 --> 12:37.925
No. She's gonna leave you for someone,
might as well get it over with.

12:43.514 --> 12:44.849
What are you doing?

12:45.099 --> 12:46.600
I'm returning this stuff to Howard.

12:47.351 --> 12:50.146
Oh, well, Bernadette made me promise
if you didn't want it,

12:50.312 --> 12:52.148
we'd give it to a homeless clown.

12:55.192 --> 12:56.861
What happened to learning the unicycle?

12:57.111 --> 12:58.654
I stopped that, it was dumb.

12:58.863 --> 13:02.241
Uni, bi, tri, menstrual,
all cycles are dumb.

13:04.452 --> 13:06.078
You said juggling was dumb too.

13:06.370 --> 13:10.249
Well, it is! If I wanted to hold three
things at once, I'd wear cargo pants.

13:11.375 --> 13:16.672
Sheldon, is it possible that when things
get really difficult, you just give up?

13:17.506 --> 13:19.049
Are you calling me a quitter?

13:19.884 --> 13:21.010
Well, if you honestly...

13:21.177 --> 13:22.219
This conversation is over.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.225
His mother warned me.

13:29.727 --> 13:31.228
Everybody warned me.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.398
Actually, he warned me.

13:39.236 --> 13:40.738
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:41.572 --> 13:42.656
You wanna talk?

13:43.115 --> 13:45.493
That doesn't seem to be where I shine.

13:47.745 --> 13:50.039
How about I just give you one of these?

13:51.123 --> 13:54.460
Look, we can have a reasonable
conversation, and I won't get mad.

13:57.171 --> 13:59.924
I don't like it after sex,
and I don't like it now.

14:05.554 --> 14:06.847
- Yeah, sorry.
- Yeah.

14:07.598 --> 14:09.141
Okay, just come here.

14:09.934 --> 14:13.270
Look, I get me working with Zack is weird,
and I don't want you to be uncomfortable.

14:13.437 --> 14:17.441
Well, thanks. And I don't want you to be
stuck at a job you don't like.

14:17.733 --> 14:18.734
What do we do?

14:18.943 --> 14:20.861
Well, I don't love it, but if you
really want to take this job,

14:21.028 --> 14:22.530
I'll find a way to deal with it.

14:22.696 --> 14:23.989
No, I know you'll try,

14:24.156 --> 14:26.825
but it'll make you miserable,
which will make me miserable, and...

14:27.159 --> 14:28.536
I'm just gonna stay where I'm at for now.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.746
No, no, no! You're unhappy there,

14:30.913 --> 14:32.498
and then you're gonna blame me
for making you stay.

14:32.665 --> 14:34.458
And it's fine, I'll just...
I'll suck it up.

14:34.792 --> 14:36.293
You don't need to do that! It's okay.

14:37.086 --> 14:40.839
Yeah, see, now I feel terrible, like
I'm being selfish and holding you back.

14:45.678 --> 14:47.012
What? Say something.

14:51.642 --> 14:52.810
Yeah, that is pretty annoying.

14:57.147 --> 14:58.315
I made you tea.

14:58.482 --> 14:59.608
Thank you.

15:00.359 --> 15:01.652
I'm sorry I called you a quitter.

15:02.027 --> 15:04.697
It's okay,
I stopped being upset about that.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.157
And no, the irony is not lost on me.

15:08.784 --> 15:09.994
What are you reading?

15:10.244 --> 15:14.832
This article says the peak age for making
a Nobel Prize-winning discovery is 40.

15:15.165 --> 15:17.543
- So?
- So I'm running out of time.

15:17.918 --> 15:20.963
That's ridiculous. You're a brilliant man.

15:21.297 --> 15:23.424
The best years of your life
are still ahead of you.

15:23.632 --> 15:26.176
Oh, you have to say that,
you're sweet on me.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.345
Well, if you're really worried
about your career,

15:28.512 --> 15:30.806
maybe you should consider
spending a little less time

15:30.973 --> 15:32.725
with video games and comic books.

15:33.142 --> 15:34.143
Hey!

15:34.560 --> 15:36.729
I thought you were sweet on me!

15:37.229 --> 15:39.857
Okay, fine,
let's say you never win a Nobel Prize.

15:40.232 --> 15:43.027
Let's say you spend your life
doing solid scientific research

15:43.193 --> 15:45.988
surrounded by friends and loved ones
who appreciate you,

15:46.238 --> 15:49.366
not for what you've accomplished
but for who you are as a man.

15:49.783 --> 15:51.577
Wouldn't that be a life well lived?

15:53.412 --> 15:54.413
You're so cute.

15:56.206 --> 15:57.916
I'm gonna go learn how to walk on stilts.

16:01.670 --> 16:02.880
So many warnings.

16:07.176 --> 16:08.385
Okay, are you sure about this?

16:08.552 --> 16:10.387
Absolutely. I just want you to be happy,

16:10.846 --> 16:13.265
and maybe a little turned on
about how selfless I'm being.

16:16.727 --> 16:17.811
Penny, what's up?

16:18.312 --> 16:22.232
Hey, so, I've been thinking about it,
and I wanna take the job.

16:22.566 --> 16:24.401
Oh, bad news.

16:24.735 --> 16:27.696
When my fiancee found out that
I was offering a job to my ex-girlfriend,

16:27.863 --> 16:30.908
she said it was a stupid idea
and threw a shoe at me.

16:32.618 --> 16:34.703
Oh. So there's no job?

16:34.953 --> 16:37.581
Nope, just a little bump on my forehead.

16:39.291 --> 16:41.460
Okay, thanks anyway. Bye.

16:43.087 --> 16:46.507
Well, his fiancee thought the idea of us
working together was stupid.

16:47.091 --> 16:48.634
You were right, I was wrong.

16:54.264 --> 16:55.641
Aren't you gonna say anything?

16:56.308 --> 16:58.185
Not if I wanna be doing this later.

17:03.732 --> 17:06.193
Hey, I didn't know you were at home.
Where've you been?

17:06.610 --> 17:08.070
I went to see your mom.

17:08.696 --> 17:10.197
Seriously, where were you?

17:10.781 --> 17:12.366
I just told you, your mom's.

17:12.616 --> 17:13.909
Why?

17:14.076 --> 17:17.413
Well, since you find my magic tricks
so embarrassing,

17:17.663 --> 17:21.917
I got to wondering
what cool hobbies you had as a kid.

17:22.960 --> 17:23.961
Oh.

17:24.294 --> 17:25.504
What'd she say?

17:26.964 --> 17:28.424
She didn't say much of anything.

17:28.590 --> 17:31.635
But she said a lot!

17:33.679 --> 17:35.931
Hi, Bernadette, remember me?

17:38.726 --> 17:40.644
First of all,
that's not what she sounds like.

17:40.811 --> 17:42.980
She's from South Carolina.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.775
I can't believe you made fun of me
all these years

17:46.942 --> 17:49.778
while you were a closeted ventriloquist.

17:50.904 --> 17:54.116
Okay, it's not like
I wanted to be a ventriloquist.

17:54.283 --> 17:56.535
I was in beauty pageants,
and I needed a talent

17:56.702 --> 17:59.496
besides spreading rumors
that the other contestants were pregnant.

18:00.998 --> 18:03.834
Well, since you enjoyed getting rid of
all my stuff,

18:04.001 --> 18:06.503
maybe we should throw
this little lady in the wood chipper.

18:06.670 --> 18:09.506
No! And the little lady has a name.

18:10.507 --> 18:11.508
Which is?

18:13.510 --> 18:15.637
Tammy Jo Saint Cloud.

18:17.681 --> 18:20.058
"Tammy Jo Saint Cloud."

18:20.309 --> 18:21.852
And I'm a dork for juggling.

18:22.811 --> 18:24.521
Sorry. You're not a dork.

18:25.355 --> 18:26.690
You're a clown.

18:28.692 --> 18:31.570
Tammy Jo, don't say that.
You'll make him feel bad.

18:32.029 --> 18:35.157
Look at him.
What reason he got to feel good?

18:37.284 --> 18:38.869
All right, very funny.

18:39.036 --> 18:41.830
Don't listen to her,
she's been in a box for like, 25 years.

18:42.539 --> 18:45.334
Yeah, back when his haircut
was fashionable.

18:48.504 --> 18:49.755
That's enough. Put her away.

18:50.214 --> 18:52.674
Oh, Big Daddy, I don't think so.

18:52.841 --> 18:55.385
You marry Ms. Bernie, you marry me.

18:56.553 --> 18:58.388
We are family now.

19:01.058 --> 19:02.392
You're freaking me out.

19:02.684 --> 19:03.727
Don't be that way.

19:03.894 --> 19:07.606
If you don't mind a few splinters,
we can have us a menage a trois.

19:07.898 --> 19:08.899
Oh!

19:16.657 --> 19:20.369
I'm doing it. I'm doing it!

19:20.994 --> 19:23.163
I'm tall and I'm doing it!

19:27.960 --> 19:29.419
Aw, man.

19:59.199 --> 20:00.200
