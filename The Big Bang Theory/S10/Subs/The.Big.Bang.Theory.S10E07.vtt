00:05.090 --> 00:07.592
Hello, I'm Doctor Sheldon Cooper.

00:07.759 --> 00:09.636
And I'm Doctor Amy Farrah Fowler.

00:09.844 --> 00:12.722
And welcome to the first
on-location episode

00:12.889 --> 00:16.142
of Doctor Sheldon Cooper and
Doctor Amy Farrah Fowler present...

00:16.351 --> 00:18.978
<i>Doctor Sheldon Cooper's
Fun with Flags.</i>

00:21.314 --> 00:22.482
Hit it.

00:23.441 --> 00:26.611
<i>For joy and fun
there's no better manner</i>

00:26.778 --> 00:30.448
<i>Than to fly a pennant
flag or banner</i>

00:30.657 --> 00:33.785
<i>What fills my heart
and makes my eyes moist</i>

00:33.952 --> 00:36.955
<i>Sending a flag up a pole on a hoist</i>

00:37.539 --> 00:40.166
<i>Fun with flags
Fun with flags</i>

00:40.458 --> 00:44.045
<i>Oh! Say can you see</i>

00:44.421 --> 00:46.381
<i>It's fun with flags</i>

00:46.631 --> 00:48.133
<i>Fun with flags</i>

00:52.512 --> 00:53.763
As you may notice,

00:54.013 --> 00:57.225
just one of the changes around
here is our new house band.

01:01.312 --> 01:02.814
Who haven't learned their place yet.

01:06.276 --> 01:09.654
We're also coming to you live
from a different apartment.

01:09.904 --> 01:13.032
Doctor Fowler and I began an
experiment in living together

01:13.241 --> 01:15.368
after her apartment
became water damaged.

01:15.618 --> 01:17.662
This is our friend Penny's place.

01:17.871 --> 01:19.748
You may remember her
from our episode,

01:19.956 --> 01:23.042
<i>Flags, and the People
Who Don't Understand Them.</i>

01:24.294 --> 01:26.171
So, in the spirit of cohabitation,

01:26.337 --> 01:27.756
the theme of today's episode

01:27.964 --> 01:31.009
is flags of two regions
coming together as one.

01:31.426 --> 01:34.804
Such as the flag
of Saint Kitts and Nevis.

01:35.180 --> 01:38.683
So let's roll up our "sleeves"
and get to know "Nevis."

01:43.188 --> 01:45.356
I like that,
but next time check with me.

01:47.275 --> 01:48.693
<i>Did you know, that the flag</i>

01:48.985 --> 01:50.904
<i>was designed by
a student named Edrice Lewis...</i>

01:51.112 --> 01:52.322
I can't believe I'm saying this,

01:52.530 --> 01:54.866
but can we watch the news
or something?

01:56.409 --> 01:58.203
It's cute, they're
having fun living together.

01:58.453 --> 02:00.997
Yeah, I wonder what they're
gonna do when her apartment's ready.

02:01.206 --> 02:03.917
- Actually, it's been ready for weeks.
- What do you mean?

02:04.167 --> 02:05.543
Well, they finished the work early,

02:05.794 --> 02:08.046
but she's been telling Sheldon
they're behind schedule.

02:08.338 --> 02:11.800
- So, she's just been lying to him?
- Well, you've lied to Sheldon.

02:12.008 --> 02:15.053
Yeah, but to make him leave,
not to make him stay.

02:16.971 --> 02:21.309
Buda and Pest
united to form Budapest.

02:21.518 --> 02:25.188
And that's why Budapest
is the "Buda-best."

02:28.233 --> 02:29.651
- Now.
- Sorry!

03:00.306 --> 03:02.559
Thank you for
your services, gentlemen.

03:02.767 --> 03:04.435
I'm hoping to broaden our audience

03:04.602 --> 03:06.604
with your youthful rock 'n' roll music.

03:08.273 --> 03:10.608
Aw, you think you have an audience,
that's funny!

03:13.111 --> 03:16.281
We don't get paid? Nothing?
Not even a sandwich?

03:19.576 --> 03:22.620
It's almost dinner time,
you in the mood for anything?

03:23.121 --> 03:25.081
You know, we could get
Thai food near your apartment

03:25.290 --> 03:28.126
and then drop in
and check on the progress.

03:29.168 --> 03:32.380
Oh, you don't wanna do that,
it's a construction zone.

03:32.881 --> 03:33.923
So?

03:34.132 --> 03:37.802
Well, what about your fear
of stray nails and butt cracks?

03:38.970 --> 03:43.099
I am terrified of stepping on a nail
and falling into a butt crack.

03:44.642 --> 03:46.644
Anyway, how about dinner?

03:46.936 --> 03:49.856
You know, if you'd like, I could
call your landlord and complain.

03:50.732 --> 03:52.317
Thanks, but you don't have to.

03:52.609 --> 03:54.819
Oh, I don't mind,
I'm very good at complaining.

03:55.653 --> 03:57.322
Yeah. If it were an Olympic sport,

03:57.530 --> 03:59.198
I'd complain about
what a stupid sport it is

03:59.407 --> 04:00.491
and then I'd take home the gold.

04:03.494 --> 04:06.581
Good stuff. So, uh, what about dinner?

04:08.207 --> 04:11.502
Is it me or are you purposely
changing the subject?

04:12.378 --> 04:13.504
No.

04:13.796 --> 04:17.133
And on the subject of subjects,
is your use of the word "subject"

04:17.342 --> 04:20.970
the same or different as when
we speak about the subject of a king?

04:24.682 --> 04:27.268
I have a feeling
you're still doing it.

04:27.518 --> 04:29.354
But I find that topic irresistible so,

04:29.604 --> 04:31.940
now in ancient Mesopotamia,

04:32.106 --> 04:35.193
the King referred
to the people as his property.

04:37.362 --> 04:40.865
I'm serious,
JPL's actually developing a robot arm

04:41.074 --> 04:43.826
that could grab
an asteroid before it hits us.

04:44.118 --> 04:47.038
So their plan for saving
the Earth from Armageddon

04:47.205 --> 04:49.874
is hoping a bunch of
scientists can catch a ball?

04:51.042 --> 04:54.337
If we're all gonna die,
why am I eating so much kale?

04:56.047 --> 04:57.548
You're awful quiet, everything okay?

04:58.549 --> 05:02.553
I'm concerned about Amy.
She's acting a bit odd, lately.

05:03.346 --> 05:07.809
Just out of curiosity
what registers as "odd" to you?

05:12.647 --> 05:13.940
Her behavior.

05:14.148 --> 05:16.567
Now, I have the feeling
that she's hiding something.

05:17.235 --> 05:20.154
I wouldn't worry about it,
she's probably distracted by work.

05:20.571 --> 05:22.073
Well, whatever it is,
it's troubling me.

05:22.407 --> 05:24.075
I can't eat, I can't sleep,

05:24.409 --> 05:27.245
and don't even ask about the
consistency of my bowel movements.

05:29.330 --> 05:31.666
You heard him, guys, don't ask.

05:32.709 --> 05:34.252
Why would she keep something from me?

05:34.544 --> 05:37.130
You know,
I shared my body with that woman.

05:37.296 --> 05:39.215
And my Netflix password!

05:40.466 --> 05:42.218
They recommended
<i>Stella Got Her Groove Back</i>

05:42.468 --> 05:43.970
because of her.

05:45.596 --> 05:49.100
Buddy, but, listen.
Nothing bad is going on, she just...

05:50.393 --> 05:52.812
She just didn't want you to know
that the work on her apartment

05:53.021 --> 05:54.439
was finished a couple weeks ago.

05:55.982 --> 05:57.358
I don't understand.

05:57.650 --> 06:01.279
She's enjoying living with you
and she didn't want it to end early.

06:02.447 --> 06:06.701
So, she's deceiving me in order
to spend more time with me.

06:07.368 --> 06:08.745
Yes.

06:09.620 --> 06:12.665
Well, I feel both
flattered and hurt, you know?

06:13.124 --> 06:14.625
Like when people say
I look like that skeleton

06:14.834 --> 06:16.794
from <i>Nightmare Before Christmas.</i>

06:18.463 --> 06:20.715
Oh, my God, that's who you look like!

06:22.550 --> 06:23.968
Sheldon, this is not a big deal.

06:24.218 --> 06:25.595
It's a little white lie,
everyone does it.

06:25.928 --> 06:29.515
Not me, I'm 100% honest
in all of my relationships.

06:29.766 --> 06:31.476
And how single are you right now?

06:32.894 --> 06:35.063
Eating cake on the toilet single.

06:36.439 --> 06:39.192
Well, I won't tolerate
deception in my relationship.

06:39.442 --> 06:41.319
Now I have no choice
but to confront her.

06:41.611 --> 06:44.280
Don't do that, you've got gold here.

06:44.489 --> 06:48.618
Hang onto it until you're in trouble
and then throw it in her face.

06:50.203 --> 06:53.164
Why would you tell him that?
That's terrible advice.

06:53.372 --> 06:56.292
So you wouldn't want
to have anything on Penny?

06:56.501 --> 06:57.919
Well, of course not.

06:58.252 --> 07:02.840
So, if I actually know
something right now, and I do,

07:05.218 --> 07:06.344
you don't want me to tell you?

07:07.261 --> 07:11.474
- Uh... No.
- I'll take that as a yes.

07:13.184 --> 07:16.020
She's secretly been moving
your collectibles into storage

07:16.187 --> 07:18.022
a little at a time
and you haven't noticed.

07:18.272 --> 07:19.565
Are you kidding me?

07:19.857 --> 07:22.068
See? I've known
that for weeks, but, you know,

07:22.235 --> 07:26.155
I waited till the moment when
it would cause him the most pain.

07:32.161 --> 07:34.872
Superman's gone,
my Stormtrooper's gone?

07:35.123 --> 07:37.750
Your Klingon
word-of-the-day calendar's gone.

07:38.584 --> 07:41.587
I'd say "damn it" in Klingon
but that wasn't until next month.

07:42.922 --> 07:44.382
- It's "<i>khoo-vakh."
- "Khoo-vakh."</i>

07:46.509 --> 07:47.927
She took my Where's Waldo!

07:48.219 --> 07:51.389
- Well, no, no, he's over there.
- Oh, yeah, there he is.

07:54.183 --> 07:56.769
So, what's the deal
with your apartment?

07:57.019 --> 07:59.063
Why is it taking so long?

07:59.605 --> 08:02.108
Uh, it was a drywall problem.

08:02.358 --> 08:04.277
Oh, no. What happened?

08:05.653 --> 08:10.074
Well, the drywall got wet
and you do not want wet drywall

08:10.366 --> 08:14.120
because when drywall
gets wet it's really more...

08:14.412 --> 08:15.705
Wet wall?

08:17.456 --> 08:19.500
- Or damp wall! Just as bad.
- Mmm.

08:21.502 --> 08:24.213
So why don't
they just get more drywall?

08:24.505 --> 08:26.883
Well, they went to get some

08:27.216 --> 08:29.635
but the woman at the wall store

08:30.928 --> 08:32.763
said it was going on sale
and they should wait

08:33.014 --> 08:35.474
- because the savings of the...
- Okay, are you done?

08:35.808 --> 08:37.435
Bernadette told me
your apartment's ready.

08:37.643 --> 08:41.147
I was done at wet wall
but you wouldn't let it go.

08:41.772 --> 08:44.317
Is Sheldon really believing all this crap?

08:44.525 --> 08:47.111
Well, he started to question it,
but then I fake sneezed on him

08:47.320 --> 08:48.779
and he ran to take a shower.

08:50.406 --> 08:52.325
Please don't say anything,
I feel terrible about this.

08:52.825 --> 08:55.077
- Oh, don't worry, I won't.
- Thanks.

08:57.163 --> 08:59.916
- The woman at the wall store?
- Let it go!

09:02.919 --> 09:04.462
Are you going to confront Penny?

09:04.795 --> 09:06.047
Eventually, I guess.

09:06.297 --> 09:08.507
Although, I am kind of curious
how long she thinks

09:08.758 --> 09:10.593
she can keep hiding
my stuff without me knowing.

09:11.260 --> 09:12.303
Mmm.

09:13.137 --> 09:15.473
You know, perhaps
instead of confronting them,

09:15.681 --> 09:19.143
we should see how far they're
willing to spin their tangled webs.

09:19.310 --> 09:22.980
Like that Spider-Man action figure
that used to be on your desk.

09:23.147 --> 09:24.982
Oh, my God. I'm going blind!

09:27.485 --> 09:28.945
- Hi.
- Food's here.

09:30.738 --> 09:33.616
Excellent. I'm very hungry.

09:33.991 --> 09:36.994
Speaking of which,
what's going on with your apartment?

09:38.371 --> 09:44.335
- Oh. Uh, they're still working on it.
- Interesting. Very interesting.

09:45.878 --> 09:48.089
Yeah, we swung by her apartment
on the way to the restaurant.

09:48.297 --> 09:49.632
They're gonna be
fixing it for a while.

09:50.633 --> 09:53.135
Wait, you saw her apartment?

09:53.719 --> 09:55.554
I did. Still a mess.

10:00.059 --> 10:01.602
- Leonard?
- Yeah?

10:16.117 --> 10:18.077
Why are you speaking Klingon?

10:18.411 --> 10:20.162
Why are you speaking English?

10:21.539 --> 10:22.748
This is ridiculous.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.459
Penny, do you remember
when I taught you Ubbi-dubbi?

10:43.144 --> 10:45.354
- All right, stop that!
- You stop that!

10:50.651 --> 10:52.945
Okay. That's enough.
You know what?

10:53.112 --> 10:54.488
What is going on?

10:54.739 --> 10:57.575
Fine, I told Sheldon that
her apartment's been finished,

10:57.783 --> 10:59.952
and you said
it's not so now I'm all confused.

11:00.953 --> 11:02.997
Penny was just covering for me.

11:03.247 --> 11:04.915
My place has been
ready for two weeks.

11:05.124 --> 11:06.417
How could you lie to me?

11:06.709 --> 11:09.003
She's enjoyed living with you.
It's called being in love.

11:09.420 --> 11:11.255
And what's it called
when you secretly

11:11.422 --> 11:13.090
get rid of all your husband's stuff?

11:13.466 --> 11:15.092
That is not true!

11:15.426 --> 11:17.178
Bernadette told Howard,
Howard told me.

11:17.386 --> 11:19.597
Plus, I can see all my stuff is gone!

11:20.014 --> 11:21.640
Oh. So you believe your friend

11:21.891 --> 11:24.435
and your friend's wife
and your own eyes over me?

11:26.729 --> 11:27.730
Wow.

11:35.696 --> 11:38.449
You really didn't think
I'd notice my stuff was missing?

11:38.783 --> 11:40.409
Uh, did you notice your key chain?

11:45.373 --> 11:46.832
Where's Batman?

11:47.708 --> 11:49.627
Hey.

11:49.919 --> 11:51.796
Why did you tell Howard
I was hiding Leonard's things?

11:52.046 --> 11:53.047
One sec.

11:53.339 --> 11:55.883
Why did you tell Leonard I told you
Penny was hiding his things?

11:56.842 --> 12:01.514
It just came up because we were talking
about secrets and, wait...

12:03.474 --> 12:05.101
Yeah, would you stop it with that!

12:06.435 --> 12:09.980
I'm not really a part of this,
so I'm just gonna dig in.

12:11.023 --> 12:13.692
And I'd like to know why you
blabbed about my apartment?

12:13.984 --> 12:15.653
You're up, blabby.

12:17.196 --> 12:19.156
Amy, I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have said anything.

12:20.574 --> 12:22.159
I guess it's okay.

12:23.160 --> 12:26.247
I'm sorry
that I lied about my apartment.

12:27.081 --> 12:29.291
- It's all right.
- And?

12:29.917 --> 12:32.294
And, what?
Your wizard robes are next to go.

12:35.172 --> 12:36.590
Now that everything's out on the table,

12:36.799 --> 12:39.093
you think you two
will keep living together?

12:40.386 --> 12:42.471
Despite recent events,

12:42.721 --> 12:46.851
I do consider our experiment in
cohabitation to have been positive.

12:47.476 --> 12:49.770
Are you saying
you'd like to live with me?

12:50.646 --> 12:52.440
I'm open to the possibility.

12:56.819 --> 12:58.195
Whatever.

13:00.573 --> 13:02.533
You know, if he moves
across the hall for good,

13:02.741 --> 13:04.869
Leonard could keep the stuff
you don't like in Sheldon's old room.

13:05.077 --> 13:06.871
- Solves everything.
- That's a great idea!

13:07.037 --> 13:09.039
Ooh, maybe,
I could turn it into a gaming den.

13:09.248 --> 13:11.167
- That would be amazing.
- Well, hold, hold on.

13:11.375 --> 13:13.377
Excuse me, that's my room.

13:13.669 --> 13:14.753
But you won't be living here.

13:15.045 --> 13:16.672
- But that's my room.
- But you won't be living here.

13:16.881 --> 13:18.716
- But that's my room.
- You guys may want to start eating.

13:19.049 --> 13:20.301
But you won't be living here.

13:21.760 --> 13:24.555
Sweetie, once you stop paying rent,
none of this is really yours.

13:24.805 --> 13:27.808
- But that's my room.
- But you won't be living here.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.897
Thank you for understanding.

13:33.230 --> 13:34.732
Hey, I get it.

13:35.024 --> 13:37.735
Everybody wants
to spend more time with me.

13:38.652 --> 13:41.238
I'm like a man
made of sugar in a world of ants.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.034
- Good night.
- 'Night.

13:57.338 --> 14:01.133
If we did continue living together,
would it be here?

14:03.385 --> 14:05.429
I don't know. It could be.

14:06.263 --> 14:09.433
Of course there's,
there's always your apartment.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.895
Sure, sure,
we could live in my apartment.

14:13.187 --> 14:15.064
I hate your apartment.

14:16.857 --> 14:18.901
Sorry you brought it up?

14:19.818 --> 14:22.071
Well, I suppose
we could find a whole new place.

14:22.279 --> 14:24.949
You know, and technically we don't
even have to stay in Pasadena.

14:25.157 --> 14:27.701
You know, we could move to Altadena,

14:28.118 --> 14:30.871
or a place that
doesn't even end in "Dena."

14:31.539 --> 14:33.791
It's kind of exciting, I mean,

14:34.333 --> 14:35.543
we could do whatever we want.

14:36.669 --> 14:39.421
But what if we move
and we don't like it?

14:39.672 --> 14:42.716
What if there's a smoker
in the building? Or pets?

14:43.092 --> 14:46.345
Or, there could be mold.
There could be traffic noise.

14:46.595 --> 14:49.598
I'm gonna have to learn
a whole new bus route.

14:56.313 --> 14:57.690
Are you trying to soothe me

14:57.982 --> 15:00.234
by singing the
<i>Star Trek</i> theme as a lullaby?

15:01.485 --> 15:04.655
- Yes.
- I'm not a child, don't do that.

15:05.489 --> 15:06.532
Sorry.

15:10.911 --> 15:13.330
Do you know <i>2001: A Space Odyssey?</i>

15:25.259 --> 15:26.343
All right, now that's soothing.

15:36.061 --> 15:38.355
Look, I get it. It's still my room.

15:38.564 --> 15:41.442
- We haven't really made it yours.
- Thank you.

15:41.817 --> 15:44.820
Which is why I got you
this Pink Power Ranger.

15:47.364 --> 15:48.866
Put it anywhere you like.

15:49.241 --> 15:51.869
Okay, but you may
feel some discomfort.

15:53.454 --> 15:55.956
I'm kidding,
I want you to feel at home here.

15:56.206 --> 15:58.083
Decorate it any way
that makes you happy.

15:58.709 --> 16:00.586
- Do you really mean that?
- I really do.

16:01.003 --> 16:03.547
Great. And just so you know,
I'm not getting rid of all your stuff.

16:03.756 --> 16:04.923
Yeah? What are you keeping?

16:05.716 --> 16:07.509
That candle and you.

16:10.346 --> 16:13.974
- What about my robot poster?
- I can make do with just the candle.

16:20.898 --> 16:22.483
What's going on?

16:23.317 --> 16:26.153
I'm struggling with the thought
of leaving my old bedroom.

16:26.445 --> 16:29.823
Can it be more of
an internal struggle?

16:31.742 --> 16:33.410
I need to see it.

16:34.620 --> 16:37.623
While I'm gone,
don't breathe on my pillow.

16:38.957 --> 16:40.584
How about if
I just don't breathe at all?

16:40.834 --> 16:42.419
That's my girl.

16:50.260 --> 16:51.929
What on Earth?

17:05.609 --> 17:06.902
What is going on?

17:07.111 --> 17:08.654
Oh. Hey, Sheldon!

17:10.072 --> 17:13.325
We turned your room
into a sex dungeon! Oh!

17:15.661 --> 17:17.371
- No!
- What is it?

17:22.543 --> 17:26.171
Okay, last question.
The chaps he was wearing, assless?

17:28.132 --> 17:30.801
Can we just focus
on the decision I'm facing?

17:31.093 --> 17:34.346
We can. But for the record,
all chaps are assless.

17:36.473 --> 17:39.810
Gentlemen, please!
This is a significant decision.

17:40.018 --> 17:42.646
Now, do Amy and I
continue living together

17:42.855 --> 17:44.940
or do I move back in with Leonard?

17:45.232 --> 17:47.067
Over my assless chaps, you will.

17:49.069 --> 17:50.487
This isn't complicated.

17:51.321 --> 17:53.073
- Do you love Amy?
- Yes.

17:53.323 --> 17:55.868
- Do you like living with her?
- Yes.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.078
Do you know what you need to do now?

17:59.329 --> 18:02.249
Apparently figure this out on my own
'cause you guys are no help at all.

18:22.060 --> 18:23.103
Hi.

18:24.104 --> 18:25.105
Hello.

18:25.898 --> 18:27.274
What are you doing?

18:28.525 --> 18:31.862
I'm just contemplating
Buridan's donkey.

18:32.488 --> 18:34.156
I understand. I'll leave you be.

18:37.201 --> 18:39.369
What?
You're familiar with the reference?

18:39.661 --> 18:40.829
Of course.

18:41.038 --> 18:44.041
Jean Buridan proposed
a philosophical thesis stating

18:44.249 --> 18:47.419
that a hungry donkey placed between
two equidistant bales of hay

18:47.711 --> 18:50.672
would be paralyzed by indecision
and would starve to death.

18:55.636 --> 18:57.054
Exactly.

18:58.514 --> 19:01.308
I wouldn't want you
to starve to death, so,

19:02.059 --> 19:03.769
here's an eggplant.

19:06.563 --> 19:07.898
Thank you.

19:08.649 --> 19:12.653
You know, some people believe that
Buridan was plagiarizing Aristotle.

19:13.612 --> 19:14.613
Really?

19:14.863 --> 19:16.740
Although, in Aristotle's example

19:16.907 --> 19:19.368
he proposed an equally hungry
and thirsty man

19:19.576 --> 19:20.786
caught between food and drink.

19:21.453 --> 19:24.915
Oh. Yeah, I wonder if that's
related to the 12th-century

19:25.165 --> 19:26.875
Persian philosopher, Al-Ghazali

19:27.084 --> 19:30.254
and his story of a man
caught between two dates.

19:30.754 --> 19:33.131
Are you suggesting
Al-Ghazali was an Aristotelian?

19:33.423 --> 19:36.176
'Cause if anything,
he was anti-Aristotelian.

19:37.803 --> 19:40.597
Al-Ghazali was anti-Aristotelian?

19:41.306 --> 19:43.559
Boy! You think you know a guy.

19:49.565 --> 19:53.694
Okay, open your eyes
and see your new room.

19:58.323 --> 20:00.033
Wow.

20:01.159 --> 20:03.620
I know I went a little overboard.
We can always dial it back.

20:03.871 --> 20:05.080
No, no! No, no, no!

20:05.289 --> 20:07.291
It's important to me that
you have the bedroom you want.

20:07.499 --> 20:10.711
- Oh, that means so much. I love you.
- I love you, too.

20:14.339 --> 20:16.758
Just hiding some stuff
in your closet, don't tell Penny.

20:47.414 --> 20:48.415
