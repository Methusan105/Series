WEBVTT

00:04.339 --> 00:07.050
There was water everywhere,
it was such a mess.

00:07.217 --> 00:09.177
That stinks.
How long are you out of the apartment?

00:09.344 --> 00:10.345
About five weeks.

00:10.553 --> 00:11.888
Ugh!
Did you lose anything valuable?

00:12.055 --> 00:14.516
Well, the pipe was over my closet,
so all my clothes are gone.

00:14.683 --> 00:16.101
Oh, so, nothing. Great.

00:18.019 --> 00:20.647
- Do they know why the pipe burst?
- They didn't say.

00:20.939 --> 00:24.025
Buildings that have a combination
of copper and galvanized steel

00:24.192 --> 00:26.569
are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion

00:26.736 --> 00:29.280
caused by the mobility of ions
in the water.

00:32.784 --> 00:35.412
Can't have your head shoved
in a toilet as much as I did

00:35.578 --> 00:37.789
and not pick up a few things
about plumbing.

00:39.582 --> 00:42.001
Well, if you need a place to crash,
you can stay with us.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.294
Really?

00:43.545 --> 00:46.464
Of course, you can stay in Leonard's room
and we'll stay at my place.

00:46.631 --> 00:49.342
- You sure that's not an inconvenience?
- No, not at all.

00:49.759 --> 00:51.052
And we live with Sheldon,

00:51.219 --> 00:53.722
so the word inconvenience
has really lost all meaning.

00:56.099 --> 00:59.269
So, technically I'd be moving in
with my boyfriend?

00:59.436 --> 01:02.856
I guess so. And I finally get to
live alone with my husband.

01:03.815 --> 01:05.608
Oh, my, this is a big step.

01:06.067 --> 01:07.861
Mmm-hmm. For two of us,
it's in the right direction.

01:13.283 --> 01:15.452
Why are you all smiling like crazy people?

01:43.563 --> 01:47.859
Cohabitation with my girlfriend?
That's a great deal to process.

01:48.151 --> 01:51.154
- Mmm. It's only for five weeks.
- Yeah, and we'll be right across the hall.

01:51.321 --> 01:52.655
What do you think?

01:52.822 --> 01:57.202
I don't know, what if living together
kills the romance?

01:59.579 --> 02:04.083
Okay, you guys had sex one whole time.
Nothing can put out a fire like that.

02:05.919 --> 02:08.379
Yeah, but what happens when we
each get a peek behind the curtain?

02:08.546 --> 02:11.466
I mean, she...
She's never even seen me unshaven!

02:12.550 --> 02:14.803
You just shaved yesterday,
you're good for three months.

02:16.387 --> 02:20.225
Sheldon, I understand your apprehension,
but let me appeal to the scientist in you.

02:20.391 --> 02:21.893
Given the five-week end date,

02:22.060 --> 02:25.063
isn't it the perfect opportunity
to consider this an experiment

02:25.230 --> 02:26.856
and collect data on our compatibility?

02:27.232 --> 02:29.234
Don't try luring me in with sexy talk.

02:31.236 --> 02:33.321
Okay, <i>Star Trek</i>, the original series.

02:33.488 --> 02:36.074
The <i>Enterprise</i> was on a five-year mission
to explore new worlds.

02:36.241 --> 02:39.744
Think of this as your personal
five-week mission to do the same.

02:40.370 --> 02:43.706
Well, if you want to lure me in
with sexy talk, that's how you do it.

02:45.500 --> 02:47.335
Don't be proud of that.

02:49.295 --> 02:50.463
So, is that a yes?

02:50.630 --> 02:51.923
Not yet. I...

02:52.382 --> 02:55.051
How will I learn
if I'm comfortable living with Amy,

02:55.218 --> 02:57.303
or just comfortable
because I'm in my own apartment?

02:57.470 --> 03:01.432
You know, if this experiment is going to
be valid, I suggest a neutral environment.

03:01.599 --> 03:02.684
Well, where would you go?

03:02.851 --> 03:06.604
Well, ideally, an enclosed,
self-sustaining biodome in New Mexico,

03:08.273 --> 03:10.984
where we would eat crops
fertilized with our own waste.

03:13.570 --> 03:15.989
And you were worried about the romance.

03:17.073 --> 03:20.285
Okay, why don't you guys stay
across the hall and we will live here?

03:20.785 --> 03:24.831
Interesting. If my official residence
were across the hall,

03:25.164 --> 03:28.042
I wonder if I'd need to knock
every time I came over here.

03:29.460 --> 03:32.046
That's a good question.
Maybe just don't come over.

03:34.591 --> 03:37.135
You know, historically,
I don't do well with change.

03:37.302 --> 03:40.471
Okay, it won't be that bad. We wouldn't
even sit in your spot while you're gone.

03:40.805 --> 03:42.056
You're darn right, you wouldn't.

03:42.223 --> 03:44.642
No matter where I am,
this will always be my spot.

03:44.809 --> 03:46.394
Like an embassy in a foreign country,

03:46.561 --> 03:49.314
this seat is the sovereign soil
of my bottom.

03:51.316 --> 03:53.151
Just nod and smile, he's almost gone.

03:55.987 --> 03:57.572
Sheldon, what do you think?

04:00.116 --> 04:02.577
- Very well, I'm on board.
- Seriously?

04:02.744 --> 04:06.581
Yes. I accept this five-week mission to
share a living space with my girlfriend.

04:06.789 --> 04:08.082
Oh, this is so exciting.

04:08.249 --> 04:11.836
Well, now don't be surprised if
like <i>Star Trek</i>, it's canceled in three.

04:15.048 --> 04:17.842
I have to say,
I am happy with your OB-GYN.

04:19.510 --> 04:22.555
Cool. 'Cause she says
you're doing a great job as

04:22.722 --> 04:25.600
"Weird friend who doesn't have to be
at every appointment."

04:26.225 --> 04:28.853
I'm the son of a gynecologist.
I could be helpful.

04:29.020 --> 04:32.315
It would help if you stopped telling me
I have a textbook cervix.

04:33.608 --> 04:36.069
The polite response is,
"Thank you for noticing."

04:40.865 --> 04:42.700
Let me see the sonogram again.

04:42.992 --> 04:46.204
Oh, yeah! That's a good-looking baby
for a little gray blob.

04:46.621 --> 04:48.081
Yeah, we could name him Blobert.

04:49.707 --> 04:51.042
What if it's a girl?

04:51.250 --> 04:54.879
Bloberta. Or Blobbi with an "I."

04:56.339 --> 04:58.675
Are we being silly
not finding out the sex?

04:58.841 --> 05:01.052
Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.

05:01.427 --> 05:02.887
If you want, you can find out right now.

05:03.137 --> 05:04.222
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-mmm.

05:04.389 --> 05:06.516
The doctor's gone for the day,
so it doesn't matter.

05:06.724 --> 05:09.435
Or somebody else knows
because they saw it in the folder.

05:09.936 --> 05:12.689
- You looked in our folder?
- It was an accident!

05:12.855 --> 05:16.776
The doctor left the folder on her desk.
It's not my fault I opened it and looked.

05:18.569 --> 05:21.614
So, you know the sex of our baby
and we don't?

05:22.573 --> 05:24.701
Flip a coin, you got a fifty-fifty shot.

05:26.035 --> 05:27.787
- God, Raj!
- That's unbelievable!

05:28.037 --> 05:29.747
But this is not a problem, okay?

05:29.914 --> 05:31.791
If you don't wanna know,
I don't have to tell you.

05:32.041 --> 05:33.751
We don't want you to know!

05:33.918 --> 05:35.962
Yeah, okay, well, that's a problem.

05:39.507 --> 05:41.801
You know, I'm very proud of you
for trying to live with Amy.

05:41.968 --> 05:43.261
- Oh, thank you.
- Mmm.

05:43.428 --> 05:46.180
Of course, the ideal way
to conduct this experiment would be

05:46.347 --> 05:49.183
with four pairs of identical
Sheldons and Amys.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.853
You know, one pair that was
neither dating nor living together,

05:52.020 --> 05:54.272
one pair that was dating
but not living together,

05:54.439 --> 05:56.024
one pair that was living together
but not dating,

05:56.190 --> 05:58.735
and then, of course one pair
that was living together and dating.

05:59.193 --> 06:03.031
Although, with that many Sheldons it'd be
such a party we'd never get anything done.

06:04.615 --> 06:06.451
That was a cute story. So, um...

06:08.828 --> 06:09.954
What did you wanna ask me?

06:10.121 --> 06:13.291
Well, you've lived with
your significant other for some time.

06:13.458 --> 06:17.962
I would like this experiment to go well.
Are there any insights you can share?

06:18.421 --> 06:21.883
Mmm. Well, the biggie is,
if she has an insane roommate,

06:22.050 --> 06:23.634
kick him out as soon as possible.

06:25.470 --> 06:28.056
You know, Leonard and I were very happy
before you came along.

06:30.016 --> 06:33.227
You've been roommates with Sheldon
forever. Do you have any advice?

06:35.229 --> 06:38.149
I'm trying to think of an answer
that won't stop you from doing this.

06:39.650 --> 06:42.320
I know it sounds like a cliche,
but compromise is key.

06:42.487 --> 06:46.491
Never leave a belt on the floor.
At night, they look like snakes.

06:46.991 --> 06:49.535
Do little things,
like bring her a cup of coffee in bed.

06:49.702 --> 06:52.747
Keep M&Ms in your pocket in case
you have to wait in a long line.

06:54.707 --> 06:58.336
You're gonna be seeing each other a lot,
so respect each other's personal space.

06:58.503 --> 07:02.799
He startles easily.
So please, no flash photography.

07:06.969 --> 07:09.639
How many pairs of underwear
did you pack for the move?

07:10.431 --> 07:12.016
I don't know, I didn't count.

07:12.266 --> 07:15.103
You truly are
the Goofus to my Gallant.

07:17.522 --> 07:19.023
That's me. Listen...

07:21.567 --> 07:23.444
You and I are going to be sharing a bed.

07:23.986 --> 07:26.572
You know, this is uncharted territory
for both of us.

07:26.948 --> 07:28.074
How are you feeling about that?

07:28.991 --> 07:32.495
Excited, concerned,
a little scared,

07:32.787 --> 07:35.540
all the same emotions
I feel in line at Space Mountain.

07:38.543 --> 07:40.878
Well, if you're nervous
about the sleeping arrangements,

07:41.045 --> 07:42.380
maybe we should talk about it.

07:43.589 --> 07:44.632
Okay...

07:48.386 --> 07:49.428
Talk.

07:50.513 --> 07:54.725
Well, I imagine one of your concerns
might be coital expectations.

07:54.892 --> 07:57.270
Wow, no foreplay or anything,
just right to it.

07:59.105 --> 08:03.025
Look, I know this experiment is
a big step outside of your comfort zone.

08:03.192 --> 08:08.156
So, why don't we take being physical
off the table, and maybe later on,

08:08.447 --> 08:11.159
once we're more settled in,
we can revisit it.

08:12.535 --> 08:13.995
You're really okay with that?

08:14.245 --> 08:17.331
I've never lived with someone, either.
This is a lot for me, too.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.209
This is such a relief.

08:20.918 --> 08:24.172
I mean, honestly, if it didn't get you
all worked up I'd kiss you right now.

08:27.341 --> 08:30.636
Good call, seeing your Teen Titans
underwear really got my motor running.

08:32.180 --> 08:34.557
I know, they probably shouldn't
sell those to children.

08:38.311 --> 08:40.438
- Well, here's your key.
- Thank you.

08:40.813 --> 08:42.773
Enjoy having the place to yourselves.

08:43.107 --> 08:46.319
You enjoy your mission to boldly go
where no man has gone before.

08:49.155 --> 08:52.116
It's Penny's bedroom,
plenty of men have gone before.

08:55.453 --> 08:58.748
Now, now, there's no need
to make this emotional.

08:59.665 --> 09:00.958
Shall we?

09:02.210 --> 09:03.461
I guess this is it.

09:03.836 --> 09:04.921
You guys have fun.

09:05.087 --> 09:06.130
You, too.

09:09.717 --> 09:12.511
Oh, don't forget! Tuesday, the air filters
need to be changed.

09:12.678 --> 09:14.597
Yeah, you wrote it on my hand.

09:17.975 --> 09:20.686
Oh, and every other day,
check the water level on the avocado pit.

09:20.853 --> 09:24.482
I'm on it. 15 years from now,
we'll make guacamole together.

09:25.191 --> 09:26.817
Leonard, please, let me go.

09:32.448 --> 09:34.075
Come on, Sheldon.

09:35.201 --> 09:36.285
Bye.

09:36.827 --> 09:38.454
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

09:43.417 --> 09:46.754
That's it. For the next five weeks
we are officially living together.

09:47.171 --> 09:49.173
I guess the experiment begins.

09:49.340 --> 09:51.634
<i>- Whoo-hoo! We did it!
- Yeah!</i>

09:58.474 --> 10:00.518
Which side of the bed would you prefer?

10:00.685 --> 10:02.103
Doesn't matter to me, your choice.

10:02.270 --> 10:05.147
No, no, we're living together now,
everything is equal.

10:05.523 --> 10:07.191
I know that I have a tendency
to be controlling,

10:07.483 --> 10:08.734
so, I would rather you choose.

10:09.402 --> 10:10.861
Well, Sheldon, I really appreciate that,

10:11.028 --> 10:14.031
but these things mean more to you
than they do to me, so, whatever you want.

10:14.365 --> 10:16.867
Well, clearly it's not whatever I want
because what I want

10:17.034 --> 10:19.912
is for you to make this decision
and you refuse to do that.

10:20.788 --> 10:23.207
I'm not refusing,
I'm just trying to be considerate.

10:23.416 --> 10:25.876
Like when you let me get those shoes
with the wheels on the bottom

10:26.043 --> 10:28.170
and then watched me
roll right into traffic?

10:28.713 --> 10:29.880
Sheldon, will you please just pick a side?

10:30.047 --> 10:31.173
Fine.

10:37.596 --> 10:42.518
All right. Now, on this side I am
closer to the exit in case of emergency.

10:43.728 --> 10:45.479
Great, that's your side.

10:45.646 --> 10:48.649
No, but I'm also closer to the entrance
in case of attack.

10:50.860 --> 10:52.194
Okay, I'll take that side.

10:52.361 --> 10:53.988
Then again, what are the odds
of someone attacking me?

10:54.155 --> 10:55.489
Rising rapidly!

10:58.743 --> 11:02.204
Now, this side offers me
proximity to the bathroom,

11:02.413 --> 11:06.792
but I am closer to the window
where perverts can watch me sleep.

11:08.377 --> 11:11.088
Okay, what if we do this?

11:14.008 --> 11:15.092
I suppose that works.

11:15.468 --> 11:16.552
Great.

11:20.639 --> 11:23.225
Although, now I'm kind of worried
someone's hiding behind those drapes.

11:27.521 --> 11:28.939
This is ridiculous.

11:29.106 --> 11:33.277
The doctor knows what the baby is,
the ultrasound tech knows, Raj knows,

11:33.444 --> 11:36.822
his <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> online fan group
probably knows.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.409
Is it weird we don't?

11:41.160 --> 11:44.789
I dunno, maybe the surprise
will make it more fun.

11:44.955 --> 11:46.123
You know, like magic tricks.

11:46.624 --> 11:50.169
Remember how disappointed you were
when I explained the never-ending hanky?

11:50.461 --> 11:52.922
I was disappointed to see
the man I was engaged to

11:53.089 --> 11:55.257
pulling rainbow scarves out of his fly.

11:58.177 --> 12:02.765
But, how delightful was it when I pulled
out a bouquet at the end of those scarves?

12:04.934 --> 12:08.854
It'll be the same thing when the doctor
pulls a beautiful surprise out of you.

12:11.023 --> 12:12.775
Everyone said I could do better.

12:15.152 --> 12:16.487
Yeah, but you didn't listen,

12:16.654 --> 12:18.948
and presto-chango
my baby's inside you. Ta-da.

12:30.209 --> 12:31.293
<i>Ugh! What is that?</i>

12:40.553 --> 12:41.679
Why did you switch sides?

12:41.929 --> 12:43.806
Be grateful I'm still in the room.

12:51.480 --> 12:52.523
Comfy?

12:52.690 --> 12:56.861
Oh, I'm just happy I don't know
what this memory foam remembers.

12:57.570 --> 13:01.657
Sheldon, I know we took coitus
off the table, but I was wondering

13:01.824 --> 13:05.202
how you feel about other forms
of intimacy, such as snuggling?

13:05.703 --> 13:09.623
Well, it's funny you should ask,
because I was wondering how you'd feel

13:09.790 --> 13:12.877
about separating the two of us
with a pillow wall.

13:15.087 --> 13:18.090
Sheldon, I've made more than enough
accommodations for you.

13:18.799 --> 13:22.178
And we're both grown adults,
we've been far more intimate than this.

13:22.344 --> 13:25.181
If you don't wanna snuggle, fine,
but we're not building a pillow wall.

13:25.347 --> 13:26.724
I am sorry.

13:26.891 --> 13:30.895
I'm just worried that my sensitivity to
temperature could make this a rough night.

13:31.061 --> 13:33.397
And, no offense,
but your bottom radiates enough heat,

13:33.564 --> 13:35.232
I'm surprised
there aren't iguanas lying on it.

13:40.404 --> 13:43.657
That's it, it's Sheldon's bedtime.
He is in for the night.

13:44.408 --> 13:47.244
Wow. I cannot believe we are alone
in our own apartment.

13:47.411 --> 13:48.496
<i>It's weird.</i>

13:48.746 --> 13:51.916
This must be how parents feel
when their kid goes off to college.

13:53.709 --> 13:55.920
Unless they feel sad, then it's different.

13:57.046 --> 13:58.339
So, what do you wanna do?

13:59.131 --> 14:01.842
I know exactly what we are gonna do.

14:02.468 --> 14:05.763
Really? You're a genius and
that's the first thing you come up with?

14:07.389 --> 14:08.766
Hey, Sheldon's not here,

14:08.933 --> 14:12.269
so we are going to put on music
and dance in our underwear.

14:14.438 --> 14:16.273
Ugh! Can we just have sex?

14:18.400 --> 14:22.905
Oh, don't worry, once you see
my sweet moves, sex is inevitable.

14:41.590 --> 14:43.050
Inevitable, you say?

14:44.969 --> 14:46.637
I'll just let my hips do the talking.

14:53.978 --> 14:56.855
- Screw it, I'm calling and finding out.
- Good, call him.

15:01.443 --> 15:02.736
Wait, I'm not sure I wanna know.

15:02.987 --> 15:06.615
- But, you just said you wanted to know.
- Well, now I don't know if I wanna know!

15:07.908 --> 15:09.827
- Hello?
- Call you back.

15:12.246 --> 15:17.167
No, Dr. Feynman, if I solve it for you,
you'll never learn.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.014
Wow, where did you learn these moves?

15:30.180 --> 15:32.808
Well, the world may have forgotten
about Dance Dance Revolution,

15:32.975 --> 15:34.059
but not this Smooth Criminal.

15:38.355 --> 15:41.066
- Okay, you're positive you wanna know?
- Yes.

15:41.692 --> 15:44.278
Here we go. It's ringing.

15:48.449 --> 15:49.825
- Hello?
- Wait.

15:50.075 --> 15:51.118
Wrong number!

15:55.456 --> 15:57.166
Harr...

16:00.586 --> 16:02.296
Harr...

16:06.050 --> 16:07.760
Harr...

16:11.013 --> 16:12.723
Harr...

16:15.059 --> 16:16.769
Harr...

16:24.568 --> 16:26.195
Harr...

16:30.324 --> 16:31.950
I told you not to do the worm.

16:34.703 --> 16:35.913
You were right.

16:41.251 --> 16:42.252
Hello?

16:42.419 --> 16:43.921
<i>I changed my mind,
hang up, hang up!</i>

17:01.021 --> 17:02.231
Oh.

17:13.075 --> 17:15.285
- What are you doing down there?
- Hang on.

17:15.661 --> 17:16.704
Who are you calling?

17:27.339 --> 17:30.175
I'm so sore, I don't think
I slept two minutes last night.

17:36.306 --> 17:37.808
Yeah, get it, girl.

17:40.686 --> 17:42.104
It's not what you think.

17:42.980 --> 17:46.275
I feel like I pulled something,
why didn't you tell me to stop?

17:48.152 --> 17:49.987
Even more not what you think.

17:51.739 --> 17:54.491
I don't know if I can make it through
five weeks living with him.

17:54.825 --> 17:55.951
If you ever need a break,

17:56.118 --> 17:59.079
the owner of the train store will let you
leave him there while you get a coffee.

17:59.246 --> 18:00.330
Yeah.

18:01.206 --> 18:02.499
Good morning.

18:02.833 --> 18:04.626
Yeah, I didn't knock, but it's fine.

18:04.793 --> 18:06.837
I didn't knock, but it's fine.
I didn't knock, but it's fine.

18:08.505 --> 18:11.675
- So, how is everyone?
- Miserable and exhausted.

18:12.176 --> 18:13.969
Really? I slept great.

18:15.179 --> 18:17.014
Well, I didn't and it's your fault.

18:17.306 --> 18:19.683
How? You had the whole floor to yourself.

18:22.811 --> 18:25.564
Sheldon, maybe living together
is a bad idea.

18:26.565 --> 18:28.525
Yeah, but what kind of
scientists would we be,

18:28.692 --> 18:31.278
drawing a conclusion
after only 12 hours of data?

18:31.528 --> 18:34.698
The kind who almost put a
pillow over your face last night.

18:36.825 --> 18:40.204
Wow, I anticipated we'd have problems,

18:40.412 --> 18:43.457
but I never thought your scientific rigor
would be one of them.

18:43.832 --> 18:46.752
I'm sorry, are you questioning
my integrity as a scientist?

18:46.919 --> 18:49.755
If the lab room
disposable shoe cover fits.

18:52.049 --> 18:53.217
- Was that a science diss?
- Yeah.

18:53.383 --> 18:54.384
- Was it a good one?
- Eh.

18:54.593 --> 18:55.594
Mmm.

18:56.595 --> 19:00.140
What would a theoretical physicist
understand about an experiment anyway?

19:00.307 --> 19:01.934
I mean, you wouldn't know
a confounding variable

19:02.100 --> 19:04.394
if two of them hit you in the face
at the same time.

19:06.563 --> 19:07.689
And you don't even get that joke

19:07.856 --> 19:09.566
'cause you don't even work
with confounding variables!

19:12.069 --> 19:13.278
How dare you.

19:13.445 --> 19:16.573
Oh, you heard me.
Your experimental bonafides are laughable.

19:16.865 --> 19:19.368
Whoa, whoa, now you're making fun
of my bonafides?

19:20.410 --> 19:22.287
Can't make fun of something
that's a null set.

19:24.790 --> 19:26.333
- I feel like I should say "damn."
- Do it.

19:26.500 --> 19:27.584
Damn!

19:28.919 --> 19:31.922
Well, if you are so protective
of the scientific method,

19:32.089 --> 19:34.925
perhaps we should use the next five weeks
to finish what we started.

19:35.092 --> 19:36.927
Well, for science, maybe I will!

19:37.094 --> 19:38.512
Yeah, for science, maybe you should!

19:38.679 --> 19:40.264
- Fine! Good!
- Fine! Great!

19:41.598 --> 19:43.100
You wanna go to our place and make out?

19:43.267 --> 19:44.768
Does Stephen Hawking
roll through the quad?

19:52.651 --> 19:54.152
The new neighbors are weird.

20:24.474 --> 20:25.475
English - SDH
