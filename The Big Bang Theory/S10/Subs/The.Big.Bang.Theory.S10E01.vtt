00:02.003 --> 00:03.546
<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

00:03.755 --> 00:05.298
Dad, this is Sheldon's mother, Mary.

00:05.465 --> 00:07.258
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

00:07.425 --> 00:10.261
- And, of course, Mom.
- Hello, my hateful shrew.

00:11.304 --> 00:14.265
Hello to you, you wrinkled old bastard.

00:16.518 --> 00:20.021
Hey! I just got an email
from the US Air Force.

00:20.522 --> 00:23.775
I'm just afraid, if I respond,
then they'll know I got it.

00:24.109 --> 00:26.736
Dude, the minute you opened that email,
they knew you got it.

00:26.986 --> 00:30.323
I mean, they're probably looking at you
through the camera right now.

00:31.491 --> 00:34.202
Oh, God, I think someone's following us.

00:36.371 --> 00:38.289
Turn left here,
and see if he turns with us.

00:38.540 --> 00:40.458
Why is he turning here?
The restaurant's the other way.

00:40.625 --> 00:43.878
I don't know, he uses that traffic app.
Maybe there's an accident.

00:44.170 --> 00:45.338
So, follow him.

00:46.631 --> 00:48.133
Oh, no!

00:49.342 --> 00:51.678
Leonard, if you don't mind,
I think I'm a little tired.

00:51.928 --> 00:53.805
- I'm gonna call it a night.
- Sure, Dad.

00:54.055 --> 00:58.059
I'm a little tuckered out myself,
I will see you all in the morning.

00:59.185 --> 01:01.312
- Would you like to share a cab?
- That would be fine.

01:01.479 --> 01:03.148
- Where are you staying?
- I'm at the Westin.

01:03.314 --> 01:05.608
Well, so am I.
Could I interest you in a nightcap?

01:05.775 --> 01:07.318
I think that you could.

01:12.490 --> 01:13.658
<i>Leonard?</i>

01:15.994 --> 01:17.120
<i>Leonard?</i>

01:18.079 --> 01:19.122
What?

01:19.330 --> 01:21.875
<i>You realize,
you and I could become brothers.</i>

01:23.752 --> 01:26.671
We're not gonna be brothers,
we're not gonna be stepbrothers.

01:26.838 --> 01:28.089
Go to sleep.

01:28.673 --> 01:30.049
I hope you're right.

01:30.216 --> 01:34.471
'Cause a grown man living with his
brother and his brother's wife is weird.

01:36.222 --> 01:38.933
- Go to sleep.
- <i>OKay.</i>

01:42.395 --> 01:45.607
<i>Do you think your father is doing
unspeakable things to my mother?</i>

01:47.317 --> 01:48.443
No.

01:49.027 --> 01:51.905
Are you saying that
because the things are unspeakable?

01:52.071 --> 01:56.284
Your parents are old, anything unspeakable
was finished by 9:30. Go to sleep!

01:58.203 --> 01:59.245
Very well.

02:01.706 --> 02:04.626
I'm sorry if this stuff is gonna make
the ceremony awkward.

02:04.793 --> 02:06.419
God, I thought my brother,
fresh out of jail

02:06.586 --> 02:08.588
was gonna make everyone uncomfortable,
but now this...

02:08.755 --> 02:11.925
<i>Hey, if you want me to sleep,
you're going to have to stop talking.</i>

02:38.284 --> 02:39.577
Okay, I'm gonna go pick up my family.

02:39.786 --> 02:41.871
Like, an hour and half, two hours,
depending on traffic.

02:42.038 --> 02:44.374
- Yeah, drive safe.
- Okay, and do yourself a favor, all right?

02:44.541 --> 02:47.627
When Beverly gets here,
do not bring up last night. All right?

02:47.794 --> 02:50.755
As far as you're concerned,
you don't know anything,

02:50.922 --> 02:54.843
you didn't see anything,
I want you just to play dumb.

02:56.636 --> 02:59.514
It was nice of her to show us
"playing dumb" with an example.

02:59.681 --> 03:01.599
What? Oh!

03:02.600 --> 03:04.727
Hi. Okay. Hey, there.
I'm sorry, I gotta go now.

03:04.894 --> 03:06.521
- Penny, wait.
- Why?

03:08.523 --> 03:11.442
I wanted to thank you for going through
all the trouble of planning

03:11.609 --> 03:13.778
a second wedding ceremony for me.

03:14.028 --> 03:16.281
But unfortunately, I cannot attend.

03:16.823 --> 03:18.241
Why? What's wrong?

03:18.616 --> 03:21.578
Are we still doing the dumb thing?
Okay. Why, what's wrong?

03:22.161 --> 03:26.124
I just cannot stay here, while your father
goes out of his way to humiliate me.

03:26.499 --> 03:28.793
Oh, golly!
However did he humiliate you?

03:29.794 --> 03:31.129
Stop it, Sheldon.

03:31.462 --> 03:33.965
Do I say "stop what"
or just throw in the towel?

03:34.716 --> 03:37.468
I don't see why I should have to watch
your father parade around

03:37.635 --> 03:39.554
with some Bible-thumping bumpkin.

03:39.721 --> 03:44.309
Excuse me! That is my mother
you're talking about, however accurately.

03:45.101 --> 03:46.936
Okay. Beverly,
aren't you overreacting a little?

03:47.103 --> 03:49.314
All we know is
they shared a cab and had a nightcap.

03:49.480 --> 03:52.025
- And turned their phones off.
- Not helping, buddy.

03:53.985 --> 03:57.113
Mother, Penny and I really
want you to be part of this. Please stay?

03:57.280 --> 04:00.992
Yeah, plus, if you leave,
Alfred will know he got under your skin.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.580
Well, we can't have that.

04:07.498 --> 04:10.960
Also, if they did have coitus, we'll
all be needing a skilled psychiatrist.

04:14.923 --> 04:16.716
It is funny when you think about it.

04:16.883 --> 04:19.886
Maybe to you,
you didn't get a $500 traffic ticket.

04:20.678 --> 04:22.805
Because you were driving like a lunatic.

04:23.014 --> 04:27.060
Hey, if thinking secret government agents
are chasing you makes you a lunatic,

04:27.226 --> 04:28.853
then, yeah, okay.

04:31.940 --> 04:33.232
Oh, I'll get it.

04:34.567 --> 04:36.069
It didn't help
that you couldn't walk a straight line

04:36.319 --> 04:37.987
when the cop pulled you over.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.699
I have performance anxiety.

04:43.368 --> 04:45.078
You of all people should know that.

04:55.922 --> 04:57.006
Hello.

04:57.924 --> 04:59.717
I'm looking for a Howard Wolowitz.

05:00.802 --> 05:02.804
Howard Wolowitz?

05:03.972 --> 05:06.057
I have the right address, don't I?

05:07.225 --> 05:08.226
Address?

05:09.310 --> 05:10.436
Is he here?

05:11.521 --> 05:13.189
Uh, no.

05:14.565 --> 05:16.317
Do you know where I can find him?

05:16.943 --> 05:19.988
- May I ask what this is about?
- No, you may not.

05:20.405 --> 05:22.240
Very well.

05:26.869 --> 05:29.038
- Have him call me.
- Okay.

05:29.914 --> 05:31.541
Raj, who's at the door?

05:33.793 --> 05:36.254
That's not him.

05:39.882 --> 05:43.011
Ah, I can't wait for you to meet everyone.
I told them all about you.

05:43.636 --> 05:46.222
Like what?
Do they know about your brother?

05:46.597 --> 05:49.934
Not everything, just like,
the jail and drugs part.

05:50.810 --> 05:52.478
- Why would you do that?
- What?

05:52.645 --> 05:54.605
The world doesn't need
to know our problems.

05:54.772 --> 05:56.482
- Mom, I'm sorry, but I...
- Hey, look.

05:56.649 --> 05:58.359
They got Walgreens here, too.

06:00.194 --> 06:02.613
You really think it's helpful
to change the subject, Wyatt?

06:02.780 --> 06:04.741
Just trying
to make this a happy trip, dear.

06:04.907 --> 06:06.117
Well, quit it!

06:09.662 --> 06:11.664
Oh, uh, Randall, can't believe
after all these years,

06:11.831 --> 06:13.583
you finally get to visit me in California.

06:13.750 --> 06:15.626
Well, good thing
I was a nonviolent offender.

06:15.793 --> 06:17.920
Otherwise, I couldn't have left the state.

06:19.505 --> 06:21.716
All right, that's enough jail talk.

06:22.133 --> 06:24.844
Penny knows where I was,
she sent me cigarettes.

06:25.136 --> 06:26.721
You sent your brother cigarettes?

06:26.888 --> 06:29.265
He was cooking
and selling crystal meth, Susan.

06:29.432 --> 06:31.684
I think we can let the cigarettes slide.

06:32.852 --> 06:34.479
Stop trying to be the cool dad.

06:34.729 --> 06:37.106
You have a shirt
with our cat's picture on it.

06:38.983 --> 06:40.485
Anyway, we're here, slugger.

06:43.613 --> 06:46.157
That's great! Now, they know where I live.

06:46.324 --> 06:48.618
What are you talking about?
They've always known where you live.

06:48.785 --> 06:49.827
Yeah, if you wanna go off the grid,

06:50.036 --> 06:51.537
you have to move out
of your mother's house.

06:53.664 --> 06:57.835
Can we take a moment to discuss that
I just lied to the government for you?

06:58.336 --> 07:01.172
Yeah, I would not have done that for you.

07:02.673 --> 07:04.967
Howard, please just call the man,
see what he wants?

07:05.134 --> 07:06.511
All right, all right.

07:07.845 --> 07:10.807
Hey. Make sure you tell him that
you weren't home when he came by.

07:10.973 --> 07:12.683
And that your Indian friend
gave you the message,

07:12.850 --> 07:14.894
the moment you stepped through the door.

07:16.020 --> 07:18.231
Yes, hello.

07:18.397 --> 07:21.776
This is Howard Wolowitz,
for Colonel Richard Williams.

07:22.026 --> 07:23.194
I take it back, don't mention me.

07:23.361 --> 07:26.280
Hi, Colonel Williams. How can I help you?

07:27.156 --> 07:30.034
What? Yes, he is from India.

07:32.120 --> 07:35.206
No, I don't know his immigration status.

07:38.126 --> 07:39.794
Relax, I'm still on hold!

07:43.005 --> 07:44.006
Speaking.

07:45.633 --> 07:48.719
Okay, sure,
I can meet with you on Thursday.

07:49.011 --> 07:52.890
Caltech is fine.
Yeah, and may I ask what this is about?

07:54.350 --> 07:55.476
I may not?

07:56.352 --> 07:57.979
That's what he said to me.

08:00.606 --> 08:02.400
- Here you are, Mother.
- Thank you.

08:03.067 --> 08:04.694
I'm glad you decided to stay.

08:05.403 --> 08:07.905
It's gonna be special for Penny and me
to share this with you.

08:08.072 --> 08:10.408
I can't wait for this day to be over.

08:12.869 --> 08:14.495
Yeah, special, like that.

08:15.872 --> 08:18.166
That's them.

08:18.457 --> 08:21.460
Please don't make things any more awkward
than they already are.

08:21.794 --> 08:24.714
Right, so,
less or equally awkward, got it.

08:26.757 --> 08:28.759
- Hey, guys. Come on in.
- Thank you.

08:28.926 --> 08:29.969
- Good morning.
- Morning.

08:30.136 --> 08:32.388
- Hello.
- How is everyone today?

08:32.680 --> 08:34.932
- Good, and you?
- Good, good.

08:35.141 --> 08:36.767
- Good.
- I'm good, too.

08:37.101 --> 08:38.186
Good.

08:41.981 --> 08:43.858
So, did you defile my mother, or not?

08:45.985 --> 08:48.946
Sheldon! You're being rude.

08:49.197 --> 08:52.325
If I may, I can assure you,
your mother and I did nothing more

08:52.491 --> 08:54.785
than share a cab and a conversation.

08:55.411 --> 08:58.956
Did that conversation include the phrase,
"Your genitals are a joy to behold"?

08:59.123 --> 09:01.125
That's enough!

09:01.542 --> 09:05.421
Look, I promise you, neither I,
nor anyone has ever said that.

09:07.173 --> 09:09.342
You don't know his girlfriend very well.

09:10.927 --> 09:13.304
Or what a joy it is
to behold my genitals.

09:16.557 --> 09:18.351
All right, you guys, get settled in.

09:18.517 --> 09:20.394
Then, we'll go across the hall,
and say hi to everyone.

09:20.561 --> 09:23.022
You know, it's hard to believe
I've never met Leonard.

09:23.189 --> 09:26.817
Well, he probably buys his illegal drugs
from a local vendor.

09:28.694 --> 09:31.489
- Not funny, Wyatt.
- I thought it was really funny.

09:31.656 --> 09:32.657
Thanks.

09:32.823 --> 09:35.701
Well, fine. If everyone wants
to make jokes about our problems,

09:35.868 --> 09:37.828
then, I can, too. Knock-knock.

09:37.995 --> 09:40.915
Who's there?
Our family is an embarrassment.

09:42.166 --> 09:43.501
That's not much of a joke.

09:43.668 --> 09:45.878
Okay. Listen, Mom, I know you're nervous,

09:46.045 --> 09:49.006
but I promise you, no one
is going to judge you, or this family.

09:49.173 --> 09:50.508
I'm sorry.

09:50.675 --> 09:53.052
It's just we're meeting Leonard's parents
for the first time.

09:53.219 --> 09:54.887
And they're academics,

09:55.054 --> 09:58.641
and intellectuals, and I don't
want them thinking we're white trash.

10:00.226 --> 10:02.853
Well, what color trash
do you think they'll believe?

10:05.815 --> 10:09.110
How could you think that I would spend
the night with a man I just met?

10:09.360 --> 10:12.196
A man named Jesus
convinced you to build a church in Africa.

10:12.363 --> 10:13.781
You're kind of a sucker.

10:16.033 --> 10:18.202
Well, nothing happened. Right?

10:18.369 --> 10:20.121
It's over,
until we get married a third time,

10:20.288 --> 10:22.748
you guys will never have
to see each other again.

10:23.082 --> 10:24.875
Well, you know,
actually that's not the case.

10:25.042 --> 10:27.003
Mary may visit me in New York.

10:27.503 --> 10:29.130
And he's never been to Texas.

10:29.463 --> 10:30.840
Maybe we meet halfway.

10:31.048 --> 10:34.093
What? In the
Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia?

10:36.137 --> 10:38.681
I can't be the only one
that knows that's halfway.

10:40.558 --> 10:42.476
You're not seriously
going to visit each other?

10:42.727 --> 10:43.728
And why wouldn't we?

10:43.894 --> 10:45.730
Oh, please, you're just saying this
to antagonize me.

10:45.980 --> 10:48.482
Not at all.
Mary happens to be a wonderful woman.

10:48.649 --> 10:51.068
And if it antagonizes you,
that's just a bonus.

10:53.571 --> 10:55.406
Mary, I'm sorry
you're in the middle of this.

10:55.614 --> 10:59.910
No, no. Nothing to be sorry about,
I genuinely like your father.

11:00.286 --> 11:02.330
But he's a mediocre academic.

11:02.496 --> 11:06.083
And, according to Beverly,
his sexual prowess is subpar.

11:07.585 --> 11:10.004
He's basically Leonard
with a bigger prostate.

11:13.007 --> 11:16.218
Are you saying that my dad's
not good enough for your mom?

11:16.469 --> 11:19.764
Yes, while also getting in a solid dig
at you, pretty efficient, huh?

11:21.098 --> 11:24.226
I can't even... This is ridiculous.
I'm going across the hall.

11:24.393 --> 11:27.021
Why should you get to go and leave
me here with your bickering parents?

11:27.188 --> 11:28.189
Fine, then you go.

11:28.439 --> 11:30.441
Well, I don't want to stay here
with her, I'll go.

11:30.691 --> 11:32.443
- I'll go with you.
- That still leaves me here with him.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.070
Hang on, hang on.

11:34.236 --> 11:36.572
We're smart, we can figure this out.
Okay, so,

11:36.947 --> 11:39.450
Mary and Beverly can't be together.

11:39.909 --> 11:42.286
Alfred and Beverly can't be together.

11:42.453 --> 11:44.789
Leonard and I can't be together.

11:44.955 --> 11:48.918
Now, I could be with Alfred,
but I don't like his face.

11:51.003 --> 11:52.129
Here, I've got it!

11:52.296 --> 11:53.964
Who's ready for a wedding?

11:54.131 --> 11:56.092
Great, now I have to start all over.

12:01.639 --> 12:03.766
So, how's the world of pharmaceuticals
treating you?

12:03.933 --> 12:06.894
Pretty good. I actually just
got assigned a much better territory.

12:07.311 --> 12:09.313
See what happens when you work hard?

12:09.522 --> 12:12.316
Hey, she just sells drugs,
I had to make them.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.194
Okay, that's enough.

12:15.403 --> 12:17.905
No more drug talk
for the rest of this trip.

12:18.197 --> 12:19.740
I'll drink to that.

12:20.366 --> 12:22.827
- Haven't you had enough?
- Penny drinks more than I do.

12:22.993 --> 12:24.662
Well, I learned from the best.

12:25.704 --> 12:27.248
- Aw!
- Aw!

12:28.624 --> 12:32.503
Very nice, Wyatt. And you wonder why
this one turned out the way he did.

12:32.711 --> 12:34.547
See what I've got to put up with?

12:34.713 --> 12:38.300
What you've got to put up with?
Why did you have to go to jail?

12:38.509 --> 12:40.845
It's called getting caught, Mother!

12:42.555 --> 12:44.473
- Hello.
- Hey, there he is!

12:44.723 --> 12:47.726
Oh, Leonard,
it's so nice to see you again.

12:47.977 --> 12:50.980
You, too.
Everyone, this is my mother, Beverly.

12:51.147 --> 12:52.231
- Hello.
<i>- Hi.</i>

12:52.565 --> 12:54.316
We are not white trash.

12:59.864 --> 13:01.949
Are you excited
to see your son walk down the aisle?

13:02.116 --> 13:05.995
Yes, I am. I'm just feeling a little
guilty about all the trouble I've caused.

13:06.412 --> 13:07.538
Oh, so am I.

13:07.705 --> 13:09.832
You made God sad today, Mom.

13:18.382 --> 13:21.760
Sheldon, they haven't done anything wrong.
I think it's nice they're hitting it off.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.929
That's still no reason
to rush into anything.

13:24.096 --> 13:26.724
I mean, look at us,
we took things remarkably slow.

13:26.891 --> 13:29.727
You and I,
we didn't even hold hands for two years.

13:31.270 --> 13:33.230
It was a lot hotter than it sounds.

13:34.315 --> 13:35.649
Well, you're a patient young lady.

13:35.816 --> 13:38.402
Hey! She's mine,
take a cold shower, Grandpa.

13:42.573 --> 13:44.617
Why wouldn't that Colonel say
what the meeting is about?

13:44.783 --> 13:47.036
- It has to be bad news.
- Yeah, calm down.

13:47.203 --> 13:48.704
Okay? Try not to think about it.

13:49.038 --> 13:53.000
- That's really stupid advice.
- You know that hurts my feelings.

13:53.918 --> 13:55.753
Calm down, try not to think about it.

13:56.879 --> 13:57.880
Okay.

14:00.508 --> 14:02.510
- Why do I bother talking to you?
- Oh, come on.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.553
What's the worst
that could come of this meeting?

14:04.720 --> 14:07.932
I don't know, they take
the invention away and I get nothing.

14:08.349 --> 14:09.683
Okay, that's not so bad.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.853
You know what happened to the scientists
that worked on the Manhattan Project?

14:13.020 --> 14:15.064
The government forced them
to move to the desert.

14:15.231 --> 14:16.565
They had to live in secret.

14:16.732 --> 14:19.235
And when Oppenheimer objected
to what they made him do,

14:19.401 --> 14:21.111
they destroyed his reputation.

14:22.404 --> 14:24.532
What's the point of that story?

14:26.909 --> 14:30.704
Just read a book about Oppenheimer,
seemed like a chance to show off.

14:34.750 --> 14:37.962
There he is,
there's my happy Hebraic homeboy.

14:38.879 --> 14:41.507
Yeah, that's the smile I'm gonna remember
when you're living in the desert,

14:41.799 --> 14:43.425
and I'm living with your wife.

14:47.972 --> 14:49.640
So, what do you do for a living?

14:50.724 --> 14:52.476
Mommy, you wanna take this one?

14:54.061 --> 14:56.272
Um, Randall's in between jobs.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.357
And court appearances.

14:59.942 --> 15:02.945
It's nice to meet the woman
who raised this fine young man.

15:03.279 --> 15:04.905
I'm looking forward to meeting his father.

15:05.155 --> 15:06.824
Prepare to be disappointed.

15:08.117 --> 15:10.536
And he can't wait to meet you, too.
Can I get anyone a drink?

15:10.703 --> 15:13.163
- I could use another beer.
- You're done!

15:15.499 --> 15:16.667
He's done.

15:18.252 --> 15:20.588
Hey! Is everyone
getting to know each other?

15:20.879 --> 15:22.298
Not at all.

15:33.517 --> 15:37.062
Nice to see you again, Dr. Hofstadter,
I'm Leonard's friend, Stuart.

15:37.354 --> 15:38.814
Nice to see you, too.

15:39.523 --> 15:40.566
Hi, I'm Stuart.

15:40.816 --> 15:43.193
Oh, I'm Alfred. Leonard's father.

15:43.527 --> 15:46.614
Oh! Oh, hi! I'm sorry,
did you two wanna sit together?

15:46.864 --> 15:48.032
- No.
- No.

15:51.243 --> 15:53.746
I was wondering why
the front row was available.

15:55.706 --> 15:57.916
Okay, I think we're ready.

16:04.923 --> 16:06.884
Why do people cry at weddings?

16:07.217 --> 16:09.553
They're practicing
for what's coming later.

16:14.975 --> 16:17.895
Thank you for cleaning yourself up
for your sister's wedding.

16:18.312 --> 16:20.564
Thank you for my new teeth.

16:25.569 --> 16:27.071
Welcome to the family, Leonard.

16:27.237 --> 16:29.114
Don't lend your new brother-in-law money.

16:34.662 --> 16:36.914
We're here today to celebrate love.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.503
Sigh louder, no one heard you.

16:44.672 --> 16:46.256
Really, I can move.

16:47.216 --> 16:50.344
Not just Leonard and Penny's love,
but the love we have for them,

16:50.511 --> 16:51.845
as well as each other.

16:52.179 --> 16:56.266
Speaking of love, STDs among
the elderly are skyrocketing.

16:59.144 --> 17:00.312
Love is patient,

17:00.479 --> 17:03.816
but it's not gonna put up with all
the side chatter, so, let's knock it off!

17:06.026 --> 17:07.653
At least she's yelling at someone else
for a change...

17:07.820 --> 17:09.196
<i>Howard!</i>

17:13.492 --> 17:15.369
Okay, I understand
everyone is a little tense today,

17:15.536 --> 17:17.871
so, I am just gonna
get to the important stuff.

17:18.414 --> 17:19.581
Leonard,

17:20.207 --> 17:23.252
standing here with you
in front of our family and friends is

17:23.585 --> 17:25.295
bringing up a lot of feelings.

17:26.255 --> 17:29.299
Like what a good idea it was
to elope the first time.

17:31.593 --> 17:34.763
But also,
how incredibly happy you make me.

17:36.223 --> 17:39.560
Thank you for marrying me.
Hopefully, for the last time.

17:42.771 --> 17:43.814
Penny,

17:44.815 --> 17:48.110
as a scientist, my job is to figure out
why things happen.

17:48.277 --> 17:51.155
But I don't think I'll ever understand

17:51.321 --> 17:55.784
how someone like me
could get to be with someone like you.

17:56.660 --> 17:58.078
You know, maybe,

17:58.829 --> 18:02.416
I don't need to understand it, I just
need to be grateful. I love you, Penny.

18:05.878 --> 18:08.338
Anybody have anything snarky
to say about that?

18:10.841 --> 18:12.009
Didn't think so.

18:13.802 --> 18:16.305
I'd like to say something.

18:16.638 --> 18:20.350
Beverly, I know that
we don't bring out the best in each other,

18:20.976 --> 18:23.854
but something wonderful
did come from our relationship.

18:24.521 --> 18:26.273
That young man, right there.

18:27.483 --> 18:28.734
I couldn't agree more.

18:31.695 --> 18:32.738
That's beautiful.

18:35.532 --> 18:38.660
- Thank you. All right, let's continue.
<i>- Excuse me.</i>

18:39.787 --> 18:43.582
I need to say something
to someone pretty special,

18:43.957 --> 18:46.585
and I just can't wait any longer.

18:47.544 --> 18:49.713
- It's happening.
- Leonard.

18:54.051 --> 18:56.178
You and I have our ups and downs,

18:56.678 --> 19:00.015
but I have always
considered you my family.

19:00.724 --> 19:03.060
Even before
the recent threat of our parents

19:03.227 --> 19:05.604
fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits.

19:10.651 --> 19:14.488
I don't always show it,
but you are of great importance to me.

19:16.698 --> 19:17.699
Both of you.

19:18.075 --> 19:19.243
Aw!

19:19.409 --> 19:20.452
Thank you.

19:21.286 --> 19:22.329
Okay.

19:22.871 --> 19:25.249
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

19:26.792 --> 19:29.086
And weird other husband
who came with the apartment.

19:38.095 --> 19:40.097
Thank you for taking us to the airport.

19:40.264 --> 19:42.933
Hey, I'm just thrilled
we're all getting along for a minute.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.268
Yeah, me, too.

19:44.726 --> 19:46.770
Beverly, I'm sorry if I upset you.

19:47.104 --> 19:48.564
Water under the bridge, Alfred.

19:49.898 --> 19:51.900
Leonard, why don't you
get into the carpool lane?

19:52.067 --> 19:53.944
Well, that's a solid line,
he can't cross it.

19:54.111 --> 19:55.153
It's okay, I can make it over.

19:55.320 --> 19:58.866
No, no, let's plod along. It'll make your
father feel more comfortable.

20:00.492 --> 20:03.453
What makes me comfortable is knowing
I don't have to wake up tomorrow morning,

20:03.620 --> 20:05.455
and see your sour face.

20:07.165 --> 20:10.002
Do the world a favor,
and don't wake up tomorrow morning.

20:13.171 --> 20:14.631
It was almost a minute.

20:17.467 --> 20:19.970
There's a lot of traffic,
are we gonna be okay?

20:20.178 --> 20:21.847
You'll be at the airport
an hour before your flight.

20:22.014 --> 20:23.056
Good, thank you.

20:23.265 --> 20:26.476
Plenty of time for you
to meet another geriatric boy toy.

20:28.645 --> 20:31.440
Hey. I will not have you
be disrespectful to me.

20:31.607 --> 20:32.649
Yes, ma'am.

20:32.983 --> 20:34.860
Sheldon, your mother's
an attractive woman.

20:35.027 --> 20:37.988
You need to get used to the fact
that men are gonna be interested in her.

20:38.322 --> 20:41.241
And you need to drive the car
and mind your business.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.328
I will not have you
be disrespectful to me.

20:44.494 --> 20:46.955
- You're not my mother.
- Don't you be disrespectful to her!

20:47.122 --> 20:48.248
Yes, ma'am.

20:49.833 --> 20:52.878
You'll get there,
you just gotta put some zing on it.

20:56.715 --> 20:59.009
Penny, I don't know
what I was worried about.

20:59.176 --> 21:00.844
Your friends are just lovely.

21:01.094 --> 21:02.179
Thanks, Mom.

21:02.471 --> 21:05.682
Although, that Sheldon is a bit peculiar.

21:07.017 --> 21:08.852
Is he? I never noticed.

21:10.520 --> 21:14.066
Reminds me of that turkey we had,
who drowned looking up at the rain.

21:14.483 --> 21:17.110
That was great.

21:17.361 --> 21:19.279
Cops, cops. Be cool!

21:49.267 --> 21:50.268
English - SDH
