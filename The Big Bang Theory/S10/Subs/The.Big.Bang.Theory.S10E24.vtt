00:02.087 --> 00:03.672
<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

00:04.839 --> 00:08.093
I was offered a summer research fellowship
at Princeton.

00:10.220 --> 00:13.765
Princeton, a fine institution.

00:14.808 --> 00:17.268
The place where Albert Einstein taught

00:17.435 --> 00:21.189
and where Leonard got his PhD,
so it may have gone downhill.

00:23.817 --> 00:28.113
Just remember, I'm proud of you
and I support you in all that you do.

00:28.822 --> 00:30.240
Thank you, that means a lot.

00:30.407 --> 00:34.244
Oh, and one last thing, if you find
yourself working with a male scientist

00:34.411 --> 00:38.623
who's as smart as me, as tall as me,
and has hair like Thor,

00:38.790 --> 00:42.377
well, then, I want you to step away from
the situation and call me immediately.

00:46.005 --> 00:47.340
How are you settling in?

00:47.549 --> 00:50.468
<i>Pretty well.
Princeton has a beautiful campus.</i>

00:50.635 --> 00:52.721
You know, I've learned some fun facts
about New Jersey,

00:52.887 --> 00:53.888
to help you make small talk.

00:54.806 --> 00:58.017
Would you like to know the state bird
or the murder rate?

00:59.519 --> 01:00.937
They're both shocking.

01:02.939 --> 01:04.566
<i>Actually, I want to hear about you.</i>

01:04.733 --> 01:05.900
<i>How are things at home?</i>

01:06.067 --> 01:09.612
Well, I'm a lot less likely to see
an Eastern Goldfinch or be murdered,

01:09.779 --> 01:10.822
I'll tell you that.

01:12.532 --> 01:13.616
<i>I miss you.</i>

01:13.783 --> 01:14.993
I miss you, too.

01:15.160 --> 01:18.747
<i>It's so strange, earlier today,
I ended a sentence with a preposition,</i>

01:18.913 --> 01:21.541
<i>and you weren't there
to correct my grammar.</i>

01:21.708 --> 01:24.127
I am sorry you had to go through that.

01:26.004 --> 01:29.674
<i>In fact,
that's when I started to really miss you.</i>

01:31.676 --> 01:34.137
You know you just split an infinitive.

01:35.180 --> 01:38.975
<i>Did I? Are you going to teach me a lesson?</i>

01:41.853 --> 01:43.021
I am!

01:44.189 --> 01:48.526
It is naughty to put an adverb
between the word "to" and the verb stem.

01:50.028 --> 01:51.946
<i>What are you going to do about it?</i>

01:52.864 --> 01:54.866
I'm going to admonish you.

01:56.326 --> 01:57.827
<i>Vigorously?</i>

01:59.078 --> 02:01.414
That's the only kind of admonishing I do.

02:29.317 --> 02:31.027
How's Sheldon doing with Amy gone?

02:31.194 --> 02:34.197
Well, the last three nights,
I've had to take him to get a haircut,

02:34.364 --> 02:36.950
to the train store
and to a Walgreens in Arcadia,

02:37.116 --> 02:39.661
where they still have
the "good ibuprofen."

02:40.870 --> 02:43.289
Now ask me how I'm doing with Amy gone.

02:43.456 --> 02:44.874
- How are you doing with...
- Shut up.

02:46.918 --> 02:49.254
If you'd like, we can help you out.

02:49.420 --> 02:50.421
Oh, that would be great.

02:50.588 --> 02:51.923
I mean, not me, I've got a wife and child,

02:52.090 --> 02:55.385
but this one posts video of himself
flossing on Instagram.

02:57.178 --> 02:58.930
It was a tutorial.

03:00.515 --> 03:02.600
And yes,
I'm happy to keep Sheldon company.

03:02.767 --> 03:05.395
Great, tonight he wants to look at ladders
at Home Depot.

03:05.562 --> 03:06.563
Oh, why does he need a ladder?

03:06.729 --> 03:09.941
He doesn't, he just likes looking at them,
bring a book.

03:10.775 --> 03:15.446
Gentlemen, you may remember Dr. Nowitzki,
she's back at Caltech for her postdoc.

03:15.613 --> 03:18.283
- Hello.
- Hi. Oh, let me bring a chair for you.

03:18.449 --> 03:22.245
Oh, thanks. Dr. Nowitzki is going to
tell me about the work she did at CERN.

03:22.412 --> 03:25.874
And she brought me
this duty-free Toblerone.

03:26.457 --> 03:27.667
Oh, I love those!

03:28.501 --> 03:29.836
Let's sit somewhere else.

03:34.549 --> 03:36.134
What just happened?

03:37.760 --> 03:40.305
A stranger just lured Sheldon away
with a candy bar.

03:42.724 --> 03:45.059
Isn't she the grad student
that used to follow him around?

03:46.311 --> 03:49.647
Oh, yeah, back before he hit puberty
and grew man parts.

03:51.190 --> 03:53.109
So, what do you guys think that's about?

03:53.276 --> 03:54.819
Knowing Sheldon, nothing.

03:54.986 --> 03:57.989
So, tell me about
your scalar dark energy experiment.

03:58.156 --> 04:00.950
Not till you tell me about
your latest paper on quantum loop theory.

04:01.826 --> 04:04.245
Oh. You must be one of those
dessert-before-dinner people.

04:07.373 --> 04:09.542
He just made her laugh, something's wrong.

04:10.835 --> 04:13.171
Do you see the way she's looking at him?

04:13.504 --> 04:16.299
Yeah. Like Bernadette used to look at me.

04:16.466 --> 04:19.177
I keep telling you,
close the bathroom door.

04:21.554 --> 04:22.847
Oh, did you see that?

04:23.014 --> 04:25.350
She just touched his hand
and he didn't swat it away.

04:25.516 --> 04:27.018
What is happening?

04:27.352 --> 04:30.980
Okay, the simplest explanation
is usually the right one.

04:32.148 --> 04:34.359
- Which is?
- That ain't Sheldon.

04:38.696 --> 04:41.908
Not only did they eat together,
Leonard said he made her laugh!

04:42.075 --> 04:45.036
That's nothing,
Howie said she touched his hand.

04:45.203 --> 04:46.371
What? Did he Purell?

04:47.372 --> 04:48.373
No.

04:50.208 --> 04:52.210
I cannot believe Leonard
mentioned the Toblerone,

04:52.377 --> 04:54.045
but left that part out.

04:55.046 --> 04:56.130
Should we call Amy?

04:56.297 --> 04:58.758
I don't know,
we shouldn't worry her if it's nothing.

04:58.925 --> 05:01.052
I guess we could wait
till we have more information

05:01.219 --> 05:03.388
- about this girl.
- Yeah.

05:03.846 --> 05:08.935
Do you think living with Amy has somehow
stirred up Sheldon's sexual appetite?

05:10.520 --> 05:11.521
Ugh!

05:16.442 --> 05:17.944
How can you think that?

05:20.029 --> 05:22.657
Why would you even
put those words together?

05:22.824 --> 05:25.243
All right, then we agree,
he's not making any moves,

05:25.410 --> 05:27.120
it's this Dr. Ramona chick.

05:27.578 --> 05:30.331
Nowitzki. I googled her,
she's pretty cute.

05:30.665 --> 05:34.502
Really? All I got from Leonard was,
"The Toblerone bar had nuts."

05:37.714 --> 05:42.427
Oh! And get this, I saw an articulating
ladder with dual-leg leveling,

05:42.593 --> 05:46.014
which delivers stability
and adaptability to uneven terrain.

05:47.265 --> 05:49.183
<i>Sounds like a big night.</i>

05:49.767 --> 05:51.936
Raj made the funniest joke, he said,

05:52.103 --> 05:55.523
"Which is the best ladder to use
to hang myself?"

05:58.776 --> 06:01.154
<i>So you're keeping busy, you're not lonely?</i>

06:01.654 --> 06:05.074
Not at all. No, I've had outings with
Leonard and Raj in the evening,

06:05.241 --> 06:07.660
and, oh, I had lunch with Dr. Nowitzki.

06:07.827 --> 06:08.828
<i>Who's he?</i>

06:08.995 --> 06:10.538
Oh, no, Dr. Nowitzki is a woman.

06:11.289 --> 06:12.999
<i>Oh, really? When did you meet her?</i>

06:13.249 --> 06:15.668
Many years ago,
back when she was a grad student.

06:15.835 --> 06:19.839
She's always been a huge fan of my work,
and now she's doing research at Caltech.

06:21.507 --> 06:23.134
<i>"Huge fan" you say?</i>

06:24.552 --> 06:26.095
Yes. I think you'd like her.

06:26.262 --> 06:28.973
She's extremely intelligent,
just like you.

06:29.474 --> 06:33.311
Unlike you, she's tall, blonde
and used to be an Olympic swimmer.

06:36.898 --> 06:38.483
<i>That's terrific, I'll call you right back.</i>

06:41.819 --> 06:44.697
- Oh, hey, Amy.
<i>- I gave you one job!</i>

06:47.075 --> 06:49.786
<i>Keep an eye on him! How hard is that?</i>

06:50.870 --> 06:54.040
We thought you meant
not letting him run out into traffic.

06:56.167 --> 06:58.086
Which he only did once.

06:59.921 --> 07:01.214
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

07:01.380 --> 07:02.965
We didn't want you to worry.

07:03.132 --> 07:04.634
<i>Should I worry?</i>

07:04.801 --> 07:07.720
No, come on, it's Sheldon,
nothing is going to happen.

07:07.887 --> 07:09.806
<i>That's what you said to me
when I started dating him.</i>

07:09.972 --> 07:13.309
<i>And then five years later,
bingo-bango, something happened!</i>

07:14.227 --> 07:16.187
Yeah, but you're going to be back
in three months.

07:16.354 --> 07:17.688
<i>You don't get it.</i>

07:17.855 --> 07:20.358
<i>I've been smacking that ketchup bottle
for a long time.</i>

07:20.525 --> 07:24.028
<i>All she's got to do is tip it over
and point it at her fries!</i>

07:25.530 --> 07:26.697
What do you want us to do?

07:26.864 --> 07:28.282
<i>I don't know!</i>

07:28.574 --> 07:30.451
<i>Might be the New Jersey talking,</i>

07:30.618 --> 07:33.412
<i>but this Nowitzki broad
needs to disappear.</i>

07:34.914 --> 07:36.082
That's ridiculous.

07:36.249 --> 07:39.919
As far as we know, all that happened is
two scientists had lunch.

07:40.211 --> 07:43.714
<i>Yeah, but one of those scientists is
a tall, blonde Olympic swimmer!</i>

07:43.881 --> 07:46.384
Oh, come on, looks don't
matter to Sheldon.

07:47.718 --> 07:50.096
Because he only has eyes for you.

07:52.557 --> 07:54.767
<i>- Nice try.</i>
- Thanks, I was scrambling.

07:58.729 --> 07:59.897
It's unbelievable.

08:00.064 --> 08:03.818
Sheldon has lunch with another woman,
and somehow my wife yells at me.

08:04.735 --> 08:06.070
Penny laid into me, too.

08:06.237 --> 08:10.158
Apparently, I'm overly fixated
on premium Swiss chocolate bars.

08:11.951 --> 08:13.578
Can you even eat those things?

08:13.744 --> 08:17.123
Mmm, if I take a LACTAID a half-hour
before and some Pepto right after.

08:17.582 --> 08:19.041
Sounds like a lot of work.

08:19.709 --> 08:21.252
Ha, I'm worth it.

08:22.628 --> 08:25.631
Guys, focus.
Should we do something about Nowitzki?

08:25.798 --> 08:27.216
Like what?

08:28.009 --> 08:31.387
Uh, well, she's single,
so if somebody else asks her out,

08:31.554 --> 08:34.265
and she says yes,
then we know she's not into Sheldon.

08:34.432 --> 08:35.683
I'll do it.

08:41.647 --> 08:44.525
No offense, Stuart,
but the woman's a doctor.

08:45.401 --> 08:47.153
So? Doctors like me.

08:47.904 --> 08:51.949
Whenever I see mine, he calls in
a bunch of other doctors to have a look.

08:55.036 --> 08:57.121
She's not that kind of doctor.

08:57.872 --> 08:59.040
Oh. Well, her loss.

08:59.207 --> 09:02.210
I have been called
"a genuine medical oddity."

09:08.132 --> 09:10.343
Actually, I was going to suggest me.

09:10.509 --> 09:12.970
Great, anybody's better than...

09:15.306 --> 09:19.310
Excuse me, they took out my spleen
and gallbladder, not my feelings.

09:27.985 --> 09:30.947
- Dr. Nowitzki, good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

09:31.113 --> 09:32.323
May I join you?

09:32.490 --> 09:33.783
No.

09:37.370 --> 09:38.496
Good to see you.

09:41.666 --> 09:44.043
We should call Guinness,
that might be a record.

09:45.294 --> 09:49.298
She's clearly having a working lunch
and preferred to eat alone.

09:50.258 --> 09:52.260
Dr. Cooper, over here!

09:54.178 --> 09:56.514
I could have made her very happy.

09:58.015 --> 10:00.101
You kept walking, I think you did.

10:03.479 --> 10:05.064
You really think
there's reason to worry?

10:05.231 --> 10:07.400
Yeah, she's definitely
going after Sheldon.

10:07.566 --> 10:09.402
I made a play for her,
and she shot me down.

10:09.568 --> 10:11.529
All right, well,
that doesn't prove anything.

10:11.696 --> 10:15.199
Yeah, there's a million reasons
a woman would shoot Raj down.

10:17.326 --> 10:18.703
Like, really, a million?

10:18.869 --> 10:19.870
Fine, hundreds.

10:20.037 --> 10:21.372
Thank you.

10:22.373 --> 10:25.876
The point is, this could be nothing
and we are all overreacting.

10:26.961 --> 10:29.880
Hey, everybody, this is my friend,
Dr. Nowitzki.

10:30.047 --> 10:31.215
Hi.

10:31.382 --> 10:32.466
Hi.

10:34.427 --> 10:36.554
We just went swimming.

10:43.185 --> 10:44.729
You actually got in a pool?

10:45.396 --> 10:46.480
I was scared,

10:46.647 --> 10:50.109
but I told myself,
"It's just a big bathtub."

10:51.277 --> 10:53.154
Then I got scared again
'cause there are all these strangers

10:53.321 --> 10:54.322
in my bathtub.

10:55.531 --> 10:56.574
I was proud of him.

10:56.741 --> 10:59.410
A lot of people don't put
their face in the water on the first day.

10:59.577 --> 11:02.079
I was hiding from a bee,
but it still counts.

11:04.582 --> 11:06.542
Can I just squeeze in here?

11:10.546 --> 11:12.465
So, Sheldon, have you talked to Amy?

11:12.631 --> 11:13.758
Yes, we skyped this morning,

11:13.924 --> 11:15.676
and I'm sure I'll check in with her
before I go to sleep.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.595
Sheldon talks about her all the time.

11:17.762 --> 11:18.929
I can't wait to meet her.

11:19.096 --> 11:20.097
No... That is true,

11:20.264 --> 11:23.100
she keeps asking
how long Amy's going to be gone.

11:25.561 --> 11:29.190
Uh, so, Ramona, tell us about yourself,
do you have a boyfriend?

11:29.440 --> 11:33.361
Leonard! Your wife is sitting right here,
what are you doing?

11:36.113 --> 11:38.574
No, my work doesn't leave me a lot of time
for relationships.

11:38.741 --> 11:40.910
I think you made that very clear.

11:42.286 --> 11:44.705
She was part of the American team at CERN.

11:44.872 --> 11:47.458
I had a front-row seat
when they detected the Higgs boson.

11:48.250 --> 11:51.003
Do you know,
I've corresponded with Peter Higgs.

11:51.170 --> 11:52.463
Would you like to see some of his letters?

11:52.630 --> 11:54.465
- Absolutely.
- I'll get them.

11:54.799 --> 11:56.967
Well, hang on, I'll come with you.

11:57.385 --> 11:59.303
Oh, fun, like a playdate.

12:02.640 --> 12:03.641
Okay, correct me if I'm wrong,

12:03.808 --> 12:06.852
but isn't that exactly what we were
supposed to stop from happening?

12:08.270 --> 12:09.313
I threw my body at them!

12:09.480 --> 12:11.482
What else did you want me to do?

12:13.484 --> 12:14.819
You think you should call Amy?

12:14.985 --> 12:16.987
You got fingers and a mouth, you call her.

12:20.699 --> 12:22.118
Here you go.

12:22.326 --> 12:24.328
Are these all from Peter Higgs?

12:24.495 --> 12:26.414
Oh, no, no.
They're from many famous people.

12:26.831 --> 12:29.208
See? Oh, like this one.
This is from Patrick Stewart.

12:29.375 --> 12:33.963
It says if I come to his house again,
I get to meet his dogs.

12:38.092 --> 12:39.427
Oh, excuse me.

12:42.471 --> 12:44.306
<i>- Hello, Sheldon.</i>
- Oh, hello, Amy.

12:45.141 --> 12:46.809
<i>I was missing you again.</i>

12:46.976 --> 12:49.937
I miss you, too. Hey! This is good timing.

12:50.104 --> 12:52.648
You remember that Dr. Nowitzki
I told you about?

12:52.815 --> 12:54.150
She's right here!

12:55.609 --> 12:56.986
<i>She's what?</i>

12:59.238 --> 13:00.239
Hello.

13:01.323 --> 13:02.366
<i>Hi.</i>

13:02.783 --> 13:04.201
So nice to meet you.

13:04.952 --> 13:05.953
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

13:09.206 --> 13:11.709
<i>Hang on. Hello?</i>

13:13.210 --> 13:15.004
<i>Little late, Leonard!</i>

13:16.505 --> 13:17.548
<i>Sorry.</i>

13:17.715 --> 13:19.884
What is Leonard doing
calling you at this hour?

13:20.593 --> 13:22.052
<i>It's not important.</i>

13:22.470 --> 13:25.931
I must tell you,
that seems a little inappropriate.

13:26.098 --> 13:28.017
- Don't you agree?
- I do.

13:28.184 --> 13:29.560
See?

13:29.727 --> 13:31.562
We both think so.

13:34.231 --> 13:36.901
All right, this is making me crazy.
Somebody's got to go over there.

13:37.401 --> 13:39.570
You've got feet and legs, you do it.

13:42.406 --> 13:43.407
Will you go with me?

13:43.574 --> 13:46.410
To do what,
shake a can of nickels at them?

13:48.162 --> 13:49.830
We're being ridiculous.

13:49.997 --> 13:54.376
There's no way a woman that attractive
is trying to seduce Sheldon Cooper.

13:56.045 --> 13:58.756
You done
trying to make yourself feel better?

13:59.423 --> 14:01.926
No, I haven't played the race card yet.

14:04.595 --> 14:06.764
Hey. I hate to break up the party,

14:06.931 --> 14:10.226
but Amy says I'm tired
and have to go to bed.

14:12.394 --> 14:14.563
It was nice seeing everybody.
Thank you for dinner.

14:14.730 --> 14:15.814
- Sure.
- Pleasure.

14:15.981 --> 14:17.191
Whatever.

14:19.235 --> 14:21.111
- Walk me to my car?
- Of course.

14:21.445 --> 14:22.905
We'll all go!

14:39.463 --> 14:40.631
Excuse me.

14:52.309 --> 14:54.186
Pardon, I just need to... Yeah.

15:04.947 --> 15:07.449
That was fun, like <i>Mario Kart.</i>

15:12.162 --> 15:13.247
Bye.

15:14.331 --> 15:15.457
We need to talk.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.877
Is this about Leonard and Amy?
I don't like it either.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.342
Okay, I know you don't have
a lot of experience with women,

15:25.509 --> 15:28.470
but Ramona
seems to have a romantic interest in you.

15:29.221 --> 15:31.974
That doesn't make any sense,
she knows I have a girlfriend.

15:32.141 --> 15:34.184
Well, sometimes women don't care.

15:34.351 --> 15:36.186
Sometimes it makes them want a guy
even more.

15:37.855 --> 15:40.941
Look, that may be true,
but Dr. Nowitzki's just a friend.

15:41.108 --> 15:43.444
In fact, I wouldn't have even noticed
she's a woman

15:43.611 --> 15:46.739
if she hadn't worn that bathing suit
that highlighted her bosom.

15:50.326 --> 15:52.328
Okay, um,
let's try this,

15:52.494 --> 15:55.372
think of yourself as one of those
limited edition toys

15:55.539 --> 15:56.624
people like to collect.

15:57.833 --> 15:59.168
I already do.

16:01.462 --> 16:02.755
Well, then you get it.

16:03.380 --> 16:06.717
Oh! Because there's only one of me,
I'm more valuable.

16:06.884 --> 16:08.052
Right.

16:08.344 --> 16:09.386
Although,

16:09.553 --> 16:13.265
Amy's already taken me out of my package
and played with me.

16:17.227 --> 16:19.647
Let's forget the toy thing, okay?
Uh, maybe...

16:19.813 --> 16:24.193
Penny, look, I appreciate your concern,
but I don't think that's what's happening.

16:24.735 --> 16:27.071
All right, what do you think is happening?

16:27.655 --> 16:30.157
I think Dr. Nowitzki
is a friendly colleague.

16:30.908 --> 16:33.911
I think you and Leonard
need to see a marriage counselor.

16:35.496 --> 16:39.333
And I need to update my resume
to include swimming as a special skill.

16:47.716 --> 16:50.177
Don't look at me like that, I tried!

16:58.268 --> 16:59.478
Hey, did you eat yet?

17:00.104 --> 17:01.855
Ah, breakfast, yes, lunch, no.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.232
I did have a cough drop,

17:03.399 --> 17:06.610
but that really rides the line
between sucking and eating.

17:07.778 --> 17:09.405
Well, perfect. I made us sandwiches.

17:09.571 --> 17:11.115
How thoughtful.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.325
- Thank you.
- No big deal,

17:13.492 --> 17:15.160
I enjoy spending time with you.

17:15.327 --> 17:17.037
And I with you.

17:18.288 --> 17:19.331
Question.

17:20.124 --> 17:22.918
Are you seeking
a romantic relationship with me?

17:24.503 --> 17:25.629
What if I were?

17:26.672 --> 17:28.924
Well, that would raise
a number of problems.

17:29.091 --> 17:31.635
We're colleagues, I'm currently in a...

17:40.811 --> 17:42.146
Excuse me a moment.

18:42.122 --> 18:45.334
<i>Amy? Amy. Amy.</i>

19:02.851 --> 19:04.019
Will you marry me?

19:34.091 --> 19:35.092
