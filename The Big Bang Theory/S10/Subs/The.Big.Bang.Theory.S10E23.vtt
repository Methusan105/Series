00:02.045 --> 00:03.755
<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

00:04.798 --> 00:05.924
- What's this?
- Oh, nothing.

00:06.091 --> 00:07.133
Just some math we don't need.

00:07.592 --> 00:08.760
This is a different approach.

00:08.927 --> 00:11.513
Are you trying to get the guidance system
even smaller?

00:11.680 --> 00:15.183
It's just a theory.
It's not even worked out.

00:15.517 --> 00:16.976
Oh.

00:17.644 --> 00:19.020
I want this.

00:20.855 --> 00:23.274
But we've already met
the agreed-upon specs.

00:23.441 --> 00:27.112
Going smaller would require
weeks' worth of new computations.

00:27.612 --> 00:30.115
So get the kid with the two shirts
to do it.

00:31.825 --> 00:34.119
Sir, if I may,

00:34.285 --> 00:37.622
we've put a lot of thought and effort
into this current prototype.

00:37.789 --> 00:41.209
It's a really elegant solution
and most importantly, it works.

00:41.501 --> 00:42.877
You both make excellent points.

00:43.044 --> 00:45.672
Thank you for presenting it
so articulately.

00:46.423 --> 00:47.799
Make this.

00:50.510 --> 00:52.762
- Champagne, champagne.
- Thank you.

00:52.929 --> 00:55.682
And for the world's tallest second-grader,
apple juice.

00:57.851 --> 00:59.978
No bendy straw, some party.

01:01.312 --> 01:03.648
A toast, thank you all
for your support

01:03.815 --> 01:05.650
while we worked on our Air Force project

01:05.817 --> 01:08.319
and please know that we could
not have done it without you.

01:08.486 --> 01:10.655
- So, cheers!
- Cheers!

01:10.822 --> 01:13.992
It's nice of you to acknowledge us,
but this is your accomplishment.

01:14.159 --> 01:15.827
Yeah, you guys did this all on your own.

01:16.453 --> 01:17.495
Without me.

01:19.581 --> 01:20.665
To success without Raj.

01:23.084 --> 01:24.252
So, what happens next?

01:24.419 --> 01:27.505
Phase two, we test it, perfect it,
and hope to live long enough

01:27.672 --> 01:31.259
to see the movie based on our lives
starring more attractive versions of us.

01:31.718 --> 01:34.304
I'll definitely live long enough.
Vitamin C.

01:35.638 --> 01:37.390
First thing tomorrow morning,
we're back at it.

01:37.599 --> 01:38.808
Without me.

01:40.226 --> 01:43.646
I hope his character doesn't make it
into the movie, he's kind of a bummer.

01:47.317 --> 01:50.236
<i>Leonard Hofstadter. Access granted.</i>

01:50.403 --> 01:52.405
I don't care if this thing's
burning out my retinas,

01:52.572 --> 01:54.616
it makes me feel special.

01:55.325 --> 01:57.035
Before we field-test, I think...

02:00.580 --> 02:02.957
- What the hell?
- Where is everything?

02:03.166 --> 02:04.918
Who else has access to this room?

02:05.084 --> 02:07.378
It's a secure lab
in a classified facility,

02:07.587 --> 02:09.088
only the US Government and us.

02:09.255 --> 02:11.007
This is very disconcerting.

02:12.217 --> 02:14.260
But, the movie did just get good.

02:42.789 --> 02:45.083
Sir, I'm sorry, but I just don't get it,

02:45.250 --> 02:47.919
you came into our lab
in the middle of the night

02:48.086 --> 02:50.755
and took our prototype and all of our
research and didn't even tell us?

02:51.798 --> 02:53.883
<i>Sounds like you get it.</i>

02:55.426 --> 02:57.095
Why would you do that?

02:57.387 --> 02:59.639
<i>You guys completed phase one,
we'll take it from here.</i>

03:00.306 --> 03:01.641
Where did you move it?

03:01.850 --> 03:02.892
<i>I can't tell you that.</i>

03:03.268 --> 03:05.270
Are you implementing phase two?

03:05.436 --> 03:06.688
<i>I can't tell you that.</i>

03:07.105 --> 03:09.148
Wait, so you're just going to take
all the work we've done

03:09.315 --> 03:11.442
for the last year and toss us aside?

03:11.776 --> 03:14.195
<i>That one I can tell you. Yes.</i>

03:16.781 --> 03:18.783
This is all very upsetting.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.368
<i>I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

03:20.535 --> 03:21.953
<i>As you know, the primary focus</i>

03:22.161 --> 03:24.831
<i>of the United States military
is people's feelings.</i>

03:26.749 --> 03:29.627
If that's sarcasm,
please save it for our enemies.

03:32.881 --> 03:35.633
I may be moving out soon.
I think I found a place to live.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.051
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

03:37.802 --> 03:40.722
Really?
You kept sending me apartment listings.

03:43.266 --> 03:45.977
Um, well... Yeah, you got me.

03:48.146 --> 03:50.940
- Where are you moving?
- And when? But also, where?

03:52.483 --> 03:54.152
Bert has a room for rent.

03:54.319 --> 03:55.612
So, you're gonna be roommates with Bert?

03:56.154 --> 03:58.031
Uh, no, it's pretty private actually.

03:58.197 --> 03:59.449
It's over his garage.

03:59.616 --> 04:01.701
So, the only time I'll see him
is when he pulls his car in,

04:01.868 --> 04:04.954
does his laundry or practices drums
in my dining room.

04:06.497 --> 04:09.000
Well, good for you.
I actually have a little news myself.

04:09.167 --> 04:11.294
Okay, we're just gonna circle back
to when he's moving out...

04:11.461 --> 04:12.545
Okay, that's cool.

04:13.880 --> 04:16.758
I was, uh, asked to be
a visiting researcher at Princeton.

04:16.925 --> 04:18.509
- Hey, that's amazing.
- Congratulations.

04:18.676 --> 04:20.678
Thanks, but the thing is
I'll be gone for a few months

04:20.845 --> 04:22.680
and I don't know how
Sheldon's gonna feel about that.

04:22.847 --> 04:25.141
Oh, come on, he's a grown man,
he can take care of himself.

04:26.017 --> 04:27.977
You really believe that?

04:29.812 --> 04:31.147
Once again, you got me.

04:34.817 --> 04:37.946
How can you work on something for a year
and they just take it?

04:38.112 --> 04:40.406
I can't believe
the Air Force would treat us like that.

04:40.573 --> 04:43.534
You know, I've a good mind
to stop paying my taxes.

04:43.701 --> 04:46.454
It's too bad I enjoy doing them so much.

04:51.876 --> 04:56.047
The Air Force did it again!
They're erasing our lives.

04:57.882 --> 04:59.217
Third floor, wrong apartment.

05:02.095 --> 05:05.598
Although, if anyone's gonna clean out your
apartment and disappear, it'd be Penny.

05:07.225 --> 05:11.020
She might disappear, but she's definitely
not cleaning anything.

05:16.234 --> 05:17.568
It's okay, everything's here.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.321
Hey, what's goin' on?

05:20.571 --> 05:23.282
You won't believe it,
the military confiscated our project.

05:23.449 --> 05:25.410
- What?
- You're kidding, why would they do that?

05:25.576 --> 05:26.953
They wouldn't say.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.788
I feel so betrayed.

05:28.955 --> 05:30.373
All my life I thought Uncle Sam

05:30.540 --> 05:32.667
was a friendly uncle
who brought you presents.

05:32.834 --> 05:35.503
It turns out, he's the other kind.

05:37.005 --> 05:38.089
Sheldon, I'm so sorry.

05:38.256 --> 05:40.091
Thank you.
Can we just talk about something else?

05:40.258 --> 05:41.676
Yeah, what's going on with you guys?

05:41.843 --> 05:43.469
Give us some good news.

05:43.636 --> 05:45.138
Amy's got some news.

05:49.809 --> 05:51.019
Yeah, um...

05:52.562 --> 05:54.272
Raj is moving out.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.817
Oh, no. When?

06:02.947 --> 06:04.240
You doing okay?

06:04.407 --> 06:05.658
Not really.

06:06.451 --> 06:10.121
You want me to put on some Neil Diamond?
That always makes you feel better.

06:10.663 --> 06:14.584
No, then you'll get all sexed up,
and I'm not in the mood.

06:16.210 --> 06:18.296
I mean, an entire year wasted.

06:19.297 --> 06:21.841
You might be forgetting another
accomplishment of the past year.

06:22.842 --> 06:25.261
Oh. Yeah, yeah,
we brought life into the world.

06:27.013 --> 06:29.807
Really? That's the importance
you put on us having a baby?

06:29.974 --> 06:32.727
I'm happy about it,
but it's not like I did much.

06:32.894 --> 06:36.147
I mean, after the first three minutes,
it was pretty much all you.

06:40.109 --> 06:41.819
So, did you tell him about Princeton yet?

06:42.028 --> 06:43.905
No, I'm waiting until he's in a good mood.

06:44.405 --> 06:46.991
Oh. Sweetie, you might not live that long.

06:48.785 --> 06:50.161
I don't know, maybe I shouldn't go.

06:50.328 --> 06:52.080
Oh, stop it. He'll be fine.

06:52.246 --> 06:55.708
I guess. And he'll have you and Leonard
right across the hall the whole time.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.461
Oh, damn. Wait, maybe you shouldn't go.

06:58.628 --> 07:01.756
Gotta go. Morning.

07:03.174 --> 07:06.636
I apologize for exceeding
my allotted bathroom time.

07:07.470 --> 07:08.513
You feeling okay?

07:08.679 --> 07:13.518
Not really. Apparently grief
can make one less regular.

07:15.269 --> 07:16.646
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

07:16.813 --> 07:19.440
I sat and I sat, but to no avail.

07:21.526 --> 07:24.153
Well, the more details, the more sorry.

07:25.530 --> 07:27.740
Well, maybe this'll cheer you up.

07:27.907 --> 07:31.035
I made your favorite oatmeal, plain.

07:33.579 --> 07:34.789
What's the occasion?

07:35.456 --> 07:38.334
No occasion, I just wanted to do
something nice for you.

07:38.793 --> 07:40.628
You're so kind.

07:40.795 --> 07:42.880
Now, I don't know
how I ever got by without you.

07:45.925 --> 07:48.719
That's sweet,
but you did just fine on your own.

07:49.887 --> 07:51.889
I thought that too,
but I've come to realize

07:52.056 --> 07:53.975
I am completely dependent on you.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.229
Sheldon, you're being silly.

07:58.396 --> 08:01.190
No, to wake up every morning

08:01.399 --> 08:03.693
and know you're there
is a great comfort to me.

08:05.736 --> 08:06.737
Mmm...

08:06.904 --> 08:08.447
Tasteless.

08:12.743 --> 08:14.245
How do you do it?

08:16.080 --> 08:19.250
You know, what you need to do is
put this Air Force project behind you

08:19.417 --> 08:20.751
and just dive into something new.

08:21.919 --> 08:24.964
Well, there is our
quantum cognition experiment.

08:25.131 --> 08:26.966
You and I could spend more time on that.

08:27.633 --> 08:31.137
Oh, I don't know, I mean,
let's say we succeed

08:31.304 --> 08:33.431
in proving that our consciousness
creates reality.

08:33.598 --> 08:35.099
I mean, what will we
have really accomplished?

08:35.266 --> 08:37.435
You know, a loaf of bread's
still three bucks.

08:39.270 --> 08:42.899
I'm confused. You're always saying that
you want to spend more time with me.

08:43.357 --> 08:44.942
That is true, I have said that.

08:45.109 --> 08:47.445
Well, a lot, it's very annoying.

08:49.488 --> 08:50.948
Has something changed?

08:51.115 --> 08:53.242
Is there something
that you're not telling me?

08:56.579 --> 08:59.916
I was offered a summer research fellowship
at Princeton.

09:02.668 --> 09:06.339
Princeton, a fine institution.

09:07.590 --> 09:10.009
The place where Albert Einstein taught

09:10.176 --> 09:14.138
and where Leonard got his PhD,
so it may have gone downhill.

09:17.141 --> 09:18.476
That's the one.

09:19.143 --> 09:22.480
Well, that's wonderful, congratulations.

09:22.647 --> 09:25.942
Well, I haven't accepted it yet,
I wanted to talk to you first.

09:26.108 --> 09:29.570
Well, what is there to talk about?
You have to take it, it's important.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.948
- So are you.
- Thank you, but I'll be fine.

09:32.156 --> 09:33.366
Are you sure?

09:33.824 --> 09:37.828
Yes. I may have lost my guidance system
and my girlfriend,

09:37.995 --> 09:41.707
but I still have a colon full of
yesterday's meals to keep me company.

09:44.835 --> 09:46.254
Although thanks to your
high-fiber breakfast,

09:46.420 --> 09:47.672
I'm sure that'll be leaving me too.

09:55.012 --> 09:58.849
Really? He doesn't put raisins
or banana slices or anything in it?

10:00.726 --> 10:03.813
I don't think plain oatmeal
was the point of that story.

10:03.980 --> 10:06.983
- I mean, I like a little brown sugar...
- Guys.

10:07.149 --> 10:10.403
Sorry. You're still gonna go, right?

10:10.569 --> 10:12.947
I don't know,
Sheldon's so vulnerable right now.

10:13.114 --> 10:14.991
Oh, come on.
Look, if the roles were reversed,

10:15.157 --> 10:16.867
he'd be on the first train to New Jersey

10:17.034 --> 10:19.620
or the second train
if there were teenagers on the first one.

10:21.330 --> 10:23.124
A little distance might be nice.

10:23.291 --> 10:25.376
The last time a big project
ended for Howie,

10:25.543 --> 10:27.003
he wouldn't stop following me around.

10:27.169 --> 10:28.879
He even went with me to get a mammogram.

10:29.255 --> 10:30.256
Well, what's wrong with that?

10:30.423 --> 10:34.510
No, he wanted to get one with me,
like some kind of weird couple's massage.

10:36.387 --> 10:38.055
And yet you bore his child, neato.

10:40.558 --> 10:43.102
Well, you're excited
about this opportunity, right?

10:43.269 --> 10:45.271
Of course,
I get to be a part of the first team

10:45.438 --> 10:47.481
to use radon markers
to map the structures that...

10:47.648 --> 10:49.734
Okay. A simple "yes" will do.

10:50.901 --> 10:53.863
- You have to go.
- I know, but what if Sheldon...

10:54.030 --> 10:57.241
Okay. Listen to me, your relationship can
handle being long-distance for a while.

10:57.408 --> 10:58.909
It's not like you two are very physical.

10:59.327 --> 11:01.245
You don't know
what goes on behind closed doors.

11:01.412 --> 11:02.413
A lot of lectures?

11:02.663 --> 11:03.748
All right, so you know.

11:05.666 --> 11:08.377
I'm telling you, if you don't go,
you'll end up regretting it.

11:08.627 --> 11:10.129
Hey! Wait up.

11:10.421 --> 11:11.589
Oh, great.

11:13.090 --> 11:14.967
You left something at home.

11:15.134 --> 11:17.261
- A big hug!
- Oh!

11:19.096 --> 11:20.973
I found it right next to these kisses.

11:23.059 --> 11:24.935
It's too late for me, save yourself.

11:28.773 --> 11:30.691
So, are you excited
to have your own place again?

11:30.858 --> 11:34.236
- I am, but I'll miss you guys.
- I know, we'll miss you too.

11:35.321 --> 11:38.240
You could try saying that without smiling.

11:38.574 --> 11:41.202
I'm trying, but this is the best I can do.

11:51.295 --> 11:52.463
What are you doing?

11:53.339 --> 11:54.715
What does it look like?

11:54.882 --> 11:56.967
I'm playing sad harmonica

11:57.593 --> 12:00.096
in an apartment as empty as my heart.

12:01.722 --> 12:02.807
Why?

12:03.474 --> 12:06.644
I got the blues. My baby done left me.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.481
Come on, Sheldon.

12:10.648 --> 12:12.566
Amy's only gone for a few months.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.985
And now that I'm moving out,
your old room is empty,

12:15.152 --> 12:17.071
so you can stay there whenever you want.

12:17.238 --> 12:18.989
Uh, could I talk to you
in the hall for a sec?

12:19.156 --> 12:20.574
Yeah, sure.

12:26.997 --> 12:28.833
Sheldon, you're being silly.

12:28.999 --> 12:31.710
Am I?
Yesterday I had an Air Force project,

12:31.877 --> 12:36.048
a girlfriend who lived with me and
my good friend Raj right across the hall.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.509
You really care about that last one?

12:39.218 --> 12:41.429
No, but that list
was sounding a little thin.

12:42.471 --> 12:45.808
Well, instead of dwelling on the negative,
think about this.

12:45.975 --> 12:48.394
Your girlfriend was given
an amazing opportunity,

12:48.561 --> 12:50.896
which gives you an opportunity to show her

12:51.063 --> 12:53.357
that you're a loving
and supportive boyfriend.

12:55.401 --> 12:56.902
So, trick her.

13:00.114 --> 13:03.451
All right, let me start again.
Uh, you and Amy...

13:03.617 --> 13:07.037
<i>Can I get my stuff?
Sounds like it's gonna be a while.</i>

13:14.879 --> 13:16.046
I missed you.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.967
- Come here, let's talk.
- Ooh.

13:20.551 --> 13:23.220
Sounds serious. Have I been a bad boy?

13:23.387 --> 13:25.681
- Am I gonna get a spanking...
- Just listen!

13:27.266 --> 13:29.727
I don't know if you realize this,

13:29.894 --> 13:34.356
but whenever you're between projects
you tend to get a little insecure.

13:34.690 --> 13:35.816
- Oh.
- A little clingy.

13:36.233 --> 13:38.402
I know,
and I'm sorry.

13:38.903 --> 13:41.071
Oh, oh! Okay, stop. Stop!

13:43.616 --> 13:47.328
I love when you're affectionate,
but this is not coming from a good place.

13:47.912 --> 13:51.540
Well, excuse me, but what did you do
when you worked on that allergy drug

13:51.707 --> 13:54.293
for two years and the FDA
shut down your project?

13:55.628 --> 13:58.255
I signed us up for ballroom dance class.

14:00.049 --> 14:04.345
Okay. And what did you do when they
took you off the anti-fungal team?

14:06.222 --> 14:07.556
I made us have a baby.

14:11.143 --> 14:12.394
So?

14:12.770 --> 14:14.605
Bring it in.

14:16.023 --> 14:18.359
And now the movie
just got rated R.

14:23.781 --> 14:26.075
Hey. You going somewhere?

14:26.784 --> 14:30.955
No, but you are,
so I got you this as a present.

14:32.289 --> 14:33.958
Sheldon, that isn't necessary.

14:34.166 --> 14:36.252
No, it is. Leonard pointed out to me

14:36.418 --> 14:39.588
that I'm not always
a loving and supportive boyfriend,

14:39.755 --> 14:42.591
so here's some quality luggage.

14:44.677 --> 14:45.761
Thank you.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.514
The salesman said
it could survive a plane crash, so...

14:52.309 --> 14:53.811
Perhaps you should fly inside it.

14:58.607 --> 15:01.068
Does this mean you're okay with me going?

15:01.235 --> 15:02.861
Well, I'm not looking forward to it,

15:03.028 --> 15:07.032
but it is a wonderful opportunity
and you need to take it.

15:07.199 --> 15:09.493
Besides, Princeton is in New Jersey,

15:09.743 --> 15:12.454
so it's not like
you're gonna want to stay.

15:18.419 --> 15:19.420
Uh...

15:20.087 --> 15:22.047
I know it's not your birthday,
but if you're interested...

15:22.214 --> 15:23.591
- I am.
- Okay.

15:26.010 --> 15:27.720
Oh, and just to be clear,

15:28.512 --> 15:31.348
I'm not being intimate with you
in order to keep you from going.

15:32.266 --> 15:33.350
I wasn't thinking that.

15:33.517 --> 15:35.936
Well, no, I'm just warning you, you know,

15:36.103 --> 15:40.357
if you find yourself 3,000 miles away
and craving a hit of this...

15:43.110 --> 15:45.279
I can't Skype it to you.

15:47.323 --> 15:49.199
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

15:50.284 --> 15:54.079
All right then, let's go to the bedroom,

15:54.246 --> 15:56.749
remove our clothes, fold them neatly...

15:58.876 --> 16:02.546
And engage in frenzied lovemaking.

16:05.132 --> 16:07.176
What if we don't fold our clothes at all?

16:07.343 --> 16:11.055
Or... What if we fold them?

16:15.100 --> 16:16.977
- Well, here's your key back.
- Thank you.

16:17.144 --> 16:19.229
Uh, soon as I have the place set up,
I'm gonna have you guys over.

16:19.396 --> 16:20.898
Oh, we would love that.

16:21.065 --> 16:23.442
I really can't thank you enough
for taking me in.

16:23.609 --> 16:25.903
I was at a pretty low place in my life...

16:26.070 --> 16:27.905
<i>Oh, Amy, you naughty vixen.</i>

16:34.411 --> 16:37.247
Anyway, uh, as I was saying,

16:37.414 --> 16:39.625
I was at a pretty low place in my life

16:39.792 --> 16:41.543
and if it wasn't for friends like you...

16:41.710 --> 16:44.254
<i>My goodness, that form of stimulation
is highly efficient.</i>

16:49.802 --> 16:51.095
I can't compete with that, bye.

16:54.223 --> 16:55.432
Should we give them their privacy?

16:55.683 --> 16:58.185
I want to, but I don't think I can.

16:59.937 --> 17:01.647
Okay, I'm good now.

17:10.239 --> 17:12.700
Okay, the car is waiting.
Do you wanna walk me downstairs?

17:12.908 --> 17:15.536
Of course. Here, let me.

17:15.703 --> 17:17.996
I've been doing a little research
on New Jersey,

17:18.163 --> 17:22.626
and I was delighted to learn that
their chief agricultural product is sod.

17:24.878 --> 17:26.755
- Is it?
- Yes. Yeah.

17:26.922 --> 17:29.383
Perhaps I've been harder on them
than they deserve.

17:32.261 --> 17:36.306
Do you think it's possible you might enjoy
being on your own for a little while?

17:37.182 --> 17:40.227
Well, it's hard to say.
I've never really lived by myself.

17:40.394 --> 17:42.730
What if I become strange and eccentric?

17:48.527 --> 17:49.820
I'll love you no matter what.

17:52.322 --> 17:55.159
Howard Hughes saved his urine
in milk bottles.

17:57.369 --> 17:59.538
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.584
You'll text me
when you arrive at the airport?

18:03.751 --> 18:05.836
- I will. Uh-huh.
- When you're at the gate?

18:06.003 --> 18:08.630
And if you see any actors
from <i>Game of Thrones</i> in first class?

18:10.716 --> 18:12.342
I don't know what they look like,
but sure.

18:12.885 --> 18:14.928
- Don't forget to Skype me when you arrive.
- I won't.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.388
- And every morning.
- Got it.

18:16.597 --> 18:18.682
Now, of course my 9:00 a.m.
is your noon,

18:18.849 --> 18:21.143
so let's avoid the whole
"good morning, good afternoon" minefield,

18:21.310 --> 18:22.978
and let's just say, "Hello."

18:23.979 --> 18:25.189
Good thinking.

18:25.355 --> 18:29.276
And just remember, I'm proud of you
and I support you in all that you do.

18:30.402 --> 18:31.737
Thank you, that means a lot.

18:31.945 --> 18:35.908
Oh, and one last thing, if you find
yourself working with a male scientist

18:36.074 --> 18:40.204
who's as smart as me, as tall as me,
and has hair like Thor,

18:40.370 --> 18:44.750
well, then, I want you to step away from
the situation and call me immediately.

19:13.904 --> 19:14.905
