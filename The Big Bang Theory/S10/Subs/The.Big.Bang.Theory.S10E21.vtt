WEBVTT

00:03.755 --> 00:07.842
All right, we're about to go live,
everyone on their A-game, good energy.

00:09.260 --> 00:10.929
Hello.

00:12.263 --> 00:13.890
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

00:14.099 --> 00:15.767
And I'm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.

00:15.975 --> 00:18.019
And welcome to a special retrospective,

00:18.269 --> 00:20.772
where we will take a look back
at the history of <i>Fun with Flags</i>

00:21.106 --> 00:22.649
on an episode we're calling...

00:24.234 --> 00:27.737
<i>"Fun with Flags, Behind the Flags,
A Retrospective."</i>

00:31.366 --> 00:32.784
<i>Wondering how it all began?</i>

00:32.951 --> 00:34.369
<i>You'll need a good attention span</i>

00:34.703 --> 00:37.622
<i>For information and entertainment</i>

00:38.039 --> 00:40.917
<i>That's equally effective</i>

00:41.459 --> 00:47.924
<i>It's fun with flags, behind the flags
A retrospective</i>

00:48.258 --> 00:49.300
<i>Flags</i>

00:53.555 --> 00:55.890
And mind you, when we say,
"Behind the flags,"

00:56.099 --> 00:59.894
we don't literally mean these flags,
that's just where we have dinner.

01:01.646 --> 01:05.567
Now, I'm sure many of you are wondering
how <i>Fun with Flags</i> began.

01:06.109 --> 01:09.362
So let's hear from some people
who were there at the very start.

01:09.654 --> 01:11.322
Howard, flashback sounds.

01:16.244 --> 01:19.497
- I could've played that on my harp.
- Just roll the clip.

01:19.706 --> 01:23.418
<i>So tell us in your own words
about that magical moment</i>

01:23.585 --> 01:25.044
<i>when</i> Fun with Flags <i>was born.</i>

01:25.336 --> 01:26.880
I honestly don't remember.

01:29.215 --> 01:30.341
<i>Well, sure you do.</i>

01:30.550 --> 01:31.968
<i>I was telling you both the story</i>

01:32.135 --> 01:35.180
<i>about how Haiti and Liechtenstein
discovered they had the same flag.</i>

01:35.346 --> 01:37.974
<i>It was at the Summer Olympics of 1936,</i>

01:38.141 --> 01:39.434
<i>and two plucky nations...</i>

01:39.601 --> 01:40.602
Wait, I remember.

01:40.769 --> 01:42.228
<i>Yeah, and do you remember what you said?</i>

01:42.687 --> 01:45.023
Yes. "Please find someone who cares."

01:47.275 --> 01:48.902
And that's exactly what I did.

01:51.613 --> 01:53.281
I found a lot of someones.

01:54.324 --> 01:55.909
Almost 200.

01:56.701 --> 01:58.161
Many of them on purpose.

02:00.038 --> 02:02.707
And now we're going to
turn it over to you, the viewers,

02:02.957 --> 02:06.419
to call in and share your favorite
<i>Fun with Flags</i> moments.

02:06.920 --> 02:10.965
And don't get discouraged if the
phone lines are jammed, just keep trying.

02:32.946 --> 02:35.657
Oh, thank God! Welcome to <i>Fun with Flags.</i>

02:36.407 --> 02:38.493
Hey, Sheldon. Hey, Amy. It's Bert.

02:39.035 --> 02:43.122
What... Hello, Bert, and what is your
flag-related comment or query?

02:43.289 --> 02:44.916
I have a girlfriend.

02:47.752 --> 02:50.088
And what does that have to do with flags?

02:50.463 --> 02:53.800
Nothing, I just wanted everyone to know
I have a girlfriend.

02:54.133 --> 02:56.052
All right, Bert, you're tying up the line.

02:56.219 --> 03:00.932
My apologies to all of you trying to
call in with legitimate flag comments.

03:01.099 --> 03:03.768
All right, we have our next caller.

03:04.102 --> 03:05.520
<i>Her name's Rebecca.</i>

03:34.966 --> 03:37.802
Should we get lunch
or you wanna eat at the zoo?

03:39.637 --> 03:44.142
"Oh, Howie, I don't need food
as long as I can look at my phone."

03:45.894 --> 03:47.312
I don't like when you imitate me.

03:47.645 --> 03:48.688
You wanna hear my Stuart?

03:48.855 --> 03:52.942
"It's been a while
since I've gone on a date.

03:53.109 --> 03:55.945
"You mind if we
watch the monkeys doing it?"

04:01.451 --> 04:03.202
I said that to you in confidence.

04:05.496 --> 04:07.957
If this is supposed to be
our family fun day,

04:08.124 --> 04:09.709
what's so important on your phone?

04:09.918 --> 04:11.252
I'm on the day care's website.

04:11.628 --> 04:13.004
What... Stop looking at that.

04:13.171 --> 04:15.173
The day care's great. It's on campus.

04:15.506 --> 04:18.176
My office is two minutes away,
there's nothing to worry about.

04:18.635 --> 04:21.054
What if she likes the people
who work there more than us?

04:21.346 --> 04:23.723
She already likes soap bubbles
more than us.

04:25.725 --> 04:27.769
When I go back to work we're gonna
leave her with these people.

04:27.936 --> 04:29.354
We don't know anything about them.

04:30.605 --> 04:33.608
I mean, they're highly-trained educators
with background checks.

04:33.775 --> 04:36.527
They're even required to be current
on all vaccinations.

04:38.029 --> 04:39.948
You leave her with me,
and I'm not any of those things.

04:44.035 --> 04:45.161
Where's Howard?

04:45.453 --> 04:46.871
He took the day off.

04:47.121 --> 04:49.624
Oh, let's take advantage of his absence

04:49.791 --> 04:51.918
and tell the kinds of jokes
only physicists get.

04:52.210 --> 04:53.711
I'll go first.

04:54.045 --> 04:57.799
Oh, hey, here. Heisenberg is pulled over
by a police officer.

04:57.966 --> 05:01.761
And the policeman says, "Did you know
you were going 85 miles per hour?"

05:01.928 --> 05:05.223
And Heisenberg says,
"Darn it, now I don't know where I am."

05:08.184 --> 05:09.352
So Howard back Monday?

05:09.519 --> 05:10.520
Yeah.

05:12.146 --> 05:13.523
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hello.

05:13.690 --> 05:14.857
- Hey.
- You wanna join us?

05:15.108 --> 05:17.485
But he's a geologist,
and I have more physics jokes.

05:17.777 --> 05:18.987
Quick, sit.

05:22.365 --> 05:24.075
So Sheldon says you have a new girlfriend.

05:24.325 --> 05:26.869
Yeah, which he rudely announced
on my flag show.

05:27.036 --> 05:28.079
People were so upset about it,

05:28.246 --> 05:30.748
no one else called in
the rest of the night.

05:31.541 --> 05:33.543
Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

05:33.710 --> 05:35.336
I guess I just love love.

05:36.546 --> 05:37.714
Well, I'm very happy for you.

05:38.256 --> 05:40.717
We're all having dinner tonight,
why don't the two of you join us?

05:40.883 --> 05:44.012
Yeah, hold on,
we don't know anything about this woman.

05:44.429 --> 05:45.555
What do you wanna know?

05:45.847 --> 05:47.223
Well, is she a geologist?

05:47.390 --> 05:49.058
- No.
- Oh, great, see you at 7:00.

05:57.316 --> 05:59.944
How about after this
we go see the exotic bird show?

06:00.194 --> 06:04.115
Not a good idea,
my hair is a coveted nesting material.

06:07.744 --> 06:08.953
Learning anything?

06:09.287 --> 06:13.458
Well, sloth babies cling to their
mothers' bodies for almost a year.

06:13.624 --> 06:15.418
I'm going back to work
after only four months.

06:15.585 --> 06:17.253
So I've learned I hate myself,
I hate sloths,

06:17.420 --> 06:19.297
and I hate you for bringing me here.

06:21.340 --> 06:24.510
Me, I get, but that sloth is pretty cute.

06:26.471 --> 06:28.014
It's not just the sloth.

06:28.306 --> 06:30.892
Polar bears nurse their cubs
for almost eight months.

06:31.059 --> 06:34.187
The orangutan mother builds her baby
a new home every night,

06:34.437 --> 06:37.065
and what do I do?
I choose my career over my child!

06:41.152 --> 06:43.279
Told you we should've gone to LEGOLAND?

06:46.491 --> 06:48.659
Can't believe Bert has a girlfriend
and I don't.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.871
I thought you were taking a break
from women to focus on your career.

06:52.038 --> 06:53.206
Oh, grow up!

06:57.668 --> 06:59.128
Don't you have any friends he can date?

06:59.295 --> 07:01.047
I already set up Howard and Bernadette.

07:01.214 --> 07:04.092
It's your turn to
ruin some poor girl's life.

07:05.176 --> 07:07.053
- Hey, guys, come in.
- Thanks.

07:07.637 --> 07:09.847
Everyone, this is Rebecca.

07:10.014 --> 07:11.057
- Hi.
- Hi. Hello.

07:11.849 --> 07:14.352
She's younger
and far more attractive than he is.

07:16.771 --> 07:18.731
They're copying you two.

07:23.903 --> 07:25.154
What are you making?

07:25.446 --> 07:29.200
Chicken. Birds mess with my hair,
I come back hard.

07:34.163 --> 07:35.456
Finally get Halley down?

07:35.623 --> 07:36.666
Yeah, eventually.

07:36.916 --> 07:38.793
She's still not happy about
taking a bottle though.

07:39.085 --> 07:40.878
Look, if you're not ready
to go back to work,

07:41.045 --> 07:42.255
we'll figure something out.

07:42.421 --> 07:43.631
No, I'll be fine.

07:44.423 --> 07:45.716
It might be good for her.

07:45.967 --> 07:48.344
Howard's mother
was around him all the time,

07:48.553 --> 07:50.596
and he's a world-class mama's boy.

07:52.223 --> 07:54.308
I mean, why would you say that?

07:54.684 --> 07:57.228
Go ahead, have a tantrum,
that'll prove me wrong.

08:00.898 --> 08:03.985
It would be nice to raise Halley to be
a little more independent than you were.

08:04.527 --> 08:05.570
I guess.

08:05.862 --> 08:10.158
It wasn't until college that I learned
you can put a thermometer in your mouth.

08:14.370 --> 08:17.623
On that charming note, dinner is served.

08:21.586 --> 08:23.504
So, is this your first time
dating a scientist?

08:23.671 --> 08:25.756
'Cause I'm thinking of
starting a support group.

08:27.425 --> 08:30.595
Actually, I'm not new to this.
I was engaged to a Scientologist.

08:36.434 --> 08:41.272
Bert, Rebecca, I'd like to apologize
for my insensitive comment earlier.

08:41.439 --> 08:43.149
Don't worry about it, it's fine.

08:43.482 --> 08:46.027
See, it was fine, I didn't need a timeout.

08:48.487 --> 08:50.948
It wasn't a timeout. Let's get some food.

08:51.115 --> 08:53.284
But you made me sit on the stairs
and think about what I did...

08:53.451 --> 08:54.577
Get your food.

08:56.787 --> 08:59.123
- So how did you two meet?
- Yeah.

08:59.457 --> 09:01.417
Oh, it's such a cute story.

09:01.667 --> 09:03.461
We met on a dating website.

09:09.008 --> 09:10.051
Is that it?

09:10.218 --> 09:12.470
Oh, sorry. "The end."

09:15.598 --> 09:19.393
That's nice. I haven't had much success
meeting people online.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.979
I didn't either,
until I revamped my profile.

09:22.146 --> 09:24.148
What did you do, delete your photo?

09:29.487 --> 09:30.821
- Go.
- Fine.

09:34.242 --> 09:35.910
And don't you slam that door.

09:36.327 --> 09:37.536
Oh, man.

09:39.997 --> 09:41.332
Did I say something wrong?

09:41.499 --> 09:42.959
No, it's always him.

09:45.378 --> 09:48.047
So, Bert, you were telling us
how you updated your profile.

09:48.422 --> 09:50.549
Right, I wasn't getting any responses.

09:50.716 --> 09:54.887
And then I added,
"Recent $625,000 MacArthur Grant winner,"

09:55.054 --> 09:56.055
and five minutes later,

09:56.389 --> 09:58.391
I met my soulmate.

10:03.020 --> 10:05.439
I was wrong, you can come back in.

10:11.362 --> 10:14.115
So, Rebecca,
how did you become a personal trainer?

10:14.699 --> 10:18.077
I came to Los Angeles to be an actress
and things didn't really work out.

10:18.786 --> 10:21.372
I'd say she's copying you again, but...

10:23.040 --> 10:25.293
I'm getting tired of sitting in the hall.

10:26.377 --> 10:28.212
I'd love a personal trainer.

10:28.462 --> 10:31.882
I haven't seen my abs since they opened
a Shake Shack on my drive home.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.094
I could give you some free sessions.

10:35.261 --> 10:36.887
Oh, is that offer for everybody?

10:37.054 --> 10:39.181
Nice try, I'm not going.

10:42.852 --> 10:45.229
- Where's your bathroom?
- Just down there.

10:47.064 --> 10:49.483
She's so perfect,
sometimes I think she isn't real.

10:49.734 --> 10:53.237
And then she goes to the bathroom
and I know she is.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.407
Aw. That's so weird.

10:58.367 --> 11:01.162
I'm sorry, Bert, but aren't you worried
she's only with you for your money?

11:01.329 --> 11:02.371
She better be.

11:02.538 --> 11:05.249
On our first date,
I bought her an 80-inch flat screen.

11:07.043 --> 11:10.713
Your first date? What...
Did you even measure her walls?

11:16.927 --> 11:20.765
Yeah, on our first date,
Leonard used a coupon to buy me a pretzel.

11:21.724 --> 11:24.101
And we lived happily ever after.

11:25.811 --> 11:27.104
The end.

11:30.608 --> 11:33.944
- Well, I guess I'm ready to go.
- Have a great first day back.

11:34.111 --> 11:35.488
You have everything she needs
for day care?

11:35.738 --> 11:37.114
Yep, all in the bag.

11:37.281 --> 11:38.366
Okay.

11:38.991 --> 11:42.453
Okay, sweetie, Mommy's going to go
to work now, so you have fun today.

11:42.620 --> 11:44.163
I told her if day care's
anything like prison,

11:44.330 --> 11:46.165
find the biggest baby and knock 'em out.

11:49.293 --> 11:51.962
Bye, cutie. I'm gonna miss you.

11:52.963 --> 11:56.384
But I'll be waiting
right here tonight when you get home.

11:59.136 --> 12:00.805
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.

12:01.806 --> 12:03.557
Great, now everybody's crying.

12:04.975 --> 12:06.477
At least Halley's not.

12:06.644 --> 12:07.812
That's good.

12:08.437 --> 12:11.023
She's not gonna see us all day
and she doesn't even care!

12:14.402 --> 12:15.986
Who's ready to laugh?

12:16.654 --> 12:17.947
Okay. So,

12:18.239 --> 12:21.659
Feynman, Einstein and Schrodinger
walk into a bar.

12:21.909 --> 12:25.246
Feynman says,
"It appears we're inside a joke."

12:25.413 --> 12:30.042
Einstein replies, "But only to an observer
who saw us walk in simultaneously."

12:30.292 --> 12:34.547
To which Schrodinger says, "If someone
is looking in the window, I'm leaving."

12:38.509 --> 12:39.885
That's actually funny.

12:41.679 --> 12:44.098
You should send that to Jimmy Fallon.

12:46.183 --> 12:47.226
- Hey.
- Hello.

12:47.393 --> 12:49.103
- Hey, Bert. Yeah.
- Join us.

12:49.270 --> 12:51.522
Hey, sorry if last night was awkward.

12:51.689 --> 12:55.568
Actually, it got me thinking that
I shouldn't flaunt my money to find love.

12:55.818 --> 12:57.361
I might break up with Rebecca.

12:57.903 --> 12:59.029
Wow, that's a big step.

12:59.196 --> 13:01.031
I think it shows a lot of character.

13:01.449 --> 13:05.536
I'm gonna hold out and see if I can find a
hot young blonde who likes me for me.

13:05.828 --> 13:07.788
Good one.

13:12.668 --> 13:14.044
Okay now, Leonard, you tell a joke.

13:18.382 --> 13:21.260
<i>- How's she doing?</i>
- She's great. Here, look.

13:22.303 --> 13:25.139
<i>I see a wall, the floor,</i>

13:25.556 --> 13:26.807
<i>some Asian baby.</i>

13:27.808 --> 13:29.101
<i>There she is.</i>

13:29.435 --> 13:31.395
See? Nothing to worry about.

13:31.604 --> 13:34.190
<i>Thank you</i>. <i>OKay, I'm gonna try
and get some work done.</i>

13:34.523 --> 13:36.609
Yeah, me too. I love you.

13:36.901 --> 13:38.235
<i>Love you too, bye.</i>

13:46.035 --> 13:47.077
<i>How is she?</i>

13:51.707 --> 13:52.958
What are you doing here?

13:53.292 --> 13:55.669
Can't a guy hang out at a college
he doesn't go to

13:55.836 --> 13:57.087
and stare at a baby that isn't his?

13:59.673 --> 14:03.636
I get it,
I haven't even made it to my office yet.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.770
Is it weird if we just stand here
and watch her all day?

14:13.145 --> 14:14.313
Probably.

14:17.733 --> 14:18.901
We should go.

14:19.151 --> 14:20.194
Yeah.

14:22.613 --> 14:24.865
Or we could take her to the aquarium.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.951
I'll get her, you grab her bag.

14:27.576 --> 14:30.955
Hang on, Halley,
we're busting you out of there!

14:33.207 --> 14:34.458
What are you looking at?

14:34.750 --> 14:37.294
Comments from our
<i>Behind the Flags Retrospective.</i>

14:37.461 --> 14:40.631
Get this, people are calling it,
"The longest one yet."

14:43.509 --> 14:45.678
<i>Hello? Anybody home?</i>

14:45.844 --> 14:46.887
Is that Bert?

14:47.054 --> 14:48.097
<i>It's Bert.</i>

14:48.264 --> 14:49.682
I think it's Bert.

14:51.517 --> 14:52.810
Hey, what's up?

14:53.394 --> 14:55.104
I broke up with Rebecca.

14:55.771 --> 14:57.731
- Oh.
- Oh... Well, good for you.

14:58.190 --> 15:00.276
No. I miss her.

15:00.526 --> 15:02.111
I don't know why I listened to you.

15:03.279 --> 15:04.989
He's not wrong.

15:06.323 --> 15:08.951
It was your crackpot idea
that he deserves love.

15:11.370 --> 15:13.581
You know, you need to start
raising your hand before you speak.

15:16.417 --> 15:17.668
Yes, starting now.

15:19.545 --> 15:21.213
Bert, you're a good guy,
you deserve a woman

15:21.380 --> 15:23.048
who's interested in
more than just your money.

15:23.340 --> 15:26.343
She was also interested in walking
around my house in her underwear.

15:26.510 --> 15:28.345
Now the only one doing that is me.

15:32.224 --> 15:34.310
If you're that upset, go get her back.

15:34.893 --> 15:37.938
I tried, she's not answering my calls.

15:38.188 --> 15:40.733
Which really hurts
because I bought her that phone.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.820
I made a huge mistake.

15:45.029 --> 15:46.780
No, you didn't, okay?

15:46.947 --> 15:49.116
Look, Bert, when I had money,

15:49.283 --> 15:51.076
I dated lots of girls
who weren't right for me.

15:51.243 --> 15:53.329
And then I gave up my money,
and now I'm alone

15:53.495 --> 15:57.207
and living with my friends and somebody
else should probably talk now.

16:00.210 --> 16:03.380
Look, sweetie,
relationships aren't about money, okay?

16:03.547 --> 16:06.508
It's about respect
and having things in common and...

16:07.384 --> 16:08.510
Yes, Sheldon?

16:08.677 --> 16:11.889
You and Leonard don't have anything
in common, maybe you should break up.

16:14.391 --> 16:15.643
You called on him.

16:19.938 --> 16:22.691
Guess who's home from day care?

16:24.568 --> 16:29.031
It's Halley! Unless somebody else put
an "X" on the bottom of their kid's foot.

16:30.491 --> 16:32.409
You realize they called when you took her.

16:35.537 --> 16:38.374
Guess who's home from the aquarium?

16:42.461 --> 16:43.962
Sorry again for barging in.

16:44.129 --> 16:45.964
You don't have to go,
you're welcome to hang with us.

16:46.131 --> 16:48.926
But, actually, our friendship group
is at capacity.

16:49.093 --> 16:52.221
But if anybody drops out,
you are at the top of the list.

16:54.098 --> 16:58.686
Well, unless it's Raj, in which case
we'll probably get a person of color.

17:01.980 --> 17:04.775
You guys are nice,
but I'm just gonna buy Rebecca a jet ski

17:04.942 --> 17:06.735
and see if that gets her back.

17:08.696 --> 17:10.447
I feel bad for Bert.

17:11.115 --> 17:13.283
Well, so he's using his money
to attract a mate.

17:13.617 --> 17:16.412
Is that any different than me using
my intelligence to attract Amy?

17:16.578 --> 17:19.790
Or Leonard using his power of groveling
to get Penny?

17:21.625 --> 17:22.960
It's totally different.

17:23.127 --> 17:27.047
Bert's money might run out,
but I can beg until the end of time.

17:28.716 --> 17:31.552
All that and he's shorter than me.

17:34.847 --> 17:37.891
Sheldon, what did Amy have
that attracted you?

17:38.475 --> 17:39.643
So many things.

17:39.810 --> 17:44.314
Her mind, her kindness,
and especially her body.

17:45.149 --> 17:46.150
Really?

17:46.400 --> 17:49.903
Relax, we're the same blood type.
He knew he could harvest an organ.

18:01.331 --> 18:02.708
She does look happy.

18:03.292 --> 18:06.879
See, this is the right thing for her.
Let's all just go to work.

18:13.886 --> 18:15.304
Any time.

18:17.181 --> 18:18.682
Let me just say goodbye.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.603
Halley, look at Mommy.

18:24.313 --> 18:25.773
Over here, honey.

18:27.024 --> 18:29.026
Say goodbye to Mommy.

18:30.861 --> 18:33.363
Look at me. Look at your mother!

18:37.326 --> 18:38.660
Right, we can go.

18:42.706 --> 18:45.042
Hello. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.044
And I'm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.

18:47.377 --> 18:51.256
Based on the glowing reception of our
recent <i>Behind the Flags Retrospective,</i>

18:51.465 --> 18:54.051
we thought you might like to see
how it all came together.

18:54.384 --> 18:56.553
So welcome to tonight's episode...

18:58.055 --> 19:01.016
<i>"Fun with Flags,
Behind the Behind the Flags.</i>

19:01.183 --> 19:03.185
<i>"A Retrospective Retrospective."</i>

19:05.521 --> 19:07.773
- Oh, we already have our first call.
- Oh!

19:08.941 --> 19:11.151
Hello, you're on <i>Fun with Flags.</i>

19:11.985 --> 19:13.904
<i>The jet ski worked, I got her back.</i>

19:43.600 --> 19:44.601
