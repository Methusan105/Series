WEBVTT

00:04.214 --> 00:09.886
You know, downward-facing dog comes from
the Sanskrit phrase <i>adho mukha svanasana.</i>

00:10.387 --> 00:12.013
Oh, that's beautiful. What does it mean?

00:12.931 --> 00:14.224
"Downward-facing dog."

00:16.267 --> 00:19.437
Yeah, I guess they don't have Sanskrit
for "butts up and heads down."

00:20.355 --> 00:21.773
Hey, we wrote the <i>Kama Sutra.</i>

00:21.981 --> 00:23.942
If it involves butts,
there's a word for it.

00:25.985 --> 00:27.445
I thought we were getting breakfast
before work.

00:27.862 --> 00:28.988
Oh, right, sorry.

00:29.239 --> 00:31.324
It's my fault,
I asked Penny to do yoga with me.

00:31.574 --> 00:33.159
You know, if you want,
I can get ready in five minutes.

00:33.410 --> 00:34.911
It's cute that you think that.

00:36.454 --> 00:37.455
Don't worry about it.

00:37.664 --> 00:39.958
Hey, can I ask a favor?
Would you mind taking Cinnamon for a walk?

00:40.417 --> 00:42.836
Sure. You're living here for free,
I guess I owe you.

00:45.255 --> 00:47.132
Bye, Cinnamon, be a good girl.

00:47.340 --> 00:48.675
- Yeah, bye, sweetie.
- Bye.

00:48.842 --> 00:50.093
Yeah, yeah, bye, Leonard.

00:52.429 --> 00:55.473
Okay, and tree pose.

00:57.684 --> 00:59.018
Well, she's done.

01:28.423 --> 01:32.218
Things have been going really well
with the infinite persistence gyroscope.

01:32.510 --> 01:33.803
That's great, how so?

01:34.554 --> 01:36.848
Oh, the project is classified,
I can't tell you.

01:37.766 --> 01:40.685
Oh, I suppose I could redact
the classified parts.

01:41.436 --> 01:44.898
All right.
Um, I came up with an elegant solution

01:45.064 --> 01:47.400
to the reduction of scale problem.

01:48.234 --> 01:51.696
I used the nonlinear dynamics...

01:51.863 --> 01:54.866
...and then I generated flow vortices...

01:55.033 --> 01:57.702
...using a higher temperature
Bose-Einstein condensate,

01:58.077 --> 01:59.370
and that did it.

02:01.956 --> 02:03.708
Wow. Wonder what they're redacting.

02:06.044 --> 02:07.796
Why don't you ask me what I'm working on?

02:08.254 --> 02:10.548
Oh, very well.
What have you been working on?

02:10.757 --> 02:12.842
And feel free to honk
during the boring parts.

02:14.260 --> 02:17.472
I'm doing some experiments
to show that the signal to move a muscle

02:17.722 --> 02:19.891
occurs before you know
you even decided to move it.

02:20.433 --> 02:24.646
What... So you're attempting to pinpoint
where consciousness resides in the brain?

02:25.063 --> 02:28.441
Yes. I'm trying to figure out,
to the nanometer and the attosecond,

02:28.650 --> 02:31.236
precisely where and when
an event of awareness takes place.

02:32.570 --> 02:33.822
Well, what do you know?

02:34.072 --> 02:36.366
Here I was,
waiting to be bored with biology,

02:36.574 --> 02:39.077
and instead,
you tickle my intellectual fancy.

02:39.452 --> 02:42.413
Which, unlike my body,
is an okay place to tickle.

02:44.958 --> 02:45.959
You know, when I was six,

02:46.167 --> 02:48.670
I wanted to marry the gorilla
from <i>Good Night, Gorilla.</i>

02:49.838 --> 02:51.047
Maybe I was onto something.

02:54.717 --> 02:58.555
Gentlemen, the most interesting thing
just happened with this spoon.

02:58.930 --> 03:01.140
Unless it was singing <i>Be our Guest,</i>
I doubt it.

03:03.351 --> 03:05.728
No, I picked it up
without thinking about it,

03:05.895 --> 03:08.022
which raises a neuroscientific question.

03:08.231 --> 03:09.899
When did I decide to pick it up?

03:10.275 --> 03:12.193
The bigger question is,
what are you gonna eat with that spoon?

03:12.443 --> 03:13.820
You didn't get any food.

03:16.030 --> 03:17.615
He does raise an interesting point.

03:18.157 --> 03:21.578
Amy is studying the time lag
between intent and awareness,

03:21.786 --> 03:24.998
and I realized that applies to the
measurement problem in quantum mechanics.

03:25.248 --> 03:27.458
Now, I recognize there will be a time lag

03:27.625 --> 03:30.628
between me saying that and you googling
what it means, so I'll wait.

03:32.630 --> 03:33.673
I understand it, Sheldon.

03:33.882 --> 03:35.133
Yeah, me, too.

03:35.633 --> 03:38.094
I'm sorry, I spaced.
Are we still talking about the spoon?

03:39.929 --> 03:42.640
It's nice to see you taking an interest
in Amy's work.

03:42.974 --> 03:44.017
Well, don't get me wrong,

03:44.225 --> 03:47.353
neurobiology is nothing more than
the science of gray squishy stuff.

03:47.562 --> 03:49.522
But you know, when it connects to physics,

03:49.731 --> 03:51.774
"Gas up the Ford, Martha,
we're going for a drive!"

03:55.987 --> 03:57.447
So, did you confront Jennifer?

03:57.655 --> 03:59.324
No, I was going to,
but she called in sick.

03:59.490 --> 04:00.783
And guess who else called in sick.

04:01.034 --> 04:02.535
- Paul?
- Paul.

04:02.869 --> 04:03.870
Who's Paul?

04:04.078 --> 04:06.456
Oh, you met him at the office
Christmas party, he's married to Nancy.

04:06.664 --> 04:08.750
Oh, sure. Wait, Nancy?

04:09.834 --> 04:11.920
I bet Jennifer gets a promotion
out of this, which is so unfair,

04:12.086 --> 04:13.796
because I work twice as hard as she does.

04:14.005 --> 04:17.050
Don't worry, Jerry won't be fooled
by that type of behavior.

04:21.596 --> 04:22.931
- Jerry?
- Wait.

04:23.514 --> 04:26.309
It didn't work for Randy,
it didn't work for Tina,

04:26.517 --> 04:28.353
it sure as hell
isn't gonna work for Jennifer.

04:28.519 --> 04:31.898
Well, I hope not. I just hate
when people play those kinds of games.

04:33.691 --> 04:35.026
Tina?

04:35.735 --> 04:37.820
With your sales record,
you have nothing to worry about.

04:37.987 --> 04:38.988
Hmm.

04:40.365 --> 04:42.033
I went to your office Christmas party?

04:46.371 --> 04:48.539
You know, I like harp lessons,

04:49.123 --> 04:51.501
but I'm thinking of
switching to elevator repair lessons.

04:54.253 --> 04:55.254
What are you working on?

04:56.130 --> 04:59.759
I was thinking about your experiment
on the neuroscience of decision-making,

04:59.968 --> 05:04.305
and I realized, if we connect it to the
measurement problem in quantum mechanics,

05:04.514 --> 05:06.724
we have a chance to disprove
the role of consciousness

05:06.891 --> 05:08.226
in the Copenhagen interpretation.

05:09.560 --> 05:13.106
Wait, are you saying if we combine
my experiment with your calculations,

05:13.398 --> 05:15.274
we can determine
the precise moment in time

05:15.483 --> 05:16.985
when the wave function collapses?

05:17.235 --> 05:20.738
It could be the most inspired combination
since I mixed red Icee into my blue Icee.

05:24.409 --> 05:26.077
It was like drinking
two-sevenths of the rainbow.

05:28.162 --> 05:29.414
Sheldon, this is really interesting.

05:29.622 --> 05:31.249
Yeah, and this one
won't stain my teeth purple.

05:33.418 --> 05:35.878
You know, we've
never collaborated professionally before.

05:36.087 --> 05:38.089
Are you worried
it might affect our relationship?

05:38.589 --> 05:40.049
That is a valid point.

05:40.299 --> 05:42.719
Oh. Perhaps we should establish
some ground rules.

05:43.219 --> 05:44.220
Well, that would make me feel better.

05:44.512 --> 05:45.513
All right, let's start right now.

05:45.763 --> 05:49.017
Uh, rule number one,
no using sexuality to get your way.

05:51.352 --> 05:52.603
That's a ridiculous rule.

05:52.812 --> 05:54.022
Is it?

06:01.612 --> 06:03.281
Okay, how is that?

06:09.370 --> 06:13.374
I can actually feel
the toxins being pulled out of my skin.

06:14.459 --> 06:16.419
Well, this is a moisturizing mask.

06:16.919 --> 06:21.007
Ah, well, then I can actually feel
the moisture going into my skin.

06:22.550 --> 06:25.219
Hey, I hope you don't mind, I used
a little of your eye cream last night.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.722
I thought someone looked
brighter and tighter.

06:34.020 --> 06:35.521
Still like to know who Jerry is.

06:36.856 --> 06:38.149
No, don't worry about it. Hey, after this,

06:38.357 --> 06:39.901
how about we all go out
and do something together?

06:40.359 --> 06:41.986
That would be great, thank you.

06:42.737 --> 06:43.738
You wanna go shopping?

06:44.030 --> 06:45.156
Ooh! Yes, fun!

06:45.364 --> 06:49.118
Or we could do something we'll all enjoy,
like play a board game.

07:26.531 --> 07:29.242
Oh, I believe I've made some progress
on our ground rules.

07:29.534 --> 07:30.993
Oh, good. What are they?

07:31.369 --> 07:35.373
Okay. Uh, number one, in matters
of physics, I have the final say.

07:35.540 --> 07:38.417
Now, in matters of neuroscience,
you have the final say.

07:38.584 --> 07:39.627
Unless I disagree.

07:41.170 --> 07:45.049
Oh, here. Number two, when we publish,
my name goes first.

07:45.258 --> 07:48.010
Oh, subsequently, if we win any awards,
I speak first.

07:48.219 --> 07:50.054
I don't want to be talking
when the orchestra plays us off.

07:52.223 --> 07:54.058
- Can I see that?
- Of course.

08:00.398 --> 08:01.691
I'll get that back.

08:03.025 --> 08:06.070
Like all my underwear, that notebook says,
"Property of Sheldon Cooper."

08:07.738 --> 08:10.575
Sheldon, if we're gonna have ground rules,
I'll tell you the first ground rule.

08:10.741 --> 08:11.868
I make the ground rules.

08:12.952 --> 08:14.745
I'd write that down,
but I can't now, can I?

08:19.167 --> 08:20.751
I mean, they didn't say anything,

08:20.918 --> 08:23.880
but I just kinda felt
like I was being a weird third wheel.

08:24.672 --> 08:27.925
Oh. So you can tell
what that feels like. Interesting.

08:29.635 --> 08:33.598
Anyway, I figured I can hang out
with my friends and have fun, too.

08:34.265 --> 08:37.435
Well, if your idea of fun is riding
in a minivan to Target for diapers,

08:37.602 --> 08:39.228
things are about to get nuts.

08:41.230 --> 08:44.442
Oh, it's just nice to be with people
who are happy to have me around.

08:44.775 --> 08:45.943
Isn't that right, Halley?

08:49.989 --> 08:52.116
At least someone had the courage
to say it.

08:54.994 --> 08:56.996
Thank you, you are a good citizen.

08:57.955 --> 08:58.956
Told you!

08:59.916 --> 09:02.710
Go ahead, throw my underwear
out the window, same thing's gonna happen.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.964
Terrific. Do you wanna hear
our new set of ground rules?

09:07.298 --> 09:08.507
Fire away.

09:08.966 --> 09:12.428
Number one, we're on the same team,
we're not in competition.

09:12.637 --> 09:15.932
That's smart,
because Sheldon one, Amy zero.

09:17.683 --> 09:20.186
Number two,
disagreements can happen politely,

09:20.519 --> 09:22.521
there's no need to call an idea stupid.

09:23.147 --> 09:24.982
Oh... Someone drew a penis in it.

09:28.861 --> 09:30.863
- Are you listening?
- I'm sorry, go ahead.

09:31.322 --> 09:34.951
Number three, to avoid getting frustrated,
we take built-in breaks

09:35.117 --> 09:37.036
and reward our successes
with a small treat.

09:37.370 --> 09:38.913
Ooh, that sounds fun.

09:39.205 --> 09:40.790
Now, we're talking
about real treats, right?

09:40.998 --> 09:42.750
Not Bible verses,
like my mother used to give me.

09:45.086 --> 09:48.673
Whatever you want.
So, shall we get to work?

09:49.048 --> 09:51.259
Biology and physics coming together?

09:51.467 --> 09:53.511
It's like
the peanut butter cup of the mind.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.347
Oh, I know what I want my treat to be!

10:41.017 --> 10:42.977
Wow. Look at that.

10:43.185 --> 10:45.062
Yes, this is remarkable.

10:46.063 --> 10:48.399
So we're agreed, it's complete garbage.

10:51.485 --> 10:53.154
By the way, your name can go first.

11:01.412 --> 11:02.997
I mean, I'm glad they're getting along,

11:03.205 --> 11:04.790
but it's starting
to make me uncomfortable.

11:05.082 --> 11:07.376
Well, are you worried
he's like another man in her life?

11:07.543 --> 11:10.171
A little, until I saw them
in matching tops, so...

11:11.881 --> 11:15.968
Nice, 174 diapers.
That ought to get us to Wednesday.

11:18.637 --> 11:19.972
Well, have you talked to them about it?

11:20.222 --> 11:23.100
What am I supposed to say?
"Stop having fun without me"?

11:23.768 --> 11:25.603
This one says that every time I go out.

11:26.729 --> 11:28.147
See? I listen to you.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.194
Look, Raj just gets along with women.

11:33.444 --> 11:35.654
Yeah, I know, but he was my friend first.

11:35.821 --> 11:38.908
It's like she's stealing him
and they're just having the best time

11:39.116 --> 11:41.202
doing all their dumb girly stuff together.

11:41.952 --> 11:44.205
You sure you don't fit in?
You sound like a catty bitch to me.

11:51.337 --> 11:52.630
I don't know where we went wrong.

11:52.838 --> 11:56.675
The math is so inelegant,
I'm not even sure it makes sense.

11:58.594 --> 12:00.262
Well, don't give up, maybe we can fix it.

12:07.019 --> 12:10.439
Can you stop breathing so loud?
I can hear your nose whistling.

12:12.149 --> 12:14.318
I can hear your face talking,
so we're even.

12:20.950 --> 12:24.495
All right, either blow your nose
or teach it to play <i>Camptown Races.</i>

12:26.372 --> 12:29.834
Fine. Fine, you want me to blow my nose?
Here, I'll blow it.

12:35.589 --> 12:36.590
Better?

12:36.841 --> 12:38.008
No, I can still hear it.

12:39.343 --> 12:40.970
Oh, wait, that's me.
Never mind, it's fine.

12:42.263 --> 12:44.932
You know, you're exhausting!
I knew working together was a bad idea.

12:45.099 --> 12:48.018
Hold on. I see what's wrong here.

12:48.185 --> 12:50.354
We did the propagation
only to the occipital lobe,

12:50.604 --> 12:52.022
not to the prefrontal cortex.

12:53.190 --> 12:58.654
That would mean that this delay parameter
should be increased 250 milliseconds.

12:58.863 --> 13:01.198
Oh. That is much better.

13:01.866 --> 13:05.035
Boy, if good ideas came out of your brain
the way mucus comes out of your nose,

13:05.202 --> 13:06.203
we'd be in good shape.

13:11.041 --> 13:14.879
Now, take a sip,
swirl it around your mouth,

13:15.087 --> 13:19.049
and try to notice the flavors,
the tannins, the textures.

13:23.345 --> 13:24.513
Well?

13:24.680 --> 13:26.807
I probably should've
spit out my gum first.

13:32.271 --> 13:36.192
Yeah. You know, the last couple of weeks
have been pretty rough,

13:36.400 --> 13:39.236
but staying here with you guys
has really helped take my mind off of it.

13:39.653 --> 13:42.323
Well, we've loved having you around.
Right, sweetie?

13:45.534 --> 13:47.912
- Leonard?
- Yeah, when did he leave?

13:48.162 --> 13:49.580
Yeah, that's rude.

13:53.167 --> 13:54.668
You know,
it's nice to spend time with people

13:54.877 --> 13:58.130
who don't talk about work
like it's some kind of soap opera.

13:58.589 --> 14:00.883
Jennifer still trying
to sleep her way to the top?

14:03.469 --> 14:04.678
Yeah.

14:06.055 --> 14:09.642
You should be happy someone wants to
do the stuff with Penny you don't want to.

14:10.059 --> 14:11.644
Yeah, I wish I had that with Howard.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.605
What? What do I make you do?

14:14.980 --> 14:18.359
Let's see, the magic store,
the <i>Doctor Who</i> convention,

14:18.609 --> 14:21.278
the National Belt Buckle Collectors
meet-and-greet.

14:23.197 --> 14:25.199
It said right there on the invitation,
"Buckle up for fun!"

14:25.449 --> 14:26.784
It's not my fault you didn't listen.

14:29.620 --> 14:30.996
I'm sure I'm overreacting.

14:31.497 --> 14:33.165
You're entitled to feel how you feel.

14:33.415 --> 14:35.292
If you don't like it,
you should just talk to her.

14:35.626 --> 14:37.670
I don't want to sound like a jealous baby.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.130
Oh. Then maybe you shouldn't talk to her.

14:43.092 --> 14:45.511
You know, I had a feeling you were using
the wrong computational model,

14:45.719 --> 14:47.721
but I didn't say anything
'cause you're so sensitive!

14:48.305 --> 14:51.100
Just because I'm easily bothered
by light, heat, sound, smell

14:51.308 --> 14:53.352
and the way birds look at me
does not mean I'm sensitive!

14:55.563 --> 14:56.647
Hey.

14:57.106 --> 14:59.316
I wonder what kind of success we'd have

14:59.567 --> 15:02.695
if we defined "measurement"
as the first moment

15:02.903 --> 15:05.447
that an action potential
is seen by the visual cortex.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.659
That is a daring and insightful solution.

15:09.868 --> 15:12.830
We're finally making progress.
I wish we could do it without fighting.

15:14.039 --> 15:16.500
What if the fighting is the reason
we're making progress?

15:18.419 --> 15:19.753
I suppose it's conceivable

15:19.920 --> 15:22.631
that the hormones associated
with our fight-or-flight response

15:22.798 --> 15:25.050
could be sharpening
our cognitive processes.

15:26.010 --> 15:27.386
Well, if that's the case,

15:27.553 --> 15:30.014
then your grandparents mumble
and have bad posture.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.185
How dare you speak that way
about my Grammy and...

15:35.394 --> 15:37.146
Hey, wait a second, wait.

15:40.316 --> 15:43.485
Delta T could equal alpha subzero.

15:45.863 --> 15:47.615
It seems we have a choice to make.

15:48.866 --> 15:51.702
Abandon all ground rules
in the name of science,

15:52.077 --> 15:55.664
or give up collaborating
for the sake of our relationship.

15:57.499 --> 15:58.876
There's only one clear choice.

15:59.460 --> 16:01.045
- Science it is.
- No, you bonehead!

16:03.255 --> 16:04.548
Name-calling, that is perfect!

16:04.715 --> 16:07.301
Now, when I get to this equation here,
really let me have it.

16:07.509 --> 16:09.303
Now, it... If it helps,
I'm not the sharpest dresser.

16:13.515 --> 16:15.059
Anyway, I know it's silly,

16:15.267 --> 16:18.312
but since Raj moved in,
I've been feeling a little left out.

16:22.191 --> 16:24.943
Well, sweetie, that's crazy.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.071
No, no, Penny, don't dismiss his feelings.

16:27.363 --> 16:28.739
- Thank you. I just feel like...
- Hang on.

16:28.906 --> 16:32.076
I'm not saying
that his feelings aren't crazy,

16:32.242 --> 16:34.495
I just don't want him to think
that this isn't a safe place.

16:34.912 --> 16:35.913
Well, to be truthful, lately...

16:36.080 --> 16:37.247
<i>Well,
why wouldn't this be a safe place?</i>

16:37.414 --> 16:39.416
I mean, he's surrounded by his wife
and one of his best friends.

16:39.875 --> 16:41.377
- I don't wanna speak for Leonard.
- Thank you. I...

16:41.627 --> 16:43.420
But when you're insecure,

16:43.712 --> 16:46.590
no amount of external validation
can ever make you feel safe.

16:46.882 --> 16:48.092
Yeah, you're right. You know,

16:48.300 --> 16:50.260
you're really sensitive
about this kind of stuff.

16:50.594 --> 16:52.262
- I'm a good listener.
- Yeah.

16:52.888 --> 16:54.348
Hey, Olsen twins.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.894
- What?
- Well,

16:59.103 --> 17:01.647
I'm sitting right here!
You're talking about my feelings

17:01.897 --> 17:03.774
and somehow leaving me
out of the conversation!

17:04.024 --> 17:06.151
I'm sorry, what did you want to say?

17:06.944 --> 17:08.612
I don't know, you pretty much covered it.

17:17.663 --> 17:18.872
Can you read them back?

17:19.790 --> 17:21.625
Revised ground rule number one,

17:21.959 --> 17:24.461
we are on the same team,
but it is a competition.

17:27.172 --> 17:28.424
Excellent. Excellent.

17:28.590 --> 17:31.093
Now, on a related point,
you're going down, punk.

17:32.970 --> 17:34.805
Revised ground rule number two,

17:35.013 --> 17:37.141
there are definitely stupid questions

17:37.599 --> 17:41.145
and those who ask them can be told so
right to their stupid face.

17:43.355 --> 17:44.732
I love that one.

17:46.984 --> 17:48.193
Thanks, babe.

17:49.403 --> 17:51.989
Number three,
fair topics for insult include

17:52.239 --> 17:58.078
educational pedigree, scientific field,
intellectual prowess and mamas.

18:00.164 --> 18:02.082
That list is strong.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.669
Like your mother's urge
to be promiscuous with sailors.

18:36.700 --> 18:37.701
English - SDH
