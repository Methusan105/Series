00:02.170 --> 00:03.505
<i>Previously on</i> The Big Bang Theory...

00:04.964 --> 00:09.386
<i>Stop crying. I'm begging you.
I don't know what else to do.</i>

00:09.969 --> 00:12.555
<i>My boobs are empty. Do you want lasagna?</i>

00:16.476 --> 00:19.896
<i>It's okay. It's okay.</i>

00:27.612 --> 00:28.697
What have we done?

00:35.954 --> 00:37.372
What's all this?

00:37.580 --> 00:39.666
Well, it sounded like
you were having a rough day,

00:39.833 --> 00:42.168
so I wanted you to come home
to something nice.

00:42.502 --> 00:44.754
Oh, that is so thoughtful.

00:45.255 --> 00:47.716
Hey, do you remember when we went
wine tasting in Santa Barbara

00:47.924 --> 00:49.592
and you said that was the best rose
you'd ever had?

00:49.801 --> 00:54.806
Yeah, I remember us driving up there,
going to the winery and that's it.

00:56.641 --> 00:58.476
- This wine is why.
- Oh!

01:00.186 --> 01:01.479
Hey, what smells so good?

01:01.646 --> 01:05.108
Oh, I made your favorite. Pizza bagels.

01:06.609 --> 01:10.321
Pink wine and pizza bagels!
It's like eighth grade all over again!

01:11.614 --> 01:13.199
I am so lucky to have you.

01:13.366 --> 01:14.868
Well, be careful. These are hot.

01:15.034 --> 01:18.997
I could explain the thermodynamics of
why the cheese seems hotter than the crust

01:19.164 --> 01:20.832
but instead
I'm going to keep it to myself.

01:21.124 --> 01:24.252
Oh! You always know what not to say.

01:25.754 --> 01:27.338
I just... I can't believe you did all this.

01:27.797 --> 01:31.217
Well, you know, it's easy to take
each other for granted

01:31.384 --> 01:34.220
and I never wanna do that
to you because...

01:35.430 --> 01:38.475
Your love, it's like a river.

01:39.184 --> 01:41.352
It's peaceful and deep.

01:42.312 --> 01:46.357
Your soul is... It's like a secret
that I never could keep.

01:48.526 --> 01:50.487
You did not just quote an *NSYNC song.

01:52.655 --> 01:54.240
I quoted your favorite *NSYNC song.

01:55.700 --> 01:56.910
Ohh!

02:07.045 --> 02:09.881
Damn. I burped so hard I died in my game.

02:38.910 --> 02:42.997
Leonard, I've been meaning to ask you.
What size shoe do you wear?

02:43.414 --> 02:44.457
Why?

02:44.624 --> 02:47.460
I'm trying to take more of an interest
in other people's lives.

02:50.421 --> 02:52.090
That's nice.
I wear a size eight and a half.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.925
That's small.

02:56.594 --> 02:59.681
So, tell me,
do you have any plans for the weekend?

02:59.931 --> 03:01.558
Are you gonna laugh at the answer?

03:01.850 --> 03:04.143
Only if the answer is
"Shopping for baby shoes."

03:07.063 --> 03:11.109
If you must know, Penny won a spa weekend
from work and she's taking me.

03:11.359 --> 03:13.194
Oh, well, that is interesting.

03:13.361 --> 03:15.613
Now I wonder what kind of infection
you'll come home with.

03:17.824 --> 03:19.117
My money's on fungal.

03:22.245 --> 03:24.706
They're still having girls'
night across the hall.

03:25.290 --> 03:27.208
So, hang out with me
and we'll have boys' night.

03:28.167 --> 03:30.545
At our age,
why don't we call it man's night?

03:31.963 --> 03:34.007
Because we just spent our
allowance on comic books.

03:38.636 --> 03:41.264
Penny, is it weird
that we're having girls' night here

03:41.431 --> 03:43.975
but you don't live here anymore,
so it's basically my girls' night?

03:44.642 --> 03:45.768
Hadn't really thought about it.

03:45.935 --> 03:48.313
But now you're thinking about it
and it bothers you. I get that.

03:52.233 --> 03:54.110
Things going well with
you and Sheldon living together?

03:54.402 --> 03:55.403
Better than ever.

03:55.612 --> 03:58.156
He asks about my day,
takes an interest in my life.

03:58.489 --> 03:59.908
He's like my boyfriend in college

04:00.074 --> 04:02.118
except he's real so people can see him.

04:05.121 --> 04:07.832
I've been seeing him for years.
I'm still not convinced he's real.

04:10.835 --> 04:13.338
Hey, can I ask you a question?
You've been married for a while.

04:13.504 --> 04:17.175
Is it normal for the husband
to kind of completely stop giving a crap?

04:18.593 --> 04:20.637
Uh-oh, what's going on?

04:21.179 --> 04:25.099
Leonard used to do all these things,
like bring me flowers and wear pants.

04:27.185 --> 04:29.103
It's okay, Howie never has on pants.

04:30.188 --> 04:32.607
The Domino's guy
brings the pizza like this now.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.027
Well, Sheldon always has his pants on.

04:36.194 --> 04:37.904
I don't think I could pick
his knees out of a lineup.

04:39.614 --> 04:41.199
No, it's not just the pants.

04:41.366 --> 04:43.826
It's like since we got married,
he doesn't really try anymore.

04:44.369 --> 04:47.038
Uh, Penny, I don't know how to say this,

04:47.455 --> 04:50.083
but this is my first girls' night, and
you're kind of bumming everybody out.

04:55.129 --> 04:56.756
All right, got Halley to sleep.

04:57.131 --> 04:58.633
I heard you on the baby monitor.

04:59.050 --> 05:01.970
Didn't think you could turn the theme
from <i>Walking Dead</i> into a lullaby.

05:04.389 --> 05:08.434
Got to get her hooked on TV,
or someday she'll want me to play outside.

05:09.894 --> 05:12.563
Boy, that floor is so squeaky.

05:12.730 --> 05:15.066
Surprised I didn't wake her up
walking out of the room.

05:15.650 --> 05:16.943
Have you tried anything to fix it?

05:17.694 --> 05:19.821
Oh, I put the rug down. Didn't help.

05:20.238 --> 05:22.407
I know. Blue shag.
What were you thinking?

05:25.451 --> 05:27.954
Did try nailing
a couple of the boards down.

05:28.371 --> 05:29.998
- Did that do anything?
- Yeah.

05:30.164 --> 05:32.000
Left little holes in the floor.
That's why I bought the rug.

05:41.009 --> 05:43.261
If you do that, I'll win in eight moves.

05:51.561 --> 05:52.729
I'll win in five moves.

05:59.610 --> 06:00.611
I'll win in one move.

06:03.906 --> 06:05.199
Oh, no! Good game.

06:09.245 --> 06:10.329
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:10.496 --> 06:14.250
Oh, Penny. I'm trying to take an interest
in other people.

06:14.542 --> 06:15.918
How was your girls' night?

06:16.085 --> 06:17.336
It was fine.

06:17.795 --> 06:19.130
Did you have anything to eat?

06:19.464 --> 06:20.715
Uh, chips.

06:21.215 --> 06:22.675
Anything to drink?

06:23.301 --> 06:24.635
Some wine.

06:25.094 --> 06:26.971
Boy, I'm just playing tennis
against the drapes here.

06:29.557 --> 06:30.641
Just ignore him.

06:30.808 --> 06:32.268
Mmm, at least he took an interest.

06:33.061 --> 06:34.437
What's that supposed to mean?

06:34.687 --> 06:35.730
Nothing.

06:35.938 --> 06:36.981
Hey, what's going on with you?

06:37.523 --> 06:38.566
I don't wanna talk about it.

06:38.733 --> 06:40.276
Oh, hey, come on. Just tell me.

06:41.778 --> 06:45.698
Fine. Lately, I kind of feel like
you've been taking me for granted.

06:47.158 --> 06:48.576
What? Where is this coming from?

06:48.826 --> 06:51.037
Leonard, she might be drunk.
All she had was chips.

06:53.081 --> 06:54.248
It's just, since we got married,

06:54.415 --> 06:56.501
you seem to think
you don't have to try anymore.

06:57.335 --> 06:58.586
That is ridiculous.

06:58.795 --> 07:00.088
This is exactly why
I didn't want to talk about it.

07:00.296 --> 07:01.923
No, no, no. Let's talk about it.

07:02.090 --> 07:05.259
I'm the one who's made all the effort
in this relationship since day one.

07:05.426 --> 07:07.220
Please tell me what more I could do.

07:07.720 --> 07:08.763
Okay, you know what?

07:08.930 --> 07:11.307
Maybe I'll take Amy with me to the spa
this weekend instead.

07:12.850 --> 07:14.310
All right. Go ahead.

07:18.231 --> 07:19.690
Amy is free.

07:22.527 --> 07:25.488
She had a harp lesson on Saturday
but it got canceled.

07:26.030 --> 07:30.493
Boy, when you take an interest in people
you really uncork a geyser of nonsense.

07:35.123 --> 07:36.541
Okay. Thanks, Daddy.

07:37.834 --> 07:40.419
He said the only way to really fix
an old floor like that

07:40.628 --> 07:42.213
is to tear it up
and replace the whole thing.

07:42.547 --> 07:43.756
That sounds expensive.

07:43.923 --> 07:48.052
Hang on. No offense to her father,
but he's not an MIT-trained engineer.

07:48.219 --> 07:49.762
Thinking and building is what you do.

07:50.054 --> 07:53.224
MIT's motto is "Mind and Hand."
Which, just so happens,

07:53.391 --> 07:55.226
was also my motto as a lonely teenager.

07:57.562 --> 08:00.148
Oh, come on,
we just need to be more creative.

08:00.731 --> 08:03.901
What if you didn't
step on the floor at all?

08:04.193 --> 08:07.613
Like, what if you swung on a rope
from the ceiling?

08:09.949 --> 08:11.617
Uh...

08:15.788 --> 08:16.873
No.

08:17.456 --> 08:18.666
Okay. Um...

08:19.458 --> 08:21.377
Okay, what if you rig up a pulley system

08:21.544 --> 08:23.671
and move yourself across the room
in a harness?

08:23.963 --> 08:25.173
Oh!

08:36.601 --> 08:37.643
No.

08:39.812 --> 08:40.855
I have one.

08:41.105 --> 08:44.317
What if you got a giant slingshot
and flung yourself into the wall?

08:46.611 --> 08:48.279
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- Hold on.

08:56.204 --> 08:57.371
Yeah, that's funny.

09:00.333 --> 09:02.460
- All right, we're heading out.
- Mmm-hmm.

09:03.544 --> 09:04.962
I'll call you when we get to the hotel.

09:05.129 --> 09:07.423
And if they have
any of those tiny bottles of shampoo?

09:07.590 --> 09:10.301
I will bring them home so you can
show me how Godzilla takes a shower.

09:12.762 --> 09:14.555
- Have fun.
- Thanks. Are you ready?

09:14.889 --> 09:16.015
Uh-huh.

09:16.432 --> 09:17.516
Bye, Sheldon.

09:18.142 --> 09:21.145
You know what? I feel uncomfortable
engaging in a public display of affection

09:21.312 --> 09:23.147
while their relationship is strained.

09:24.523 --> 09:25.816
Go ahead. It's fine.

09:27.151 --> 09:28.361
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:35.368 --> 09:36.869
- Okay.
- Let's go.

09:40.665 --> 09:42.166
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:42.667 --> 09:43.668
I'll miss you.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.920
- I'll miss you, too.
- I'll miss you more.

09:46.087 --> 09:49.465
Well, if X equals the amount that you'll
miss me, then I'll miss you X plus one.

09:51.133 --> 09:52.802
If you miss me X plus one,
I'll miss you

09:52.969 --> 09:54.845
open paren X plus one,
close paren...

09:58.557 --> 09:59.558
Thank you.

10:07.692 --> 10:10.569
Here. You're sad, so I made you tea.

10:12.613 --> 10:13.614
Thanks.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.199
And it's just the way you like it.

10:15.366 --> 10:16.409
- Earl Grey?
- Yes.

10:16.575 --> 10:18.160
- Honey? Unsweetened...
- Yes.

10:18.327 --> 10:19.870
Good Lord, I made you tea, just drink it.

10:23.124 --> 10:24.750
Sorry. Thank you.

10:26.669 --> 10:28.379
Oh, what can we do to cheer you up?

10:28.879 --> 10:30.339
I really don't know.

10:31.299 --> 10:34.093
Do you want to play <i>Jenga?</i>
Or <i>Ticket to Ride?</i>

10:34.385 --> 10:38.764
<i>Hearthstone?</i> What would you be
the happiest losing at?

10:42.476 --> 10:45.021
- I don't want to play a game, Sheldon.
- Wow!

10:45.938 --> 10:48.024
I remember when
you loved playing games with me.

10:48.733 --> 10:50.985
Maybe Penny isn't the only relationship
you're phoning in.

10:54.071 --> 10:58.659
It's not that I'd stopped trying.
It's just how relationships progress.

10:59.118 --> 11:02.955
They start with infatuation, but over time
mellow into something more comfortable.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.500
Mmm, yeah, you're right.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.420
It's like when I first encountered
the Pythagorean theorem.

11:09.754 --> 11:14.383
I was blown away that the square of the
hypotenuse was the sum of the squares

11:14.550 --> 11:17.136
of the opposite sides.
Yeah, but now I'm just like... Eh!

11:22.933 --> 11:25.519
Okay, this grid represents the room.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.897
All we need to do is plot out

11:28.064 --> 11:31.317
where each squeak is
and we can find a quiet path to the crib.

11:35.237 --> 11:37.615
Looks like a map
from <i>Dungeons & Dragons.</i>

11:38.199 --> 11:41.744
Mmm... Except the creature in the crib
is a level nine poop monster.

11:42.036 --> 11:46.290
Okay, you check for squeaks,
and I will mark them down.

11:46.791 --> 11:50.127
Okay. Space A3. Here we go.

11:54.632 --> 11:56.175
It's squeaking, mark it.

11:56.467 --> 11:58.844
It's nice to think
that you grew up in this room

11:59.011 --> 12:00.805
and now your daughter
is going to as well.

12:01.180 --> 12:04.975
Mmm. I hope she has the same
amount of sex in it I did.

12:05.184 --> 12:06.477
None. Next square.

12:09.355 --> 12:11.690
Why do you bounce
with your hands in the air like that?

12:12.066 --> 12:14.527
It's a tradition of my people.

12:20.491 --> 12:24.203
<i>Material Girl</i> needs to be retired.
That is your karaoke song.

12:28.791 --> 12:31.210
Would you like to play
a driving game I invented?

12:32.294 --> 12:34.755
Is it about the failing state
of my relationship with Penny?

12:36.340 --> 12:37.883
Never mind.

12:39.969 --> 12:42.513
You know, Penny went to this spa
to be away from you.

12:42.680 --> 12:44.306
Are you sure you should be going there?

12:44.473 --> 12:46.809
I don't want to wait two days
for us to work this out.

12:48.102 --> 12:50.604
Very well.
And you got married spur of the moment.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.857
I don't see why your divorce
should be any different.

12:54.817 --> 12:57.027
I would pull this car over
and kick you out

12:57.778 --> 12:59.488
but if Penny dumps me, you're all I got.

13:04.702 --> 13:06.370
When was the last time
you got a massage?

13:06.954 --> 13:08.789
Sheldon walked on my back two weeks ago

13:08.956 --> 13:10.833
but that was just 'cause
there was a spider on his pillow

13:11.000 --> 13:12.084
and he was trying to get away.

13:14.003 --> 13:15.546
Leonard stood on me once, too.

13:15.713 --> 13:17.298
But he was just trying to see
the Rose Parade.

13:20.217 --> 13:21.343
I don't know the protocol.

13:21.552 --> 13:23.053
Are you gonna be naked
for your massage?

13:23.512 --> 13:24.597
Yeah.

13:25.014 --> 13:26.640
Then this is probably too many clothes.

13:30.311 --> 13:32.313
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

13:32.813 --> 13:34.023
Came here to apologize.

13:34.190 --> 13:37.276
Okay. Leonard, I really appreciate that
but I need a little time to myself.

13:38.611 --> 13:41.238
Okay, I don't get it.
You said make an effort,

13:41.405 --> 13:42.948
here I am making an effort.

13:43.240 --> 13:44.867
Hello, Amy. It's nice to see you.

13:46.327 --> 13:47.453
Nice to see you, too.

13:48.954 --> 13:50.915
And that's how you make effort
look effortless.

13:52.249 --> 13:54.543
All right. Can you please just go
and we'll talk about this tomorrow?

13:54.710 --> 13:57.087
- I don't understand what you want.
- I'm trying to figure it out.

13:57.254 --> 14:00.966
If you'd like, I could whip up
a quick Relationship Agreement.

14:02.760 --> 14:05.095
I'm at a spa.
Might as well do something relaxing.

14:06.847 --> 14:08.766
Sheldon, why don't we
give them some privacy?

14:09.225 --> 14:10.518
Very well.

14:10.809 --> 14:13.812
Hey, later, we'll check out the mini-bar.
I'll show you how Godzilla gets drunk.

14:18.275 --> 14:21.445
So, what we did was
map out the entire room

14:21.612 --> 14:23.864
to identify every squeak.

14:24.490 --> 14:27.409
Watch. It's easy once you get
the hang of it.

14:29.119 --> 14:30.120
Step.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.290
Step.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.377
Hop on the ottoman.

14:37.753 --> 14:39.797
Don't do that in socks.
I almost broke my neck.

14:41.715 --> 14:45.010
Then simply sit, spin, stand.

14:45.970 --> 14:47.763
Stretch...

14:51.350 --> 14:52.935
Maybe in looser pants.

14:55.145 --> 15:00.150
Then step, grab, tiny pivot, pull
and you're there.

15:02.194 --> 15:05.406
Easy-peasy, mac and...
You get the idea.

15:07.658 --> 15:11.161
You actually expect me to do this
while holding a baby in the dark?

15:11.328 --> 15:13.247
Hold on.

15:20.170 --> 15:21.338
I don't think she was impressed.

15:21.547 --> 15:24.008
Bigger problems.
I felt something pop.

15:28.554 --> 15:30.431
There's a cucumber in my water.

15:31.473 --> 15:32.516
Uh-huh.

15:34.518 --> 15:37.104
- Do they know it's there?
- Should I tell somebody?

15:38.606 --> 15:40.482
It's there on purpose. It's refreshing.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.615
Interesting.

15:47.781 --> 15:50.909
The world's most boring liquid
and the world's most boring vegetable,

15:51.076 --> 15:52.745
but you put them together and...
Bleh!

15:55.873 --> 15:56.874
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:57.041 --> 15:58.917
Oh, good, you're here.
Are you still fighting?

15:59.084 --> 16:00.878
If you get divorced,
do I get two Christmases?

16:02.588 --> 16:04.089
We're not getting divorced.

16:04.256 --> 16:07.176
Listen, we realized that

16:07.343 --> 16:09.887
we're facing some new challenges
as a married couple.

16:10.137 --> 16:12.473
Yeah, and there are a few things
that we need to stay on top of

16:12.640 --> 16:14.183
so we thought it would be useful...

16:15.100 --> 16:17.895
I can't believe I am about to say this.
Um...

16:18.729 --> 16:20.773
Would you please help us
make a Relationship Agreement?

16:24.276 --> 16:27.738
But one that's tailored to us, okay?
We don't need a bathroom schedule.

16:28.405 --> 16:31.950
Although, a rule about him texting me
from in there might help with the romance.

16:35.079 --> 16:36.413
What do you say?

16:36.580 --> 16:37.831
I get to write a contract?

16:37.998 --> 16:40.459
I say, let's get this party
of the first part started.

16:44.421 --> 16:45.923
Whoo!

16:47.883 --> 16:48.967
You really think that's funny?

16:49.134 --> 16:50.469
It's in our agreement, I have to laugh.

16:57.810 --> 17:01.355
If you find this draft acceptable,
then I believe your new

17:01.522 --> 17:03.982
Relationship Agreement
is ready to be signed.

17:04.650 --> 17:06.360
"Article eight, subsection B.

17:06.527 --> 17:10.364
"Leonard will restrict video gaming
in underpants to hours Penny is not home.

17:10.531 --> 17:13.033
"This includes boxers, briefs,
thongs, G-strings

17:13.200 --> 17:16.286
"or anything else that calls attention
to his pasty little thighs."

17:20.958 --> 17:22.167
Does it really need to say that?

17:22.334 --> 17:24.753
I did this for free,
let me get a little something.

17:27.381 --> 17:29.550
"Article 10, subsection C.

17:29.717 --> 17:32.928
"If questioned, Penny may not say that
everything is fine if it isn't.

17:33.679 --> 17:37.391
"Other unacceptable responses include
'It's nothing, ' 'Don't worry about it, '

17:37.558 --> 17:39.810
"and 'I said it's nothing,
don't worry about it.""

17:42.146 --> 17:43.480
Think this all looks good.

17:43.772 --> 17:44.815
Me too.

17:44.982 --> 17:46.316
Oh, well. Great, then. Here.

17:46.483 --> 17:51.155
You sign here, date here,
and Penny, if you could initial here

17:51.488 --> 17:54.658
to indicate that you're accepting
Leonard in "as is" condition.

18:02.708 --> 18:05.335
I remember signing
our first Relationship Agreement.

18:05.502 --> 18:07.296
Mmm, you seem to be forgetting
the "no nostalgia" clause.

18:07.463 --> 18:08.714
Right, right. Got it.

18:38.035 --> 18:39.036
English - SDH
