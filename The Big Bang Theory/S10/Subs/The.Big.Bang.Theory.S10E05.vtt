00:02.003 --> 00:03.254
<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

00:03.755 --> 00:07.592
Cohabitation with my girlfriend?
That's a great deal to process.

00:08.343 --> 00:09.511
Mmm. It's only for five weeks.

00:09.678 --> 00:11.471
Let me appeal to the scientist in you.

00:11.680 --> 00:13.181
Given the five-week end date,

00:13.348 --> 00:16.101
isn't it the perfect opportunity
to consider this an experiment

00:16.267 --> 00:18.019
and collect data on our compatibility?

00:18.436 --> 00:21.106
Don't try luring me in with sexy talk.

00:22.399 --> 00:24.609
Okay, <i>Star Trek</i>, the original series.

00:24.776 --> 00:27.112
The <i>Enterprise</i> was on a five-year mission
to explore new worlds.

00:27.278 --> 00:30.782
Think of this as your personal
five-week mission to do the same.

00:31.616 --> 00:34.786
Well, if you want to lure me in
with sexy talk, that's how you do it.

00:35.412 --> 00:38.623
Okay, why don't you guys stay
across the hall and we will live here?

00:40.625 --> 00:42.877
- Very well, I'm on board.
- Seriously?

00:43.044 --> 00:46.840
Yes. I accept this five-week mission to
share a living space with my girlfriend.

00:47.006 --> 00:48.550
Oh, this is so exciting.

00:48.717 --> 00:52.220
Well, now don't be surprised if
like <i>Star Trek</i>, it's canceled in three.

00:56.641 --> 00:59.227
Okay, I'm confused,
which one is Mr. Robot?

00:59.477 --> 01:00.770
I'll give you a hint,

01:00.937 --> 01:02.981
we're watching <i>Daredevil.</i>

01:04.065 --> 01:05.817
Will you two please inform Amy

01:05.984 --> 01:08.528
how much you enjoy
adhering to a strict bathroom schedule?

01:08.695 --> 01:09.696
- Can't.
- Won't.

01:09.863 --> 01:11.072
- Didn't.
- Don't.

01:12.073 --> 01:14.826
I told you, you can't regulate
every aspect of our lives.

01:14.993 --> 01:18.830
I can if you'd just
roll over and accept your fate!

01:20.081 --> 01:21.499
I'm sorry for bringing this over here.

01:21.666 --> 01:23.334
Believe me, we know
what you're going through.

01:23.501 --> 01:27.505
And I think the most helpful thing
we can tell you is, no backsies.

01:28.757 --> 01:31.634
Sheldon, I understand
that you like things a certain way

01:31.801 --> 01:33.261
and I'm willing to make some concessions,

01:33.428 --> 01:35.430
but you have to be open to compromise.

01:35.680 --> 01:37.474
- She's right, that's reasonable.
- Oh!

01:37.682 --> 01:39.184
Look who's in favor of compromise,

01:39.350 --> 01:42.228
the woman who married Leonard Hofstadter.

01:42.812 --> 01:46.733
Hey, she didn't compromise,
she settled, there's a difference.

01:47.901 --> 01:50.528
Yeah. You tell 'em, babe.

02:16.888 --> 02:18.556
What time do you and Bernadette head out?

02:18.723 --> 02:21.851
Well, as soon as I get home.
We're hoping to make it before dark.

02:22.018 --> 02:23.520
I've never been to Palm Springs.

02:23.686 --> 02:24.938
You should go, it's terrific.

02:25.104 --> 02:29.400
I really thrive anywhere the women
and the temperature are over 90.

02:31.444 --> 02:32.737
I don't know.

02:32.904 --> 02:36.991
If I want to watch old people sweat
I can just FaceTime my family in India.

02:38.827 --> 02:41.120
It's nice you and Bernadette
are getting away.

02:41.329 --> 02:45.083
Well, she wants us to spend more time
together before the baby comes.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.585
So then, what are you doing
here buying comic books?

02:47.794 --> 02:50.088
Well, he wants us to
spend more time together

02:50.255 --> 02:51.756
before the baby comes.

02:54.592 --> 02:56.719
When you live with someone
there's gonna be conflict.

02:56.886 --> 02:59.180
You just have to keep communicating.

02:59.347 --> 03:00.890
Well, I'm open to that.

03:01.766 --> 03:04.269
Okay, well, for starters,

03:04.435 --> 03:07.522
there's nothing wrong with keeping
our toothbrushes in the same holder.

03:09.357 --> 03:11.150
Sheldon, what do you say to that?

03:11.442 --> 03:12.819
I think we should see other people.

03:16.239 --> 03:17.282
What?

03:17.448 --> 03:20.118
Well, as a male,
I have an evolutionary drive

03:20.285 --> 03:21.953
to perpetuate my DNA.

03:22.120 --> 03:23.955
And restricting myself
to a single partner,

03:24.163 --> 03:25.290
it's against my nature.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.877
We sleep together once a year!

03:29.043 --> 03:31.337
You want other partners?

03:32.088 --> 03:34.465
Don't blame me, blame your pal biology,

03:34.632 --> 03:36.676
he's the pervert pulling the strings here.

03:38.219 --> 03:40.471
You wanna see other people?
Go see other people!

03:40.638 --> 03:43.433
I hope one of those people is a monkey
because this is bananas.

03:45.268 --> 03:46.311
Hey, you can make jokes,

03:46.477 --> 03:48.438
but if this keeps up
he's gonna move back in here.

03:48.605 --> 03:50.064
Right, well, let's at least
get them apart for a while

03:50.231 --> 03:51.566
so they can cool down.

03:51.733 --> 03:53.651
Good. Then before we reintroduce them

03:53.818 --> 03:55.111
we'll give him one of her sweaters

03:55.278 --> 03:57.196
so he can get used to her scent again.

03:58.823 --> 04:00.533
Wait, so it's okay for you to joke around?

04:00.700 --> 04:02.660
Well, no, that's actually
what we did with him

04:02.827 --> 04:04.454
when Howard came back from space.

04:07.373 --> 04:09.542
Honey, how you feeling?

04:13.212 --> 04:15.673
The book says at this
stage of the pregnancy

04:15.840 --> 04:17.884
morning sickness should be going away.

04:22.513 --> 04:24.641
So, that's good news, right?

04:25.266 --> 04:28.227
<i>The only thing I hate more
than you right now is that book!</i>

04:33.483 --> 04:35.401
<i>There she is!</i>

04:37.362 --> 04:41.032
Who's ready for a hot,
three-hour car ride to the desert?

04:42.742 --> 04:45.370
Next vomit is going to be in your lap.

04:47.455 --> 04:50.041
I'm sorry. We don't have to go.

04:50.708 --> 04:54.253
But it's our last chance to take
a vacation that's just the two of us.

04:55.421 --> 04:56.631
How about we stay here?

04:57.090 --> 04:58.800
We don't even have to tell anyone,

04:58.967 --> 05:01.552
it'll be like a secret vacation at home.

05:03.054 --> 05:04.722
Keeping secrets from our friends,

05:04.889 --> 05:06.057
it does sound kind of fun.

05:06.224 --> 05:07.517
Does it sound

05:08.059 --> 05:09.227
sexy?

05:15.024 --> 05:17.568
You just heard me throwing up.

05:18.236 --> 05:19.737
You bet I did.

05:26.744 --> 05:28.371
You're so weird.

05:30.748 --> 05:32.083
You know what's weird?

05:36.504 --> 05:38.297
How turned on you are right now.

05:41.551 --> 05:44.429
You know, people are quick to accuse me
of being difficult to live with,

05:44.595 --> 05:47.098
but the truth is,
Amy is just as challenging.

05:48.391 --> 05:50.601
- Just as challenging.
- Yes.

05:51.561 --> 05:52.812
As you?

05:53.980 --> 05:55.273
Yes.

05:56.607 --> 05:58.484
- Just as challenging as you?
- Yeah...

06:00.111 --> 06:03.072
When we're sleeping she breathes on me.

06:03.239 --> 06:04.282
Well, one night it got so bad

06:04.449 --> 06:07.160
I almost grabbed Toto
and headed for the storm cellar.

06:07.994 --> 06:10.413
Well, Leonard breathes on me, too.
It's not a big deal.

06:10.580 --> 06:13.041
She's always complaining
about people at work.

06:13.207 --> 06:14.333
Well, so does Leonard.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.169
It's kind of annoying,
but it's not the end of the world.

06:16.502 --> 06:18.046
Do you know that
when I get out of the shower,

06:18.212 --> 06:21.466
she eyes me up and down
like I'm a piece of meat?

06:21.632 --> 06:23.092
You know, so does Leonard!

06:23.259 --> 06:24.469
Can't I just get ready in the morning

06:24.635 --> 06:27.096
- without him giving me his goofy thumbs-up?
- "Hey!"

06:29.682 --> 06:32.310
I know, sometimes I would just like
to be appreciated for my mind.

06:32.477 --> 06:34.395
Agreed! Thank you!

06:39.442 --> 06:40.860
That feels great.

06:41.486 --> 06:43.654
Well, pulling a quarter out of your ear

06:43.821 --> 06:46.157
isn't the only magic these hands can do.

06:48.326 --> 06:51.579
In fact, what, what's
this between your toes?

06:53.289 --> 06:56.667
Can you please stop making money
come out of me for two minutes?

07:03.841 --> 07:06.135
- Was that the front door?
- It sounded like it.

07:06.302 --> 07:09.013
Oh, my God, someone's in the house.

07:09.263 --> 07:11.099
Lock the door, lock the door!

07:13.601 --> 07:15.019
We should call the police.

07:15.520 --> 07:16.687
I left my phone downstairs!

07:17.188 --> 07:18.439
Damn, so did I.

07:18.606 --> 07:19.690
Wait, I have my iPad!

07:19.857 --> 07:21.901
What are we gonna do, email 911?

07:23.402 --> 07:24.529
That's not helpful!

07:24.695 --> 07:26.697
You know I rely on humor
in times of stress!

07:26.948 --> 07:29.283
Let me know when you start,
because that wasn't funny!

07:33.663 --> 07:35.248
Is that the hot tub?

07:37.083 --> 07:38.793
Who would use our hot tub?

07:40.419 --> 07:41.712
Well, the answer is both

07:41.879 --> 07:44.215
more and less disturbing than you think.

07:45.383 --> 07:46.968
- Who is it?
- Stuart.

07:51.180 --> 07:53.391
He heard me talking about us going away.

07:53.558 --> 07:56.519
I guess he decided to invite himself over.

07:57.019 --> 07:58.354
Should we say something to him?

07:58.896 --> 08:00.815
Maybe. Wait, how about,

08:00.982 --> 08:03.901
"Hey, you look like
a boiled chicken breast!"

08:06.445 --> 08:08.990
I meant like, "What are you doing here?"

08:09.157 --> 08:11.909
No, that's not gonna hurt his feelings.

08:14.412 --> 08:15.997
Why is nothing easy with him?

08:16.205 --> 08:19.083
Look, here's the thing you need
to understand about Sheldon,

08:20.084 --> 08:21.419
he's the worst.

08:23.421 --> 08:25.381
I prefer to think of it
as high-maintenance.

08:25.548 --> 08:27.300
I prefer to think of myself as 5'10",

08:27.466 --> 08:29.802
but I still need to get
all my pants hemmed.

08:31.512 --> 08:33.514
Guess I should have known
what I was getting myself into.

08:33.931 --> 08:36.976
Don't beat yourself up,
you've never lived with anyone before.

08:37.143 --> 08:38.227
That's true.

08:38.394 --> 08:41.272
And you're starting out
with Sheldon Cooper.

08:41.439 --> 08:43.941
I mean, that's like getting your
first pet and having it be,

08:44.108 --> 08:45.693
I don't know. What...

08:46.110 --> 08:48.905
What's a kind of pet that ruins your life?

08:50.114 --> 08:51.490
You're not making me feel better.

08:51.991 --> 08:54.410
Look, even when Penny
and I started living together

08:54.577 --> 08:56.621
there was a learning curve,

08:56.787 --> 08:58.581
but, I promise you it does get easier.

08:58.956 --> 09:00.625
He put a sign up
in the bathroom that says,

09:00.791 --> 09:03.961
"Number of days without
Amy's hair on the soap."

09:06.547 --> 09:09.675
Yeah, my record was six.

09:13.054 --> 09:16.807
Is it me, or is there something fun
about watching him just float there?

09:19.393 --> 09:21.771
Maybe this is why people get fish tanks.

09:24.148 --> 09:25.983
Who just turned the porch lights on?

09:26.234 --> 09:27.693
Is someone else here?

09:31.072 --> 09:32.907
They must've left the tub on,

09:33.491 --> 09:34.909
good thing I stopped by.

09:49.632 --> 09:50.633
Ah...

09:55.513 --> 09:56.889
Oh, my God!

10:04.438 --> 10:06.399
What are you doing here?

10:07.441 --> 10:09.110
What are you doing here?

10:10.486 --> 10:12.488
Maybe Howard and Bernadette
said I could be here?

10:12.697 --> 10:13.948
Did they?

10:14.991 --> 10:17.034
Just answer the question,
what are you doing here?

10:19.537 --> 10:20.955
I had nothing else to do tonight.

10:21.706 --> 10:22.873
Well, the last couple of months,

10:23.124 --> 10:24.792
I come here when I know they're not home.

10:25.042 --> 10:27.295
- What?
- They heard me in the bushes once,

10:27.461 --> 10:29.463
but they thought it was a raccoon.

10:31.132 --> 10:33.217
I told you raccoons don't say, "Uh-oh."

10:36.679 --> 10:39.015
You know, one night Leonard's
nose whistled so loud,

10:39.223 --> 10:41.559
I swear it was like
sleeping on a train track.

10:42.560 --> 10:44.770
Have you noticed it's always an A-flat?

10:45.062 --> 10:46.772
Is it?

10:46.939 --> 10:49.400
Ugh! It's like his sinuses
are right here in the car.

10:50.985 --> 10:52.945
If we're just gonna
drive around aimlessly,

10:53.112 --> 10:54.989
the least you could do
is take me for ice cream.

10:55.197 --> 10:56.532
Yeah, I'll take you for ice cream.

10:56.699 --> 10:59.702
Well, see?
Now why can't Amy be that subservient?

10:59.869 --> 11:02.788
She has coitus one time,
suddenly she's Gloria Steinem.

11:04.623 --> 11:06.417
Anyway, I suppose an ice cream parlor

11:06.584 --> 11:08.127
will be a good place to meet other women.

11:08.294 --> 11:11.714
Oh, please, you're barely interested in
a physical relationship with one person.

11:11.881 --> 11:15.092
Why would you want to
confuse and disappoint others?

11:15.259 --> 11:17.136
Being with Amy has awoken

11:17.303 --> 11:19.263
the sexual creature within.

11:19.847 --> 11:22.266
Well, when I see a pretty gal
walking down the street

11:22.433 --> 11:25.561
I think, "Hubba, hubba"
like any other guy.

11:26.270 --> 11:28.606
You kiss your mother with that mouth?

11:28.773 --> 11:29.815
'Cause it's fine.

11:33.778 --> 11:35.988
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

11:38.407 --> 11:39.950
Shall we toast?

11:40.951 --> 11:42.620
To Howard and Bernadette,

11:42.995 --> 11:45.331
and the house key
they never asked me to return.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.043
You said you got it back!

11:49.794 --> 11:52.296
Well, clearly I lied.

11:54.340 --> 11:55.466
So, how's your apartment?

11:55.633 --> 11:57.385
Not great, the electricity's out.

11:58.094 --> 11:59.136
So, why don't you get it fixed?

11:59.303 --> 12:02.640
I called and they're all like,
"Pay your bill!"

12:04.517 --> 12:06.852
If you need somewhere to crash,
there's always my place.

12:07.103 --> 12:09.814
No. I don't wanna be an inconvenience,

12:09.980 --> 12:11.899
you've got all your lady friends and...

12:12.149 --> 12:14.527
Actually I'm single now.

12:14.944 --> 12:16.445
What? When did that happen?

12:16.654 --> 12:18.489
It's okay, it's by choice.

12:18.656 --> 12:21.242
Well, their choice and it's not okay.

12:23.077 --> 12:24.328
Sorry. I didn't know.

12:24.995 --> 12:26.080
Nobody does,

12:26.247 --> 12:27.957
I was embarrassed,
so I didn't say anything.

12:28.999 --> 12:31.836
Why wouldn't he tell us?
Are we bad friends?

12:32.253 --> 12:34.338
He's in our hot tub drinking our wine.

12:35.089 --> 12:37.341
Yeah, he deserves to be alone.

12:38.968 --> 12:41.262
So, you're back out on
the dating scene now?

12:41.804 --> 12:43.180
Yeah, yeah, a little.

12:43.347 --> 12:45.182
Well, that must be fun. How's that going?

12:45.391 --> 12:47.601
I'm in a hot tub with you, so, pretty bad.

12:51.188 --> 12:53.691
Maybe I should just give in to
his stupid bathroom schedule.

12:53.858 --> 12:55.109
No, don't do that.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.194
- But you did!
- Exactly!

12:57.361 --> 12:59.280
Learn from my mistakes.

13:00.906 --> 13:02.741
No matter where I am, at 7:18 a.m.,

13:02.950 --> 13:05.202
there better be a toilet nearby.

13:08.873 --> 13:10.583
It's just so much easier
to give him what he wants.

13:10.749 --> 13:12.042
Well, true.

13:12.293 --> 13:14.503
But, think of how much
you've accomplished.

13:14.712 --> 13:16.922
Who got him to stop
purelling his pocket change?

13:18.382 --> 13:19.383
Me.

13:19.592 --> 13:22.720
And who got him to put things other
than gloves in the glove compartment?

13:24.221 --> 13:26.348
Me, it was mittens.

13:28.058 --> 13:29.768
And who got him to try a turkey dog?

13:30.019 --> 13:33.647
That was actually Koothrappali,
but I did let him spit it out in my hand.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.901
How can you stop now?

13:37.067 --> 13:40.905
That's like walking out of <i>Pinocchio</i>
right before he becomes a real boy.

13:42.323 --> 13:44.408
You know, you're right,
I'm in this relationship, too.

13:44.575 --> 13:45.784
I need to stand up for myself.

13:45.951 --> 13:47.036
Of course you do.

13:47.244 --> 13:48.996
And if he doesn't like it
he can move back here.

13:49.705 --> 13:52.082
He can try,
he'd just need a good locksmith.

13:56.212 --> 13:58.339
Well, who are you gonna hit on?

13:59.006 --> 14:01.926
Girl in front of us got strawberry,
that's your favorite.

14:03.093 --> 14:05.221
No, no, if we both like it,

14:05.429 --> 14:07.848
I'll spend the rest of my life
opening the freezer and going,

14:08.015 --> 14:09.934
"Oh. No strawberry."

14:11.644 --> 14:12.811
What about the girl behind the counter?

14:14.021 --> 14:15.898
Well, she spends her whole day scooping,

14:16.065 --> 14:18.192
one arm's probably bigger than the other.

14:19.944 --> 14:22.363
Is it possible you might not
actually want to meet someone?

14:24.615 --> 14:26.700
You are truly wise.

14:27.493 --> 14:28.494
Thank you.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.788
I'd say wise beyond your years
but you're getting up there.

14:30.955 --> 14:32.331
All right.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.626
Come on, what is really going on with you?

14:38.212 --> 14:41.632
Penny, I am going to tell you a story
that I've never told anyone.

14:42.132 --> 14:43.175
All right.

14:44.426 --> 14:48.180
I was 13 years old
and on spring break from college.

14:53.352 --> 14:54.478
Not relating, go on.

14:55.729 --> 14:58.816
I came home early because
they ran out of math to teach me.

14:58.983 --> 15:00.901
Now I'm with you. Right.

15:01.527 --> 15:03.153
My mother was at Bible study.

15:03.320 --> 15:05.489
I walked in the house
expecting to find it empty

15:05.656 --> 15:08.993
and I heard a sound
coming from my parents' bedroom.

15:09.868 --> 15:12.830
When I opened the door, I saw my father

15:12.997 --> 15:14.665
having relations with another woman.

15:16.041 --> 15:17.835
- Oh, my... That's awful.
- I know.

15:18.419 --> 15:21.422
It's also why I never open
a door without knocking three times.

15:22.673 --> 15:24.008
The first one's traditional

15:24.174 --> 15:26.802
but two and three are for
people to get their pants on.

15:28.596 --> 15:30.055
Well, what happened with your dad?

15:30.889 --> 15:34.018
We locked eyes, I ran to my room

15:34.560 --> 15:35.853
and we never, ever spoke of it.

15:36.687 --> 15:37.771
You poor thing.

15:38.188 --> 15:40.357
Since Amy and I have been living together

15:40.524 --> 15:42.860
we've been bickering
like my parents used to.

15:43.694 --> 15:46.196
And you're afraid you're gonna
do something like your dad did?

15:46.447 --> 15:49.241
Yes. I need to prepare her now

15:49.408 --> 15:51.910
to save her from pain down the road.

15:52.077 --> 15:54.997
Down the road? Sheldon, she wanted
to share a toothbrush holder with you

15:55.164 --> 15:58.208
and now you're at an ice cream parlor
trying to pick up women!

16:00.502 --> 16:03.881
Well, anything can sound silly
when you put it in that tone.

16:04.048 --> 16:06.383
Honey, instead of worrying about
pain you may cause in the future,

16:06.550 --> 16:09.386
how about trying to fix the pain
you're causing her right now?

16:11.597 --> 16:13.474
I'm sure you're right.

16:14.558 --> 16:16.810
And I suppose I should
apologize to you, as well.

16:17.811 --> 16:20.022
- Okay.
- That must have hurt,

16:20.189 --> 16:24.109
watching me look for other women
without ever even considering you.

16:28.822 --> 16:30.699
Please understand that

16:30.908 --> 16:34.078
I think of you as more of a nanny.

16:36.413 --> 16:40.000
Just finish your ice cream
so I can get you home to bed.

16:44.755 --> 16:48.634
I wonder if this is what it feels like
to be Bernadette's baby.

16:50.719 --> 16:53.430
I don't know, Bernadette's baby
doesn't have a Jacuzzi jet

16:53.597 --> 16:55.766
hitting just the right spot.

16:58.686 --> 17:01.855
Those jets are for
my secret spot, not his.

17:03.148 --> 17:04.942
What do you do in there?

17:05.109 --> 17:08.487
It's called relaxing
and that's all you need to know.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.282
Well,

17:12.574 --> 17:15.119
it's getting late,
maybe we should head home.

17:15.953 --> 17:17.788
Yeah, probably right.

17:20.624 --> 17:22.918
- You coming?
- Yeah, just give me a minute.

17:23.585 --> 17:24.628
Why?

17:24.878 --> 17:27.715
Well, you know how you're
wearing a bathing suit?

17:29.341 --> 17:30.467
Yeah?

17:30.676 --> 17:32.636
I kind of went the other way.

17:33.846 --> 17:36.348
You jackasses just bought
yourselves a hot tub!

17:47.568 --> 17:50.320
- What do you think?
- It's a nice enough spot.

17:50.487 --> 17:52.072
You know, if I'm going to start
standing up for myself,

17:52.239 --> 17:53.574
- this is exactly the kind...
- Hi.

17:53.741 --> 17:55.492
Oh, hi. Hi.

17:58.829 --> 18:00.456
- Hello.
- How you guys doing?

18:00.664 --> 18:02.082
We're doing good.
I think Sheldon has something

18:02.249 --> 18:03.500
he would like to say to Amy.

18:08.338 --> 18:12.176
I wanted to apologize
for my behavior today. It...

18:20.851 --> 18:22.770
It was unnecessary.

18:23.187 --> 18:24.646
This is warm.

18:28.358 --> 18:29.610
Oh, and also,

18:29.777 --> 18:32.863
I am willing to forego
the bathroom schedule.

18:34.448 --> 18:37.701
- Really?
- Why does she get that? We never got that!

18:38.535 --> 18:41.038
- Do you want him back?
- I'm very happy for you.

18:42.956 --> 18:44.708
Amy, you should know,

18:44.917 --> 18:47.127
I was never really interested
in seeing other women.

18:47.920 --> 18:51.298
And to prove how serious I am about us,

18:51.465 --> 18:54.384
I'm willing to take our relationship
to the next level.

18:56.595 --> 18:57.930
Amy Farrah Fowler,

18:58.639 --> 19:01.934
will you share this
toothbrush holder with me?

19:04.353 --> 19:05.938
I would love to.

19:12.027 --> 19:14.988
Did we really need to be here for this?

19:16.406 --> 19:18.951
Call me crazy but I found it moving.

19:49.857 --> 19:50.858
English - SDH
