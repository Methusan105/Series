WEBVTT

00:03.630 --> 00:05.965
Thank you very much, thanks. I was just...

00:06.132 --> 00:08.051
That is unbelievable,
good for Bert.

00:08.259 --> 00:10.470
Damn, the MacArthur Genius Grant.

00:10.762 --> 00:12.263
Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.

00:12.514 --> 00:14.391
Everything is stupid and I wanna go home.

00:16.476 --> 00:19.229
That's Sheldon's way of saying
he's proud of Bert, too.

00:20.939 --> 00:22.941
You know, it's not even called
the "Genius Grant,"

00:23.108 --> 00:24.609
it's the MacArthur Fellowship.

00:24.776 --> 00:27.529
Just like it's not Frankenstein,
it's "Frankenstein's Monster."

00:27.696 --> 00:30.281
Which brings us back to
that hulking simpleton over there.

00:32.951 --> 00:35.537
And if anyone's a genius, it's me
for the way I brought that full circle!

00:37.622 --> 00:40.375
- How much money did he win? Wow!
- Over half a million dollars.

00:40.542 --> 00:42.127
And he doesn't have to use it
for research,

00:42.293 --> 00:43.962
- he can do whatever he wants with it.
- Oh, good.

00:44.170 --> 00:46.005
Maybe he can build a nicer bridge
to live under.

00:48.633 --> 00:50.552
- Here he comes.
- Right. Be polite.

00:50.719 --> 00:52.554
- I know how to behave.
- Do you?

00:53.972 --> 00:56.558
- Hey, congratulations, Bert.
- Yeah, good for you.

00:56.808 --> 00:59.269
Thanks. I was as surprised as anybody.

00:59.436 --> 01:01.646
When they called and told me I won,
I didn't believe them.

01:01.938 --> 01:06.151
And then they said, "No, you really won,"
and then I said, "Cool."

01:07.819 --> 01:11.573
Someone call George R. R. Martin,
this guy knows how to finish a story.

01:12.824 --> 01:14.617
Gotten pretty good at telling it.

01:16.202 --> 01:17.454
Well, see ya.

01:18.830 --> 01:22.250
Some "genius," I zinged him with sarcasm
and he didn't even notice.

01:23.501 --> 01:27.130
I know, and it was the greatest
sarcastic quip I've ever heard.

01:27.839 --> 01:29.174
Well, aren't you a peach.

01:57.994 --> 02:00.371
Who leaves their bike in the hallway?

02:00.538 --> 02:02.707
You know, if I knew how to ride one
I'd steal it.

02:04.542 --> 02:07.712
Ignore him, he's just cranky
because Bert from the geology lab

02:07.879 --> 02:08.880
won a big grant.

02:09.047 --> 02:12.342
Oh, I heard him interviewed on the radio!
You know, when they told him he won,

02:12.592 --> 02:15.887
he didn't believe it, but then
he did believe it. It was so funny.

02:17.806 --> 02:19.641
Who listens to the radio anymore?

02:21.851 --> 02:23.686
Bert is studying
the way microbes in rocks

02:23.853 --> 02:25.522
can survive
in extreme environmental conditions.

02:25.688 --> 02:28.650
Hmm, they say it could be a potential
indicator of life on other planets.

02:28.900 --> 02:32.737
No, I have met Bert, isn't he an indicator
of life on other planets?

02:34.948 --> 02:36.699
You used to make
those jokes about me.

02:38.535 --> 02:40.370
Now everything is "Bert, Bert, Bert."

02:42.163 --> 02:45.083
You know, Sheldon, maybe if you took
the time to read Bert's research,

02:45.250 --> 02:47.085
you'd be less bitter about him winning.

02:47.252 --> 02:50.255
You want me to read a geology paper?

02:50.588 --> 02:53.174
Honestly, I just want you to be quiet,
but I'm all out of taffy.

02:58.054 --> 03:00.640
You busy? There's somebody out here
who wants to meet you.

03:01.140 --> 03:04.269
- Who is it?
- Say hello to everybody's little friend,

03:04.435 --> 03:07.021
remote-control Stephen Hawking!

03:11.776 --> 03:15.446
- Where did you get that?
- I found him in an old box.

03:15.780 --> 03:17.198
Why would you buy it?

03:18.449 --> 03:20.368
I didn't buy it, I made it.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.998
Last question. What is wrong with you?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.794
- What's the big deal?
- Howie, it's in poor taste.

03:29.961 --> 03:32.589
No, it's not.
Check it out, he says fun stuff.

03:33.423 --> 03:36.551
<i>Hey, good lookin', want to go for a spin?</i>

03:43.474 --> 03:45.560
His eyes also light up in the dark.

03:52.025 --> 03:54.319
It's always fun
watching him read someone else's work.

04:10.168 --> 04:12.712
It's like scrolling through the emojis
on my phone.

04:16.007 --> 04:17.300
Why?

04:18.801 --> 04:20.595
Why?

04:23.014 --> 04:24.182
Oh, that's why.

04:25.850 --> 04:27.101
Sounds like the night we had coitus.

04:30.104 --> 04:32.190
I hope you're happy making me read this.

04:32.482 --> 04:34.859
Bert's work is remarkable
and I'm more upset than ever.

04:35.234 --> 04:36.694
This is worse than
when I had to admit that

04:36.861 --> 04:38.738
Cedric the Entertainer's
actually entertaining.

04:40.615 --> 04:44.077
Sheldon, it's foolish to be angry
that Bert's work has merit.

04:44.285 --> 04:46.162
Yeah, well, I am angry!

04:46.371 --> 04:48.831
And you telling me not to be angry
makes me angry!

04:48.998 --> 04:51.250
And do you know how hearing myself
say the word "angry" over and over

04:51.417 --> 04:52.835
- makes me feel?
- Ooh! Angry?

04:53.002 --> 04:54.712
- What are you doing?
- I'm...

04:55.630 --> 04:57.966
I knew the answer,
I got excited.

04:59.550 --> 05:02.178
Hey, buddy, why don't we go for a walk
so you can calm down?

05:02.470 --> 05:06.224
That's a good idea.
I guess, everyone's having them now.

05:08.309 --> 05:09.686
Hey, I'm trying to help you.

05:09.936 --> 05:12.939
Fine, you can walk ahead of me
and scare off the pigeons.

05:16.150 --> 05:19.237
You just wave your arms a little
and they fly away, it's not...

05:22.448 --> 05:25.702
Okay, Raj, I'm gonna show you something.

05:25.868 --> 05:28.913
Now, one of us thinks it's offensive,

05:29.247 --> 05:32.667
the other thinks it's hilarious
and a great idea.

05:34.252 --> 05:37.588
But I'm not going to tell you
who likes it.

05:46.305 --> 05:47.640
This is tough.

05:49.100 --> 05:52.603
But, I'm going to say it's the guy
who shows me YouTube videos

05:52.854 --> 05:54.439
of people getting hit in the nuts.

05:57.525 --> 05:58.526
You're crazy.

05:58.693 --> 06:02.113
I've worked with Hawking, he's got a great
sense of humor and I think he'd like it.

06:02.572 --> 06:05.116
Okay, call him and show him. I dare you.

06:05.950 --> 06:07.744
I have no problem calling him.

06:08.036 --> 06:10.288
- Fine, then do it.
- Fine, I will.

06:13.249 --> 06:15.960
While you're bothering
the world's most famous scientist,

06:16.169 --> 06:19.130
be sure to show him how funny he looks
getting stuck under our dishwasher.

06:21.924 --> 06:23.176
What's this button do?

06:23.426 --> 06:25.928
<i>Gentlemen, start your wheelchairs.</i>

06:30.808 --> 06:32.602
You laughed
when that guy got hit in the nuts.

06:35.521 --> 06:37.273
I laughed because the guy was Leonard.

06:42.153 --> 06:45.156
- I admire you, Leonard.
- Really? Why?

06:46.032 --> 06:50.286
You're happy with who you are.
You don't get jealous of other people.

06:50.870 --> 06:53.664
Instead of being weighed down by ambition,

06:53.873 --> 06:56.751
you just float along
like a dead body in a river.

07:00.338 --> 07:02.256
I couldn't just take the compliment,
I had to ask why.

07:05.927 --> 07:08.221
You know,
I do understand what you're feeling.

07:08.888 --> 07:12.058
My brother and sister's accomplishments
have always been held over my head.

07:13.392 --> 07:14.477
How did you deal with it?

07:15.103 --> 07:18.648
I wet the bed until college,
but I don't think that's a quality fix.

07:22.110 --> 07:24.654
I can't believe
I was surpassed by a geologist!

07:25.238 --> 07:28.032
I mean, rocks!

07:28.658 --> 07:30.535
He studies rocks!

07:30.952 --> 07:33.412
If rock is so great,
how come paper beats it?

07:36.958 --> 07:39.627
Leonard, I'm having a primal urge
to throw this rock.

07:40.211 --> 07:45.550
Do it! Visualize it as your anger
and toss it out of your life.

07:47.093 --> 07:48.719
Perhaps, I will.

07:52.682 --> 07:57.228
This rock encapsulates
all my negative emotions.

07:58.229 --> 08:00.606
I will cast you far away.

08:01.607 --> 08:03.734
Feel free to take out a pigeon
while you're at it.

08:05.528 --> 08:07.071
Let it fly.

08:09.907 --> 08:12.243
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

08:15.705 --> 08:16.831
What happened?

08:17.123 --> 08:20.751
I tried to let go of anger
and threw a rock into my foot!

08:22.587 --> 08:25.756
Then he got more angry and kicked the rock
with his other foot.

08:26.424 --> 08:28.885
- And what happened to you?
- Oh, I laughed so hard

08:29.051 --> 08:30.845
I burst a blood vessel in my nose,
it's fine.

08:38.352 --> 08:41.272
You know, it's one thing to be envious,
but now you're injuring yourself?

08:41.814 --> 08:44.442
- It has to stop.
- Although, if you're gonna do it again,

08:44.609 --> 08:46.944
please let me know
so I can get it on video.

08:48.446 --> 08:51.741
You know, Sheldon,
instead of fixating on what Bert has,

08:51.908 --> 08:56.120
you should appreciate all of the good
things in your life. You've got love,

08:56.287 --> 08:59.123
you're in good health,
you've got a roof over your head...

08:59.290 --> 09:03.753
Yeah, but you've got all those things,
and no one's lining up to be you.

09:06.505 --> 09:08.799
Anybody else wanna try?
I'm gonna go make some more tea

09:08.966 --> 09:10.218
and question my life choices.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.304
You're up.

09:14.513 --> 09:17.308
This is getting old fast, Dolores,
knock it off!

09:18.809 --> 09:21.646
Do you really think calling me
names is helpful?

09:21.812 --> 09:24.148
I do! Your life is fine, you big baby!

09:25.149 --> 09:27.318
- Maybe you're right.
- Really?

09:29.111 --> 09:31.822
If it helps, I'm questioning
your life choices, too.

09:33.032 --> 09:35.743
Thank you, Penny. You know, I just need to
keep reminding myself

09:35.952 --> 09:39.080
- that Bert's success is not my failure.
- There you go!

09:39.247 --> 09:42.083
And that men of his large stature
are more susceptible to a wide array

09:42.250 --> 09:43.960
of life-threatening diseases.

09:45.169 --> 09:46.671
There you go.

09:53.344 --> 09:55.930
- What's up?
- I'm conducting a quick survey.

09:56.138 --> 10:03.062
Do you think this respectful and loving
tribute to a great man is in poor taste?

10:12.029 --> 10:13.030
Yep.

10:15.950 --> 10:19.578
- Do you think this is in poor taste?
- Does it spin around and do tricks?

10:19.829 --> 10:22.039
- Yeah!
- Then, yeah.

10:23.207 --> 10:26.877
- What do you think?
- That is hilarious!

10:28.587 --> 10:31.632
Give me the remote control, I wanna drive
him into the girls' restroom.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.219
All right, we're done, it's offensive.

10:46.230 --> 10:49.483
- Top of the afternoon, gentlemen.
- You're in a good mood.

10:49.650 --> 10:53.279
Oh, it's a new day, I have a new outlook.
You know, I realized

10:53.446 --> 10:58.409
I don't need to worry about other people,
I just need to think more about myself.

11:01.996 --> 11:04.999
Oh, how will we ever get used
to the new you?

11:06.459 --> 11:08.753
Well, I'm glad to see you moving forward.

11:08.919 --> 11:13.466
Bert did quality research, and he deserves
whatever accolades he receives.

11:14.592 --> 11:17.720
Wait, what is going on...
Did you upgrade his software last night?

11:19.096 --> 11:20.765
I think he might be learning on his own.

11:21.390 --> 11:23.267
Then the robot uprising has begun.

11:25.102 --> 11:28.773
Excuse me, I need to pay Bert
a proper congratulations.

11:32.777 --> 11:35.946
He doesn't just look like C-3PO,
now he walks like him.

11:38.324 --> 11:41.786
Bert, I wanted to let you know
that I read your research

11:42.119 --> 11:44.622
and your award is well-deserved.

11:45.247 --> 11:50.086
Thanks. I've been hearing that a lot.
Ever since I won, people think I'm great.

11:52.129 --> 11:55.633
Well, just this once you can count me
as people, too.

11:58.886 --> 12:01.347
You know, as a MacArthur Grant winner,

12:01.514 --> 12:03.766
I'm allowed to nominate someone
for next year.

12:03.933 --> 12:07.561
Really? I didn't know that.

12:07.812 --> 12:11.315
So I was thinking, you know,
engineers don't get a lot of respect.

12:11.482 --> 12:14.402
Is your friend, Howard,
working on anything cool?

12:17.196 --> 12:21.992
You know, I'm not sure. No, you'd have to
ask him. Excuse me.

12:33.963 --> 12:37.550
<i>Leonard, I hurt myself again!</i>

12:39.260 --> 12:42.304
Excuse me, I have to go
take some pictures.

12:44.932 --> 12:47.226
I can't believe you head-butted
a water fountain.

12:49.645 --> 12:52.731
No, I went to punch the water fountain,

12:52.898 --> 12:55.192
slipped in water
in front of the water fountain

12:55.359 --> 12:58.028
and hit my head on the water fountain.

12:58.863 --> 13:00.739
I can't imagine you being violent.

13:00.906 --> 13:03.075
It's not hard,
just picture The Three Stooges

13:03.242 --> 13:04.910
and then take away two stooges.

13:06.662 --> 13:11.250
I'm so disappointed in myself,
jealousy is completely illogical.

13:11.417 --> 13:14.545
It's a human emotion, Sheldon,
everyone gets jealous.

13:14.753 --> 13:17.047
I'm jealous of Leonard and Penny,
and Howard and Bernadette

13:17.256 --> 13:20.468
- for being in such happy relationships.
- What about me and Sheldon?

13:23.846 --> 13:24.847
Sure.

13:28.851 --> 13:31.770
I've always been jealous of how much money
Raj's family has.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.522
Thank you for saying that.

13:33.689 --> 13:36.859
Next to buying things, that is
the best part about having money.

13:37.985 --> 13:41.405
Well, ever since I met Penny,
I've been envious of her looks.

13:41.572 --> 13:43.073
Aw, thank you.

13:43.365 --> 13:44.950
That's why I was so happy
when you cut your hair off.

13:45.117 --> 13:46.368
What?

13:46.577 --> 13:48.746
You know what I mean. You were still hot,

13:48.996 --> 13:51.665
but more like a "why'd that hot girl
cut off all her hair" hot.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.419
Well, you liked my hair short, right?

13:55.628 --> 13:57.880
Yes, I loved it!

13:58.047 --> 14:00.883
Love you, love the hair,
would love to change the subject.

14:03.135 --> 14:05.137
Seriously, none of you liked it?

14:06.889 --> 14:09.433
I thought it was brave,
does that count as liking it?

14:11.936 --> 14:14.730
You know, how come nobody's talking about
Howard's dopey haircut?

14:18.943 --> 14:21.237
- I think he looks cute.
- I think you're cute.

14:21.403 --> 14:24.156
- I think you're both cute.
- I think I hate all of you nerds.

14:31.372 --> 14:34.083
- Sorry, I'm moving slowly.
- I don't mind.

14:34.625 --> 14:35.918
If you pull a butterscotch
out of your pocket,

14:36.085 --> 14:37.920
it'll be like I'm walking with my grandma.

14:41.840 --> 14:42.841
Oh, no.

14:47.638 --> 14:49.848
A plaque?

14:50.099 --> 14:52.518
Nobody wants to see this!

14:53.477 --> 14:57.523
Well. Change "plaque" to "mixed-race
couple" and you are my grandma.

14:57.982 --> 14:59.692
I can't take this anymore.

15:01.443 --> 15:04.697
Bert. Bert. Bert.

15:05.239 --> 15:07.366
<i>- Come in.</i>
- All right, let's do this.

15:13.163 --> 15:15.749
Bert, we need to talk.

15:16.041 --> 15:19.545
- What happened to you?
- Rock, rock, water fountain.

15:22.631 --> 15:26.760
I am not proud of this, but I've been
envious of your recent success.

15:27.595 --> 15:28.679
Wow.

15:28.846 --> 15:31.682
I won the MacArthur Grant,
everyone's jealous of me...

15:32.057 --> 15:34.810
Once I get Lasik,
I'll be out of things to wish for.

15:36.562 --> 15:40.524
I was hoping by admitting my weakness
to you, I'd somehow be unburdened.

15:40.691 --> 15:41.817
Is it working?

15:42.026 --> 15:44.695
No, now that you know my weakness
I hate you more than ever.

15:46.155 --> 15:48.824
Well, you know, we're both pretty smart.

15:48.991 --> 15:52.036
I bet if we put our heads together,
we could come up with a solution.

15:53.579 --> 15:55.873
Hang on. You're my enemy.

15:56.707 --> 16:01.128
Now if the enemy of my enemy is my friend,
and right now I'm my own worst enemy,

16:01.337 --> 16:03.380
that makes you my friend...
Okay, I'm good to go.

16:04.923 --> 16:06.925
Great, now that we're friends,

16:07.092 --> 16:09.637
wanna see if we can get tickets
to a taping of <i>Ellen?</i>

16:13.223 --> 16:17.144
- You know what, this isn't going to work.
- Sheldon, wait.

16:18.062 --> 16:21.398
You know,
you've got a lot to be happy about.

16:21.565 --> 16:24.985
You're at the top of your field,
you have a great girlfriend.

16:25.152 --> 16:28.572
Yes! That's right, I have Amy!

16:31.992 --> 16:34.995
In the past,
you've professed feelings for her.

16:35.204 --> 16:38.374
Does it eat you up inside that I have her
and you don't?

16:38.582 --> 16:43.337
It used to. But now that I'm rich
and successful, I think I can do better.

16:46.548 --> 16:48.217
I can't believe you punched Bert.

16:50.094 --> 16:51.762
I didn't punch him.

16:51.929 --> 16:55.265
He turned around and I gave him
a Captain Kirk karate chop.

16:57.101 --> 16:58.811
Not even sure he knows I did it.

17:00.437 --> 17:04.024
Hey, Sheldon, I've got someone here
who might make you feel better.

17:04.191 --> 17:05.442
<i>Hello, Sheldon.</i>

17:05.609 --> 17:07.403
Professor Hawking?

17:07.820 --> 17:11.532
<i>I understand you're struggling
with professional jealousy.</i>

17:11.824 --> 17:14.034
Thanks, Leonard,
now he's not gonna think I'm cool!

17:15.661 --> 17:20.958
<i>Don't worry, I know how you feel.
I have never won a Nobel Prize.</i>

17:21.291 --> 17:23.794
Oh, wow, that doesn't seem fair.

17:24.086 --> 17:26.588
<i>It's fine, I've been on</i> The Simpsons.

17:28.799 --> 17:31.677
But how do you deal with the success
of your colleagues?

17:31.885 --> 17:36.682
<i>I remind myself
every scientific advancement is a victory.</i>

17:36.890 --> 17:39.601
<i>Also, I was on</i> Star Trek.

17:41.311 --> 17:45.524
Oh, it was a good one. He played poker
with Sir Isaac... You don't care.

17:46.692 --> 17:51.488
<i>Don't waste your time on jealousy,
Sheldon, you're too brilliant.</i>

17:52.156 --> 17:55.200
How can you feel bad if Stephen Hawking
says you're brilliant?

17:55.784 --> 17:59.163
I can't. Thank you, Professor Hawking.

17:59.329 --> 18:03.792
You are a gift to mankind.
There should be statues of you everywhere.

18:04.001 --> 18:06.962
You know, the Lincoln Memorial has
a big chair, we could swap you right in.

18:10.007 --> 18:13.427
<i>I always thought a motorized toy of me
would be cool.</i>

18:17.347 --> 18:21.643
What a wonderful idea!
How does this man not have a Nobel?

18:22.102 --> 18:24.480
- Do not tell Wolowitz.
- Way ahead of you.

18:29.651 --> 18:34.364
A new study came out, and it said that
laughing makes your brain work better.

18:34.531 --> 18:37.785
And I know that's true because laughing
has made me the smartiest.

18:39.953 --> 18:42.706
Although, on the other hand,
babies laugh a lot and they're dumb.

18:44.416 --> 18:47.419
Do people know about her?
'Cause she's delightful.

19:16.990 --> 19:17.991
