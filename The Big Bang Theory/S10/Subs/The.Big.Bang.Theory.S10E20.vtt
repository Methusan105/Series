WEBVTT

00:03.755 --> 00:05.048
Leonard, if you're not busy tomorrow,

00:05.215 --> 00:06.925
I have to do a little reception
after work.

00:07.092 --> 00:10.261
Oh! I would, but we need to make a push
on the Air Force project.

00:10.845 --> 00:13.264
Are you sure?
We're celebrating our new ADD drug.

00:13.431 --> 00:15.433
I mean, it'll probably be over in,
like, six minutes.

00:17.435 --> 00:19.604
Did you say you guys are working on
the guidance system tomorrow?

00:19.771 --> 00:20.772
Yeah, why?

00:20.939 --> 00:22.440
Well, Sheldon said that
he was gonna work with me

00:22.607 --> 00:23.942
on our quantum perception project.

00:24.651 --> 00:26.111
We've had this planned for a week.

00:26.319 --> 00:27.946
Well, he reconfirmed with me this morning.

00:28.113 --> 00:31.616
Guys, before this gets ugly,
remember, the winner gets Sheldon.

00:33.535 --> 00:35.245
Hey, Raj,
do you wanna go with me tomorrow?

00:35.453 --> 00:37.831
Are you asking because
you want me there or out of pity?

00:37.997 --> 00:39.374
Actually, never mind, don't answer.

00:39.582 --> 00:40.583
I'd love to.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.629
- Hello.
- Why did you tell Leonard

00:44.796 --> 00:46.423
you're working on the gyroscope tomorrow?

00:46.589 --> 00:47.590
Because I am.

00:47.924 --> 00:49.217
But you said you were working with me.

00:49.718 --> 00:52.762
Uh-oh. Someone's got two dates
to the nerd prom.

00:54.973 --> 00:57.976
I have a plan to work on
both projects simultaneously.

00:58.143 --> 00:59.644
And for your information,

00:59.811 --> 01:02.772
the summer conference on
algebraic topology at Caltech

01:02.939 --> 01:03.982
is nerd prom.

01:05.608 --> 01:06.985
I'm sorry, what is this plan you have?

01:07.235 --> 01:10.029
Hmm. I'm not needed at both places
at the same time.

01:10.196 --> 01:12.824
And I can also free up extra hours
with simple tricks,

01:12.991 --> 01:16.035
such as using a minimal amount of words
to convey my point.

01:16.661 --> 01:18.079
When does that start?

01:19.706 --> 01:20.707
Soon.

01:21.332 --> 01:22.333
See, I could've said "in the near future,"

01:22.542 --> 01:23.668
but I didn't say "in the near future"

01:23.835 --> 01:25.837
because "in the near future"
is three more words than "soon."

01:26.838 --> 01:29.674
"In" one, "the" two,
"near" three, "future" four.

01:29.841 --> 01:31.426
See, "in the near future" is four,
"soon" is just one,

01:31.593 --> 01:33.553
four is more than one.
Saving time already.

01:36.055 --> 01:37.056
Genius.

01:37.766 --> 01:40.685
I was going to say, "Why does anyone think
Sheldon's a genius?"

01:41.144 --> 01:42.145
But I didn't.

02:10.673 --> 02:14.552
Gentlemen, I've got Amy up and running.
Shall we get to work?

02:14.886 --> 02:16.262
Uh, before we do,

02:16.429 --> 02:19.140
what are you wearing,
O Friend Who We Pretend Is Normal?

02:20.391 --> 02:24.062
These are hydration backpacks.
They're for efficiency.

02:24.229 --> 02:26.564
Whenever I'm thirsty,
I have access to water.

02:26.731 --> 02:29.067
And when I'm hungry, uh, lentil soup.

02:31.444 --> 02:32.612
It's getting harder to pretend.

02:33.822 --> 02:36.241
Anyway, Sheldon, we're at a decision point
to run the xenon stream

02:36.407 --> 02:38.743
through the cryocooler
or through the vacuum filter.

02:38.910 --> 02:40.745
Well, run down the pros and cons
of each for me.

02:41.079 --> 02:42.831
Well, if we run the xenon stream
through the cryocooler,

02:42.997 --> 02:45.416
it'll be cooled immediately
before it reacts with the conduction...

02:50.171 --> 02:53.007
Oh, sorry... Carrot chunk.

02:55.385 --> 02:56.928
You can just feel the time being saved.

02:59.389 --> 03:01.850
Ah, I'm back.
You've got me for eight minutes.

03:02.350 --> 03:03.518
Sheldon, this is silly.

03:03.685 --> 03:07.021
You can't expect us to do quality work
with you popping in and out like this.

03:07.188 --> 03:09.357
The coefficient isn't lambda.
It's lambda sub one.

03:09.649 --> 03:11.776
And, over here,
you should consider the possibility

03:11.943 --> 03:14.320
that the brain itself
is in two different quantum states,

03:14.487 --> 03:16.322
and then, lastly,
do you have any little soup crackers?

03:18.449 --> 03:21.119
The rate of spinning
for the central axis centrifuge

03:21.286 --> 03:23.371
has to be four revolutions per second.

03:23.538 --> 03:25.623
It can't be four revolutions.
It's gotta be seven.

03:25.790 --> 03:28.001
Seven? Look at the board. It's four.

03:28.167 --> 03:30.128
- Oh, my God, It's seven. Seven.
- Four.

03:30.336 --> 03:31.337
It's five and a half.

03:32.589 --> 03:33.882
Son of a bitch, it's five and a half.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.760
BRB. You know, that's short for
"Be right back."

03:37.927 --> 03:39.470
I'm saving so much time.

03:41.514 --> 03:46.144
Two signals meet up
in the corpus callosum, and T equals zero.

03:46.311 --> 03:48.646
And I know a boy
who just earned a slurp of soup.

03:50.481 --> 03:54.110
Incredible. Sheldon, I didn't expect
that you could work on both projects,

03:54.277 --> 03:55.862
but I was wrong.

03:56.070 --> 03:57.697
You know, I felt the same way
about the spork.

03:58.364 --> 04:01.492
Solids and liquids handled by one utensil?
That'll never work.

04:02.201 --> 04:03.494
Spoiler, works.

04:05.246 --> 04:06.247
I gotta admit,

04:06.414 --> 04:08.082
we didn't think you'd be able to do
two things at once.

04:08.333 --> 04:10.919
I felt the same way about the platypus.

04:11.127 --> 04:13.880
You know, bird and mammal
in the same creature? No way.

04:14.047 --> 04:15.506
Spoiler, way.

04:19.802 --> 04:21.012
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:21.179 --> 04:24.015
Oh, thanks again for
letting me use your laptop last night.

04:24.265 --> 04:25.266
No problem.

04:25.892 --> 04:26.935
Just doing my taxes.

04:27.393 --> 04:28.394
Okay.

04:28.728 --> 04:30.939
Actually, if I can...
I could just check one more thing...

04:31.189 --> 04:33.191
- I already cleared the browser history.
- You're a good woman.

04:35.860 --> 04:36.861
Whatcha working on?

04:37.070 --> 04:39.405
Trying to catch up on office emails
before I go back.

04:40.031 --> 04:42.909
Oh, that's right.
Maternity leave's almost over.

04:43.117 --> 04:44.202
Oh, you excited?

04:44.869 --> 04:46.037
Yeah, I mean,

04:47.038 --> 04:49.707
I'll miss Halley,
but it'll be nice to get out of the house.

04:50.124 --> 04:52.001
Be intellectually stimulated.

04:52.168 --> 04:54.963
Go out to lunch instead of,
you know, be lunch.

04:57.382 --> 04:58.633
That's great. Good for you.

04:59.717 --> 05:02.220
Yeah, I mean, there's you and my parents.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.472
- She's gonna be fine.
- Well, of course she is.

05:04.889 --> 05:05.890
And that day care is great.

05:06.057 --> 05:09.644
It is. I went to check it out,
and they are very cautious about

05:09.811 --> 05:12.146
letting strange men with no kids
peek in the windows.

05:15.608 --> 05:18.528
Plus, I think I'm setting
a good example for Halley,

05:18.945 --> 05:22.490
to show her that women can be mothers
and still have satisfying careers.

05:23.032 --> 05:26.035
Sure, she won't know where I went
or if I'm ever coming back.

05:26.327 --> 05:27.537
That'll just make the 10 minutes between

05:27.704 --> 05:30.415
when I get home and her bedtime
even more special.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.543
Uh...

05:33.710 --> 05:36.713
Other than burp you or give you a bottle,
I don't know what to do right now.

05:38.381 --> 05:41.134
It's okay,
I'm just being emotional about this.

05:42.010 --> 05:43.302
Can you not tell Howard?

05:44.012 --> 05:47.724
Oh. Don't you think it'd be healthier
if you told him what's going on with you?

05:48.224 --> 05:50.893
Don't you think it'd be healthier
if you had your own apartment, grown man?

05:53.646 --> 05:55.148
Your secret is safe with me.

05:59.569 --> 06:02.321
Hey, since when do you do laundry
on a Thursday?

06:02.780 --> 06:04.741
Oh, I had an accident at work.

06:04.949 --> 06:07.452
I slipped and fell on my soup sack.

06:09.162 --> 06:11.956
You know, there was a time I would say,
"What's a soup sack?"

06:12.123 --> 06:14.625
But I'm glad we're past that.

06:18.421 --> 06:20.548
You know, there was a time
I would say, "God bless you,"

06:20.757 --> 06:23.134
and then you would say,
"If you must invoke an imaginary deity,

06:23.301 --> 06:24.302
"how about Thor?"

06:24.886 --> 06:26.137
And I would say,

06:26.345 --> 06:27.638
"How do you know I didn't mean Thor?"

06:27.805 --> 06:29.015
And then you would say, "Touche,"

06:29.182 --> 06:32.185
and that there ends the tale of
why I no longer say, "God bless you."

06:34.854 --> 06:36.981
- Well, we have had some fun, haven't we?
- Oh, yeah.

06:38.816 --> 06:40.526
So, Leonard tells me
you've had a busy day.

06:40.735 --> 06:42.820
Hmm? I did. It hasn't stopped.

06:42.987 --> 06:45.490
I figured out a solution
for our navigation system

06:45.656 --> 06:47.742
while I was pre-soaking lentils
out of my pants.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.245
You getting sick?

06:51.537 --> 06:53.372
Of course not. I'm too busy to be sick.

06:53.831 --> 06:54.832
Well, you're pretty delicate.

06:54.999 --> 06:56.584
Maybe you shouldn't be
pushing yourself so hard.

06:56.834 --> 06:57.835
I'm fine.

06:58.002 --> 07:01.297
All right, well, we'll just pretend that
you didn't catch a cold watching <i>Frozen.</i>

07:02.757 --> 07:03.758
That didn't happen.

07:03.966 --> 07:05.218
You also got a nosebleed watching <i>Up.</i>

07:05.384 --> 07:06.469
Just do your laundry!

07:10.890 --> 07:12.767
Stuart. You didn't have to make dinner.

07:13.017 --> 07:15.686
Well, I felt bad about
upsetting you this morning.

07:16.062 --> 07:19.107
And to be honest,
I'm not the biggest fan of your meatloaf.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.778
- Hey, what's for dinner?
- Meatloaf.

07:24.112 --> 07:26.322
- Oh. Cool.
- Stuart made it.

07:26.531 --> 07:27.824
Oh, cool.

07:29.867 --> 07:33.538
Hey, I was thinking maybe we take Halley
to the zoo this weekend.

07:33.704 --> 07:36.541
Get in a little family time
before you go back to work.

07:37.542 --> 07:38.543
Sounds great.

07:38.709 --> 07:42.380
Speaking of which, for day care,
it'll be easy for me to drop her off

07:42.547 --> 07:43.673
unless you wanna do it.

07:44.215 --> 07:46.008
Hmm. Guess it should be me.

07:46.551 --> 07:49.387
I can't do it.
They have a picture of me on file now.

07:55.977 --> 07:57.019
You okay?

07:57.395 --> 07:58.437
Of course, why?

07:58.771 --> 08:00.815
Well, I don't know.
You seem a little upset.

08:00.982 --> 08:02.525
- No, I'm fine.
- You sure?

08:02.817 --> 08:05.987
Why don't you think she's fine?
She sounds fine. She looks fine.

08:06.154 --> 08:08.698
If I saw her on the street,
I'd say, "Damn, that girl's fine."

08:14.162 --> 08:15.872
Sheldon, you're sick. Go back to bed.

08:16.038 --> 08:17.415
I am fine.

08:18.457 --> 08:20.668
Here, eat your toast.

08:25.173 --> 08:26.340
Sorry.

08:28.092 --> 08:29.427
It's okay. Now, I don't need butter.

08:32.138 --> 08:34.599
Oh, perhaps I am a little
under the weather.

08:34.765 --> 08:37.185
It's nothing a little cold medicine
and tea can't fix.

08:37.727 --> 08:38.728
You need sleep.

08:38.895 --> 08:40.855
What I need, is to get to work.

08:41.022 --> 08:42.773
Well, I don't want your germs around me.

08:43.441 --> 08:47.612
You hold my hand, you kiss my mouth,
but you draw the line at 102 fever?

08:49.447 --> 08:50.489
What happened to our love?

08:55.411 --> 08:57.246
Sheldon, are you okay?

08:59.916 --> 09:00.917
What's going on?

09:03.127 --> 09:04.295
How'd I get here?

09:04.795 --> 09:07.006
I don't know.
We came home from work and we found you.

09:07.924 --> 09:08.966
Home from work?

09:09.800 --> 09:11.677
- What time is it?
- It's 9:00.

09:11.969 --> 09:13.012
9:00?

09:13.721 --> 09:17.099
Wait, what happened to 8:00, and 7:00,
and all the other o'clocks?

09:17.975 --> 09:19.352
Uh, you don't remember?

09:19.685 --> 09:22.980
Well, I remember waking up in the morning.

09:23.314 --> 09:25.608
Amy rubbing Vick's on my chest.

09:26.067 --> 09:29.153
And her hands were like
two frozen chunks of tundra.

09:31.489 --> 09:34.158
I took some cold medicine to...

09:34.742 --> 09:35.993
I took cold medicine.

09:37.370 --> 09:39.789
You did seem a little loopy
when you showed up at the lab.

09:40.414 --> 09:41.749
At the lab.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.753
Why am I naked from the waist down?

09:48.756 --> 09:49.840
I don't know where your pants are,

09:50.007 --> 09:52.260
but we did find your underwear
in a pot on the stove.

10:00.351 --> 10:02.895
My pants are missing,
I don't remember anything.

10:03.896 --> 10:05.606
Penny, this is your youth, what do I do?

10:08.317 --> 10:11.237
I don't know. Check your body for tattoos?

10:13.322 --> 10:15.366
- Leonard, would you be a lamb...
- She's kidding.

10:19.036 --> 10:21.956
Wait, wait. Where's my bag?
My phone and my wallet are in my bag.

10:22.123 --> 10:23.332
It's right here.

10:27.044 --> 10:29.505
Where's my notebook?
My notebook's gone. Oh, no.

10:29.714 --> 10:31.382
Okay, it's just a notebook.
What's the big deal?

10:31.716 --> 10:32.800
"What's the big deal?"

10:32.967 --> 10:35.386
It's full of classified information
about the Air Force project.

10:35.553 --> 10:36.721
How could you lose that?

10:38.222 --> 10:39.724
It's okay. I'm sure we'll find it.

10:39.932 --> 10:41.350
Look, it's gotta be around here somewhere.

10:42.643 --> 10:43.978
Maybe it's wherever your pants are.

10:45.980 --> 10:48.524
Nope. Pants in the microwave. No notebook.

10:52.111 --> 10:53.195
Hey.

10:53.404 --> 10:54.613
Hello.

10:55.072 --> 10:57.074
Something's going on
with Bernadette.

10:57.491 --> 10:58.492
She say anything to you?

10:59.493 --> 11:00.661
Nope, not a word.

11:00.995 --> 11:02.038
Come on, be honest.

11:02.413 --> 11:04.790
Did you tell her I tried her breast pump?

11:11.088 --> 11:12.923
No, but I did mention it to my therapist.

11:17.345 --> 11:19.680
I know she's mad at me about something.

11:19.847 --> 11:22.224
Well, what have you done
that would upset her?

11:22.725 --> 11:25.686
Oh. Gosh, how much time do you have?

11:27.271 --> 11:29.607
Why don't you just
start with the worst thing?

11:29.774 --> 11:31.275
Hmm. Let's see.

11:32.109 --> 11:33.986
Okay, here we go. Six years ago,

11:34.653 --> 11:39.533
I got a call that
Bernie's Great-Aunt Trixie died.

11:41.118 --> 11:42.119
And?

11:42.370 --> 11:44.080
I forgot to give her the message.

11:47.041 --> 11:48.125
That's terrible.

11:48.584 --> 11:50.878
The terrible part is ever since then

11:51.087 --> 11:54.590
I've been sending Bernie
Christmas cards from Trixie.

11:55.466 --> 11:56.634
Oh...

11:57.802 --> 11:58.803
Howard.

11:58.969 --> 12:00.304
Let me finish,
and one card had $5 in it

12:00.471 --> 12:01.639
I took from Bernie's purse.

12:05.810 --> 12:07.353
The notebook isn't in the bathroom.

12:07.895 --> 12:10.398
I can't find it either.
How can he not remember a day?

12:10.773 --> 12:13.317
Well, people who are
abducted by aliens lose time.

12:13.484 --> 12:15.528
I mean, maybe it happens
to the aliens, too.

12:19.073 --> 12:21.367
- Well, it's not across the hall.
- That's it.

12:21.659 --> 12:25.579
I'm in breach of my security clearance.
I'm going to prison.

12:25.830 --> 12:27.665
You know what happens to
people like me in prison.

12:29.333 --> 12:32.002
I'll be forced to be
some large man's tutor.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.800
You're not going to prison.

12:38.175 --> 12:40.511
But, boy, it is funny to think about.

12:42.012 --> 12:44.849
- You really can't remember anything?
- I'm trying.

12:45.099 --> 12:47.268
Wait a minute. Hey, let me see your phone.

12:48.185 --> 12:49.270
Why?

12:49.437 --> 12:51.814
It's possible
it was tracking everywhere you went.

12:52.106 --> 12:54.525
- Phones can do that?
- Yeah. Depends on the privacy settings.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.610
Wow. That's so cool.

12:56.944 --> 12:59.405
How do you, uh...
How do you turn that thing off?

13:01.699 --> 13:04.827
Relax. I know when you go for a run,
you stop for a donut.

13:06.162 --> 13:07.705
I don't even run there. I drive.

13:11.250 --> 13:13.127
Hang on. I can see every place you went.

13:13.544 --> 13:14.712
What does it say?

13:14.879 --> 13:18.382
Uh, you were in the building,
you were at the university,

13:19.049 --> 13:22.011
then you were somewhere on
Colorado Boulevard.

13:22.553 --> 13:24.472
- Where?
- Wait, hang on.

13:25.723 --> 13:27.683
- Did you go to a cowboy bar?
- I...

13:28.851 --> 13:31.645
No! That is preposterous.

13:40.696 --> 13:41.780
Maybe.

13:46.410 --> 13:48.078
Hey, how's it going?

13:48.245 --> 13:49.914
- Fine.
- Good.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.083
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

13:53.250 --> 13:54.460
Love you more.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.337
Okay, you won.
Can I finish what I'm doing?

13:58.380 --> 13:59.548
Sure, sorry.

14:05.262 --> 14:06.388
Something on your mind?

14:06.597 --> 14:07.932
No, nothing.

14:08.807 --> 14:12.686
Okay, well, maybe I'm just feeling like
something's bothering you.

14:13.395 --> 14:14.438
Nope, all good.

14:15.105 --> 14:17.274
Prove it. Make love to me
right now on the kitchen floor.

14:19.818 --> 14:21.403
No. What is wrong with you?

14:21.570 --> 14:22.863
A-ha! You are upset.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.533
I don't know a lot about women,
but I know I upset them.

14:28.452 --> 14:32.456
Howard, I'm sorry if I'm being weird,
but it has nothing to do with you.

14:32.873 --> 14:34.542
- It doesn't?
- No.

14:36.460 --> 14:37.795
I didn't want to tell you,

14:38.504 --> 14:41.382
but I'm having a really tough time
about going back to work.

14:41.632 --> 14:42.716
Oh.

14:43.133 --> 14:46.762
Okay. Well, I get that.
It was hard for me when I went back.

14:46.971 --> 14:47.972
It was?

14:48.138 --> 14:50.307
Of course. I missed you, and the baby,

14:50.474 --> 14:52.977
and being able to watch <i>Ellen</i> every day.

14:55.396 --> 14:57.731
I just don't know
what the right thing to do is.

14:57.982 --> 15:00.109
If I go back to work,
I'm abandoning Halley.

15:00.276 --> 15:03.362
If I don't go,
I'm giving up everything I've worked for.

15:04.321 --> 15:06.115
It's like there's no right choice.

15:06.490 --> 15:09.118
Look, I don't know
what the best decision is either,

15:10.244 --> 15:13.664
but whatever we choose,
if we're not happy,

15:14.582 --> 15:15.791
we can undo it.

15:16.166 --> 15:17.167
I guess.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.420
And the best part is
Halley won't remember a thing.

15:19.670 --> 15:22.339
Babies are cute,
but they're dumb.

15:24.633 --> 15:27.511
I go like this, she thinks I'm gone.
Then magically I'm back.

15:30.180 --> 15:32.016
Honestly, why are we saving for college?

15:34.685 --> 15:36.937
I'm not crazy about you
calling our baby dumb.

15:37.146 --> 15:39.106
Well, she gets it from me.

15:40.190 --> 15:43.360
Speaking of which,
I have some news about your Aunt Trixie.

15:51.660 --> 15:53.912
Does this place look familiar?

15:54.079 --> 15:55.372
It's hard to say.

15:55.581 --> 15:57.249
Hey! Sheldon's back!

15:57.416 --> 15:58.751
Sheldon!

16:01.170 --> 16:02.171
It's getting clearer.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.758
You gonna buy another round for the house?

16:06.884 --> 16:08.260
No, thank you.

16:09.053 --> 16:11.388
We now know
why MasterCard sent me a fraud alert.

16:13.182 --> 16:14.266
Ask him.

16:14.600 --> 16:17.770
Um. Yes, howdy, partner.

16:18.312 --> 16:20.856
Do you happen to recollect
if I left a notebook

16:21.023 --> 16:22.191
in these here parts?

16:23.400 --> 16:24.735
"These here parts?"

16:25.027 --> 16:27.279
It's called fitting in.
By the way, good luck.

16:28.864 --> 16:31.075
- Here you go.
- Oh! Thank goodness.

16:31.283 --> 16:33.577
One top secret quantum guidance system.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.247
You understood the math?

16:37.414 --> 16:40.584
No, Sheldon told me all about it.
He told everybody.

16:43.295 --> 16:44.463
That's just great.

16:44.838 --> 16:48.008
Oh, don't worry. He made us pinky swear
we'd keep it a secret.

16:50.594 --> 16:53.555
- I swear...
- I swear...

16:53.764 --> 16:57.351
- Not to tell anyone...
- Not to tell anyone...

16:57.935 --> 17:01.522
The top secret military
information I'm about to tell you.

17:01.689 --> 17:05.609
The top secret military
information I'm about to tell you.

17:07.778 --> 17:08.779
We really need to skedaddle.

17:09.113 --> 17:10.948
- Thank you.
- Bye. See you.

17:14.952 --> 17:16.286
I should probably erase this.

17:23.836 --> 17:25.796
Thank you for making me tea.

17:26.004 --> 17:27.172
You're welcome. How is it?

17:31.343 --> 17:32.511
Yummy.

17:33.095 --> 17:34.513
And warm on my back.

17:36.974 --> 17:38.267
Do you need anything else?

17:39.143 --> 17:40.644
You know exactly what I need.

17:41.395 --> 17:42.438
Fine.

17:48.444 --> 17:53.449
<i>Soft kitty, warm kitty
Little ball of fur</i>

17:53.949 --> 17:59.204
<i>Happy kitty, sleepy kitty
Purr, purr, purr</i>

18:00.664 --> 18:02.166
That's nice.

18:03.167 --> 18:04.293
Now, in German.

18:20.476 --> 18:21.518
Great.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.228
Now Mandarin.

18:39.036 --> 18:40.370
Now Navajo.

19:09.817 --> 19:10.818
English - SDH
