00:03.295 --> 00:05.297
[Sheldon speaking in mandarin]

00:05.797 --> 00:06.840
No, it's:

00:07.007 --> 00:09.009
[Speaking in mandarin]

00:10.469 --> 00:12.471
[Speaking in mandarin]

00:14.515 --> 00:16.266
What's this?

00:17.351 --> 00:19.102
That's what you did.

00:19.269 --> 00:23.565
I assumed, as in a number of languages,
that the gesture was part of the phrase.

00:23.732 --> 00:26.318
- Well, it's not.
- Why am I supposed to know that?

00:26.485 --> 00:29.988
As teacher, it's your obligation
to separate your personal idiosyncrasies...

00:30.155 --> 00:31.615
From the subject matter.

00:32.157 --> 00:34.952
- I'm glad you decided to learn mandarin.
- —why?

00:35.118 --> 00:39.039
Once you're fluent, you'll have a
billion more people to annoy instead of me.

00:40.666 --> 00:41.708
Hey.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.919
[Speaking in mandarin]

00:44.336 --> 00:47.631
You just called Leonard
a syphilitic donkey.

00:48.590 --> 00:52.219
My apologies, Leonard.
I'm only as good as my teacher.

00:53.095 --> 00:54.429
Why are you learning Chinese?

00:54.721 --> 00:57.849
I believe the szechuan palace
has been passing off orange chicken...

00:58.016 --> 01:01.186
As tangerine chicken,
and I intend to confront them.

01:02.145 --> 01:05.899
If I were you, I'd be more concerned
about what they're passing off as chicken.

01:08.986 --> 01:12.197
- I need to use your window.
- Oh, hey. Yeah, no, sure, go ahead.

01:13.615 --> 01:16.618
Hey, jerk face. You forgot your iPod.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.747
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

01:20.914 --> 01:24.585
That stupid, self-centered bastard
wrote about our sex life in his blog.

01:27.170 --> 01:30.591
Drop dead,
you stupid, self-centered bastard.

01:32.175 --> 01:33.677
Thank you.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.307
Okay, where were we?

01:38.849 --> 01:42.060
Not now. I have a blog to find.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.508
Penny, are you okay?

02:13.675 --> 02:16.887
Penny:
I'm fine, Leonard. Just go away.

02:17.554 --> 02:20.474
I understand that breaking up
with someone can be very painful...

02:20.641 --> 02:23.560
- Go away!
- Okay, feel better, bye.

02:28.732 --> 02:30.275
She doesn't wanna talk.

02:31.735 --> 02:32.778
Not surprising.

02:32.944 --> 02:37.407
Penny's emotional responses originate in the
primitive portion of brain, the amygdala.

02:37.574 --> 02:40.369
While speech is centered
in the recently developed neocortex.

02:40.535 --> 02:43.330
Former can overpower the latter
giving scientific credence...

02:43.497 --> 02:46.333
To the notion
of being rendered speechless.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.965
Or maybe she just doesn't wanna talk.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.512
Hey, look, I found an iPod.

03:02.182 --> 03:05.310
It's smashed beyond repair.
What are you gonna do with it?

03:05.894 --> 03:09.189
What else?
Sell it on eBay as slightly used.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.983
It was penny's boyfriend's.
They broke up.

03:12.150 --> 03:16.029
Apparently, he posted intimate details of
their physical relationship on his blog...

03:16.196 --> 03:19.241
Which I cannot find anywhere.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.911
You know what? I'm gonna go back
and try talking to her again.

03:23.078 --> 03:26.123
Good idea.
Sit with her, hold her, comfort her.

03:26.289 --> 03:30.502
And if the moment feels right,
see if you can cop a feel.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.922
I'm not going to do that, Howard.

03:34.089 --> 03:37.884
I'm not aware of any social convention
that requires you to intervene at all.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.845
What about damsel in distress?

03:40.011 --> 03:43.640
Twelfth-century code of chivalry?
Not exactly current.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.768
You'd also have to be knighted
for that to apply.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.855
I don't care.
She's upset, I'm going over there.

03:50.021 --> 03:53.400
Remember to sit on your hands a bit
so they're warm.

03:54.484 --> 03:57.821
I'm her friend. I'm not going
to take advantage of her vulnerability.

03:58.822 --> 04:02.242
So you're saying, if in the depths of
despair she throws herself at you...

04:02.409 --> 04:06.037
And demands you take her right there,
right now, you'll just walk away?

04:06.997 --> 04:09.666
I said I'm her friend, not her gay friend.

04:12.627 --> 04:14.337
[Knocking on door]

04:14.504 --> 04:16.506
Hey, I know you said
you didn't wanna talk...

04:16.673 --> 04:18.216
- I don't.
- Okay, sorry.

04:18.842 --> 04:21.303
- Wait.
- Wait. Did you say wait?

04:23.263 --> 04:24.806
Tell me the truth.

04:24.973 --> 04:28.059
Am I just an idiot who picks giant losers?

04:28.226 --> 04:29.686
No, no.

04:29.853 --> 04:33.398
Okay, so I pick good guys,
but turn them into losers?

04:33.565 --> 04:34.608
Of course not.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.736
Well, it's gotta be one or the other.
Which is it?

04:43.617 --> 04:45.994
I'm sorry. What were the choices again?

04:46.161 --> 04:48.288
I really thought Mike was different.

04:48.455 --> 04:51.541
I thought he was sensitive and smart.

04:51.708 --> 04:52.709
I mean, not you smart.

04:52.876 --> 04:56.046
- Normal non-freaky smart.
- Yeah, no, sure.

04:56.213 --> 04:58.882
You know, and then he just goes
and has to humiliate me...

04:59.049 --> 05:02.677
By writing about me on his blog
so the entire world can read it.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.930
Actually, it's not all that easy to find.

05:05.096 --> 05:08.558
Yeah, really? Well, my friends at work
found it, my sister found it.

05:08.725 --> 05:13.772
Judging by my e-mail, a number of prisoners
at the Michigan state penitentiary found it.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.899
What exactly did this guy write?

05:16.066 --> 05:18.652
Not that I need to know
the details of your sex life.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.028
I just thought...

05:20.487 --> 05:22.113
Never mind.

05:22.531 --> 05:24.074
No, you know what?

05:24.241 --> 05:27.452
Might as well read it,
everybody else has. Go ahead.

05:27.619 --> 05:31.039
Oh, god, I just feel so betrayed
and embarrassed.

05:31.206 --> 05:34.501
I just wanna crawl into a hole and die.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.173
Okay, well, you know, this isn't that bad.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.802
It just paints the picture
of a very affectionate woman...

05:43.969 --> 05:49.307
Who's open to expressing her affection
in nontraditional locales.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.309
Oh, god.

05:51.476 --> 05:56.606
Elevators, parks, movie theaters.

05:57.524 --> 05:58.900
Out of curiosity...

05:59.067 --> 06:03.238
Is this subway, the transportation
system, or subway, the sandwich shop?

06:04.364 --> 06:06.241
Sandwich shop.

06:07.409 --> 06:09.661
Doesn't that violate
the health code or...?

06:10.120 --> 06:12.205
No, at the sub shop,
we were only making out.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.291
Ah, okay.

06:14.457 --> 06:18.920
But my point is that you have absolutely
no reason to be embarrassed.

06:19.838 --> 06:22.299
Really? Do you think I overreacted?

06:22.465 --> 06:25.468
- Maybe a little.
- Because I do that, I do overreact.

06:25.635 --> 06:28.013
- Maybe I should call Mike and apologize.
- No, no.

06:28.179 --> 06:30.724
No, that would be under-reacting.

06:31.641 --> 06:34.477
He did break the implied confidentiality
of the bedroom...

06:34.644 --> 06:38.857
And in your case, the elevator,
parks and fast-food franchise.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.567
Yes, you're right.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.861
I should just say I am done with him.

06:43.028 --> 06:44.821
Yes you should. Go ahead, say it.

06:45.447 --> 06:48.074
But I never gave the man a chance
to explain.

06:48.783 --> 06:51.244
What is there to explain?
It's all right here.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.371
It's betrayal.

06:53.538 --> 06:55.790
No, you were right the first time.

06:55.957 --> 06:57.792
This is a man who loves me...

06:57.959 --> 07:02.505
But in his own stupid way was just
trying to show people how he feels.

07:03.506 --> 07:06.092
I'm pretty sure I never said that.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.763
No, you did better than that.
You helped me see it on my own.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.306
Oh, good for me.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.644
- Where are you going?
- I'm going over to Mike's.

07:15.810 --> 07:18.605
- Leonard, thank you so much.
- Oh, sure.

07:25.362 --> 07:27.697
Maybe I am her gay friend.

07:34.245 --> 07:36.539
Howard, I'm going
to need another mandarin lesson.

07:36.706 --> 07:40.126
I obviously didn't make my point
with those people.

07:40.752 --> 07:43.213
For god's sake,
if you don't like tangerine chicken...

07:43.380 --> 07:44.923
Don't order tangerine chicken.

07:45.090 --> 07:48.301
I like tangerine chicken.
I'm just not getting tangerine chicken.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.472
- Can we please change the subject?
- Sure.

07:52.889 --> 07:56.893
Tell us again how you screwed up and got
penny back together with her old boyfriend.

07:57.936 --> 08:00.105
Just roll the dice.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.903
"Enslaved by warlocks.
Stay here till you roll two, four or..."

08:07.070 --> 08:08.780
She was mad at him.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.283
She was done with him,
the relationship was broken...

08:12.450 --> 08:15.662
And I walked over there and I fixed it.

08:16.746 --> 08:19.624
Boy, that story gets better
every time you hear it.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.753
I thought the first two renditions
were far more compelling.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.423
Previously, I felt sympathy
for the Leonard character.

08:26.589 --> 08:29.592
Now I just find him
to be whiny and annoying.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.971
Just eat your tangerine chicken.

08:33.138 --> 08:36.016
I'd love to,
but I don't have tangerine chicken.

08:38.518 --> 08:42.439
Thank you so much
for your stupid advice.

08:47.610 --> 08:48.862
Incredible.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.865
You managed to screw up the screw-up.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.619
[Knocking on door]

08:57.829 --> 08:59.164
I'm back.

08:59.789 --> 09:03.376
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
It's not your fault.

09:03.793 --> 09:04.836
What happened?

09:05.003 --> 09:08.465
Well, I went over to Mike's
to make up with him...

09:08.631 --> 09:10.633
Yeah, no, I know that part.

09:11.134 --> 09:13.094
But he had already moved on.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.013
Already? That was quick.

09:15.180 --> 09:20.060
That's what I said to the woman
who had her legs wrapped around his neck.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.230
Oh, penny, I am so sorry.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.649
How could he do that?

09:26.816 --> 09:30.320
Oh, you know,
you did throw an 80-gig iPod...

09:30.487 --> 09:32.363
Yeah, no, how could he do that?

09:32.530 --> 09:36.076
I swear to god,
I am done with guys like that.

09:36.242 --> 09:40.205
You know, macho with the perfect body,
and the hair and the money.

09:40.371 --> 09:42.707
Yeah, that must get old quick.

09:43.249 --> 09:49.089
You know, just once, I would like to go out
with someone who is nice and honest...

09:49.255 --> 09:51.424
And who actually cares about me.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.093
[Whimpers]

09:53.384 --> 09:54.427
What about me?

09:55.303 --> 09:57.305
What about you what?

09:57.472 --> 09:59.265
[Crying]

09:59.432 --> 10:02.185
What about if you went out with me?

10:04.687 --> 10:06.022
Are you asking me out?

10:07.315 --> 10:11.069
Um, yes, I am asking you out.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.575
I was just going off your comment
about the nice guy...

10:17.742 --> 10:19.202
- No, I got that.
- And honest...

10:19.369 --> 10:20.954
-Yeah, totally. —so but...

10:21.121 --> 10:22.413
- It's no big deal.
- Yes.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.500
Yes, what?

10:25.875 --> 10:28.294
Yes, I will go out with you.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.174
Really?

10:36.469 --> 10:39.347
Why not?
I mean, what do I have to lose?

10:42.892 --> 10:44.769
That's the spirit.

10:50.108 --> 10:52.152
Show me your citrus peels.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.362
[Speaking in mandarin]

10:57.073 --> 10:58.992
Show me your citrus peels.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.202
[Speaking in mandarin]

11:02.704 --> 11:04.164
- Show me...
- Sheldon?

11:04.330 --> 11:06.332
[Speaking in mandarin]

11:07.208 --> 11:08.251
I'm sorry.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.004
Look, do you have a second?

11:11.171 --> 11:13.923
A second what? Pair of undenrvear?

11:14.090 --> 11:16.301
I was just wondering
if I could talk to you.

11:16.467 --> 11:17.510
It's about Leonard.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.847
Why me?
Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?

11:21.014 --> 11:23.516
Well, raj can't talk to me
unless he's drunk.

11:23.683 --> 11:27.145
And Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting.

11:27.937 --> 11:30.315
Sheldon: Yes, I suppose he is.

11:31.441 --> 11:34.027
All I'm saying
is you know Leonard the best.

11:34.194 --> 11:38.448
Not necessarily. I'm often surprised
by my lack of familiarity with Leonard.

11:38.615 --> 11:43.620
Just the other day, I discovered
he not only has a loofah, he hides it.

11:43.786 --> 11:46.581
Why do you suppose a man
would be ashamed of having a loofah?

11:46.748 --> 11:50.168
I myself prefer to have my excess
epithelial cells slough off naturally...

11:50.335 --> 11:53.630
But I don't condemn those
who seek to accelerate the process.

11:54.464 --> 11:58.468
And until recently, I had no idea
that despite his lactose intolerance...

11:58.635 --> 12:01.137
He can tolerate small amounts
of nonfat ice cream...

12:01.304 --> 12:03.223
Without producing a noxious gas...

12:03.389 --> 12:06.768
That, I maintain, in the right
concentration could be weaponized.

12:07.810 --> 12:10.271
Leonard might come home.
Can we talk in my apartment?

12:10.813 --> 12:12.690
We're not done?

12:14.025 --> 12:16.319
- No.
- Eh, why not?

12:16.486 --> 12:19.322
We're already through
the looking glass anyway.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.286
Okay, so here's the thing.

12:25.453 --> 12:28.414
I guess you're aware
that Leonard asked me out.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.333
Well, he didn't actually say anything.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.419
But when he came back to the apartment,
he was doing a dance...

12:33.586 --> 12:36.506
That brought to mind
the happy hippos in fantasia.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.092
Oh, that's nice.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.511
Anyhow,
the thing I wanted to talk to about is...

12:41.678 --> 12:45.056
You know, since Leonard
and I have become friends, I was just...

12:45.223 --> 12:46.266
Wanna sit down?

12:46.808 --> 12:49.269
Oh, I wish it were that simple.

12:50.937 --> 12:54.691
You see, I don't spend much time here,
and so I've never chosen a place to sit.

12:55.316 --> 12:56.776
Vveh, choose.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.946
There are a number of options and...

13:00.113 --> 13:02.907
I'm really not familiar enough
with the cushion densities...

13:03.074 --> 13:07.120
Air-flow patterns and dispersion
of sunlight to make an informed choice.

13:07.287 --> 13:11.040
Why don't you pick at random, if you don't
like it, sit somewhere else next time?

13:11.207 --> 13:13.209
No, no, that's crazy.

13:14.627 --> 13:18.047
You go ahead and talk
while I figure it out.

13:18.923 --> 13:19.966
Okay.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.468
Here's the thing.

13:22.635 --> 13:26.973
So I've known for a while now that
Leonard has had a little crush on me...

13:27.140 --> 13:28.891
A little crush?

13:29.225 --> 13:30.476
Well, I suppose so.

13:30.643 --> 13:34.480
In the same way menelaus
had a little crush on Helen of Troy.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.358
I don't really know who they are...

13:37.525 --> 13:40.903
- Menelaus was the brother of agamemnon...
- Yeah, I don't care. Listen.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.739
The point is...

13:42.905 --> 13:45.658
Leonard isn't the kind of guy
I usually go out with.

13:45.825 --> 13:49.287
Leonard isn't the kind of guy
anyone usually goes out with.

13:50.204 --> 13:53.082
Would you be open
to rotating the couch clockwise 30 degrees?

13:53.249 --> 13:57.712
No. What I'm saying is,
Leonard might be different in a good way.

13:58.129 --> 14:01.257
And obviously, my usual choices
have not worked out so well.

14:01.424 --> 14:05.595
Your last one worked out well
for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod.

14:07.138 --> 14:09.223
Oh, glare.

14:10.933 --> 14:14.437
If things don't go well with Leonard,
I risk losing a really good friend.

14:14.604 --> 14:16.356
I mean, he's not looking for a fling.

14:16.522 --> 14:20.485
He's the kind that gets into a relationship
for, like you would say, light-years.

14:20.651 --> 14:21.778
I would not say that.

14:22.945 --> 14:26.574
No one would say that. A light-year
is a unit of distance, not time.

14:26.741 --> 14:28.785
Thank you for the clarification.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.585
Draft.

14:38.127 --> 14:41.339
You see, people hear the word "year"
and they think duration.

14:41.506 --> 14:45.051
Foot-pound has the same problem.
That's a unit of work, not of weight.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.386
Right. Thanks.

14:46.552 --> 14:50.014
- It's a common mistake.
- Not the first one I've made today.

14:50.473 --> 14:51.724
Okay.

14:52.517 --> 14:55.019
I think this will be my seat.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.855
Do you have anything to say
that has anything to do...

14:58.022 --> 15:00.066
With, you know,
what I'm talking about?

15:00.817 --> 15:02.652
Well, let's see.

15:03.152 --> 15:05.154
We might consider schrodinger's cat.

15:05.822 --> 15:08.408
Schrodinger. Is that the woman in 2A?

15:08.574 --> 15:09.826
No, that's Mrs. Grossinger.

15:09.992 --> 15:13.496
She doesn't have a cat, she has a Mexican
hairless. Annoying little animal. Yip-yip-yip.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.164
Sheldon.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.667
Sorry, you diverted me.

15:17.834 --> 15:22.255
Anyway, in 1935, ennin schrodinger,
in an attempt to explain...

15:22.422 --> 15:26.092
The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum
physics, he proposed an experiment.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.887
A cat is placed in a box
with a sealed vial of poison...

15:30.054 --> 15:31.973
That will break open at a random time.

15:32.140 --> 15:35.935
Now, since no one knows
when or if the poison has been released...

15:36.102 --> 15:41.607
Until the box is opened, the cat
can be thought of as both alive and dead.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.197
I'm sorry, I don't get the point.

15:48.364 --> 15:51.409
Well, of course you don't get it.
I haven't made it yet.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.163
You have to be psychic,
there's no such thing...

15:55.329 --> 15:56.873
Sheldon, what's the point?

15:57.039 --> 16:00.710
Just like schrodinger's cat,
your potential relationship with Leonard...

16:00.877 --> 16:03.546
Right now
can be thought of as both good and bad.

16:03.713 --> 16:07.675
It is only by opening the box
that you'll find out which it is.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.387
Okay, so you're saying
I should go out with Leonard?

16:11.554 --> 16:13.556
No, no, no.

16:15.057 --> 16:18.144
Let me start again.
In 1935, ennin schrodinger...

16:20.688 --> 16:22.356
Two seats right there.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.694
[Speaking in mandarin]

16:34.160 --> 16:36.078
Sheldon, I think I've made a mistake.

16:36.245 --> 16:38.623
I can see that.
Unless you're running a marathon...

16:38.789 --> 16:42.919
Choosing both stuffing and mashed
potatoes is a starch-filled redundancy.

16:43.586 --> 16:44.837
No, it's about penny.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.798
A mistake involving penny.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.009
Okay, you'll have to narrow it down.

16:51.219 --> 16:53.221
I don't think
I can go out with her tonight.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.225
Other people would say, "why not?"

16:57.391 --> 16:59.602
Other people might be interested.

17:01.103 --> 17:03.981
- I'm gonna talk anyway.
- I assumed you would.

17:05.107 --> 17:09.570
Now that I'm actually about to go out
with penny, I'm not excited, I'm nauseous.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.531
Then your meal choice is appropriate.

17:11.697 --> 17:12.782
Starch absorbs fluid...

17:12.949 --> 17:16.577
Which reduces the amount
of vomit available for violent expulsion.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.622
- Right.
- You also made a grammatical mistake.

17:19.789 --> 17:22.208
You said "nauseous"
when you meant "nauseated."

17:23.459 --> 17:24.877
But go on.

17:25.461 --> 17:28.130
Sheldon, this date
is probably my one chance with penny.

17:28.297 --> 17:29.632
What happens if I blow it?

17:30.466 --> 17:34.679
Well, if we accept your premise and also
accept the highly improbable assumption...

17:34.845 --> 17:37.431
That penny is the only woman
in the world for you...

17:37.598 --> 17:40.393
We can logically conclude
that the result of blowing it...

17:40.560 --> 17:43.813
Would be that you end up a lonely,
bitter old man with no progeny.

17:43.980 --> 17:46.399
The image of any number
of evil lighthouse keepers...

17:46.566 --> 17:48.901
From scooby—doo cartoons
comes to mind.

17:49.527 --> 17:50.987
You're not helping.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.947
All right, what response on my part...

17:53.114 --> 17:55.408
Would bring this conversation
to a conclusion?

17:55.575 --> 17:58.160
Tell me whether or not
to go through with the date.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.745
Schrodinger's cat.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.957
Wow, that's brilliant.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.751
You sound surprised.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.924
[Speaking in mandarin]

18:27.440 --> 18:29.358
-Hi.

18:29.525 --> 18:32.278
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

18:33.738 --> 18:34.780
You look very nice.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.449
Thank you. So do you.

18:36.866 --> 18:37.950
[Both chuckle]

18:41.203 --> 18:42.788
I made an 8:00 reservation.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.249
Okay, yeah, great. Listen...

18:45.875 --> 18:47.335
Maybe we should talk first.

18:49.545 --> 18:50.713
Okay.

18:52.214 --> 18:56.052
But before you say anything,
have you ever heard of schrodinger's cat?

18:58.220 --> 19:02.141
Actually, I've heard
far too much about schrodinger's cat.

19:10.566 --> 19:13.319
All right, the cat's alive.
Let's go to dinner.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.534
[Speaking in mandarin]

19:26.707 --> 19:28.793
[In English]
Crazy man. Call the police.
