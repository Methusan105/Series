WEBVTT

00:02.007 --> 00:03.007
Previously on Dexter...

00:03.133 --> 00:04.216
This child is happening.

00:04.342 --> 00:09.471
(Dexter) I'm going to have a child.
But I can't be a father to it. Can I?

00:09.597 --> 00:10.723
The Oscar Prado case?

00:10.849 --> 00:15.310
Fuckers are on the career-maker of the year.
Nail this Freebo and they're golden.

00:15.437 --> 00:17.521
This time he killed a senior ADA's brother.

00:17.647 --> 00:20.649
(Dexter) Except he didn't kill Oscar. I did.

00:20.775 --> 00:22.568
- What do you have on Freebo, Maria?
- Ramon.

00:22.694 --> 00:26.405
- Well, we're working on some new angles.
- Which means you've got shit.

00:26.531 --> 00:29.199
This doesn't look good, Javier.
I think you fucked a girl who's now dead.

00:29.325 --> 00:31.493
All right, look. I passed her to a friend

00:31.619 --> 00:33.412
- who could feed her habit...
- A friend?

00:33.538 --> 00:37.041
- Yeah, a white guy named Freebo.
- Freebo?

00:37.167 --> 00:39.126
(Batista) Why do you think
Freebo's still in town?

00:39.252 --> 00:42.838
Because I think he killed his girlfriend
on Sunday. Jane Doe.

00:42.964 --> 00:44.923
(Batista) Wasn't Jane Doe
missing a patch of skin?

00:45.050 --> 00:47.551
(LaGuerta) Freebo's still out there killing.
We got to catch him fast.

00:47.677 --> 00:49.094
(Batista) Yeah, but we got a lead now.

00:49.220 --> 00:51.930
(Dexter) This department is
becoming annoyingly effective.

00:52.057 --> 00:54.725
Anton is my contact.

00:54.851 --> 00:59.146
- If you wear him out or blow his cover...
- I know how to work a CI, Quinn.

00:59.272 --> 01:03.025
So unless there's some other reason
you don't want me to talk to him...

01:03.151 --> 01:04.860
I can get you a shield tomorrow.

01:04.986 --> 01:11.116
- Will you get me a shield for being a rat?
- No. For being an honest cop, Debra.

01:11.242 --> 01:13.285
Like your father.

01:13.411 --> 01:17.164
I know all about the Chicky Hines case.
He was a big one for the prosecutor.

01:17.290 --> 01:19.792
- And guess who that was?
- Shit.

01:19.918 --> 01:21.627
(LaGuerta) Miguel Prado.

01:21.753 --> 01:25.380
(Dexter) M-6 bayonet.
Oscar tried to kill Freebo with it.

01:25.507 --> 01:28.050
It's only fitting I use it to complete the task.

01:33.139 --> 01:34.848
It was self-defense.

01:39.104 --> 01:40.896
Thank you.

01:41.731 --> 01:43.023
You're welcome.

03:45.063 --> 03:48.982
(Dexter) The grocery store. The modern-day
equivalent of the Serengeti,

03:49.108 --> 03:51.318
where the mighty lion goes to hunt.

03:53.571 --> 03:56.531
And my weaker brethren
reward me with gifts.

03:57.575 --> 03:59.243
Hmm!

04:00.411 --> 04:02.663
We'll be needing a lot of those pretty soon.

04:02.789 --> 04:05.749
The lioness, of course,
has her own agenda.

04:06.876 --> 04:10.045
- (Cody) What's next?
- Uh...

04:10.171 --> 04:12.673
Macaroni & Cheese. Mayonnaise.

04:14.842 --> 04:17.970
You do your grocery list alphabetically?

04:18.096 --> 04:20.013
How else would you do it?

04:22.350 --> 04:23.600
Got it.

04:23.726 --> 04:27.646
Mmm! The rare and elusive White Cheddar.
Very good choice.

04:27.772 --> 04:29.982
Let's go find some muffins.

04:30.108 --> 04:34.111
(Man) What you wanna be? A painter?
(Astor) I don't know... (Giggles)

04:34.237 --> 04:37.406
I bet you're a good drawer. A sculptor...

04:37.532 --> 04:42.286
My highly tuned senses detect another
predator sniffing around one of my cubs.

04:42.412 --> 04:44.037
- D'you get the mayo?
- Yep.

04:51.504 --> 04:53.422
He wanted to know where the Cheerios are.

04:54.841 --> 04:57.217
Aisle three. Other side of the store.

04:57.343 --> 04:59.720
Oh... Thanks.

05:07.603 --> 05:09.730
All right. What's next?

05:09.856 --> 05:11.148
Zucchini.

05:41.137 --> 05:42.846
Just in case.

05:51.230 --> 05:52.522
FQ.

05:54.859 --> 05:56.360
Forensics Quarterly.

05:59.697 --> 06:03.700
Forensics Quarterly.
With an article written by yours truly.

06:03.826 --> 06:06.453
(Clears throat) Good stuff. Very sexy.

06:06.579 --> 06:12.042
"Simultaneous quantification
of autosomal and Y-chromosomal DNA"?

06:12.168 --> 06:17.089
Yeah, I autographed it but if you want me
to write something personal, let me know.

06:17.215 --> 06:18.882
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

06:23.638 --> 06:26.098
No match on her prints.
No missing persons report.

06:26.224 --> 06:28.809
- So Jane Doe...
- Is still Jane Doe.

06:28.935 --> 06:30.268
And Freebo?

06:30.395 --> 06:32.270
Same thing, nothing.

06:38.069 --> 06:42.280
Sugar is so much better
than the artificial stuff. Don't you think?

06:42.407 --> 06:43.907
Well, I guess.

06:44.033 --> 06:47.619
- Do you like milk or cream?
- Neither.

06:47.745 --> 06:50.789
- Not exactly the chatty type, are you?
- No.

06:50.915 --> 06:52.582
(Lift bell)

06:55.962 --> 06:59.423
Quinn, Morgan.
Man the phones. Man the streets.

06:59.549 --> 07:03.135
Someone out there's seen Freebo
and we haven't found him yet. Let's go.

07:03.261 --> 07:08.140
Miguel Prado - the only living person
who's seen me with blood on my hands.

07:08.266 --> 07:09.641
- Miguel.
- Maria.

07:09.767 --> 07:12.018
Hey. How are you holding up?

07:12.145 --> 07:16.815
(Sighs) I can't lie. I'm missing
my little brother every minute of every day.

07:16.941 --> 07:21.528
Well, it'll get easier.
It's a cliché but it's true.

07:21.654 --> 07:26.158
I want to thank you for making
Dexter Morgan available to me. He, uh...

07:26.284 --> 07:31.163
He went to great trouble
to help me...understand...

07:31.289 --> 07:33.498
how Oscar's last moments unfolded.

07:33.624 --> 07:35.959
Why is he trying so hard
to be my friend?

07:36.085 --> 07:39.087
We're doing everything we can
to find the man who killed Oscar.

07:39.213 --> 07:43.842
I know you are. That's why I feel
like I'm in such a difficult situation.

07:45.178 --> 07:46.303
What is that?

07:46.429 --> 07:50.682
Well, you've dedicated so many
of your resources towards resolving this...

07:50.808 --> 07:52.851
He's trying to end the investigation.

07:52.977 --> 07:56.855
Is it worth it? We both know if you
don't catch a perp in the first 48 hours,

07:56.981 --> 07:59.483
the chances significantly drop
that you ever will.

07:59.609 --> 08:03.528
Miguel, this is not the time to give up
or even slow down.

08:04.655 --> 08:07.866
We will find Fred Bowman.
We'll bring him to justice.

08:07.992 --> 08:09.326
Thank you, Maria.

08:13.539 --> 08:15.832
Psst! Tonight...

08:15.958 --> 08:17.584
Viernes Culturales.

08:17.710 --> 08:21.963
Come by the beach, grab a beer,
uh... medianoche. Right after work.

08:22.089 --> 08:25.217
- You'll be home by eight.
- I don't know if Rita will be up for it.

08:25.343 --> 08:28.845
Syl already talked to her.
She'd love to go.

08:30.014 --> 08:32.140
Then Viernes Culturales it is.

08:38.773 --> 08:41.775
Did he say anything
about the Chicky Hines situation?

08:41.901 --> 08:44.611
I still got a witness in lockup
that says Hines is innocent.

08:44.737 --> 08:46.655
- Miguel is aware of that.
- I know.

08:46.781 --> 08:50.825
I was just wondering when he's finally going
to get around to questioning my witness?

08:50.952 --> 08:54.704
- I assumed he had already.
- Not as of this morning.

08:55.873 --> 08:57.874
Well, I'm sure he'll get to it.

08:59.377 --> 09:01.044
I'll talk to him.

09:02.046 --> 09:05.465
We got a new murder victim.
Dumped in the park just like our Jane Doe.

09:05.591 --> 09:08.718
Some of his skin was sliced off.
Looks like Freebo struck again.

09:08.844 --> 09:13.098
- All right. Let's get there.
- It can't be Freebo. I killed him.

09:15.476 --> 09:17.978
But only Miguel and I know that.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.653
And we're not at liberty to tell.

09:32.076 --> 09:33.660
(Siren)

09:41.210 --> 09:44.337
Javier Garza, he's a lowlife pimp.

09:44.463 --> 09:46.756
He's the one that connected
our Jane Doe to Freebo.

09:46.882 --> 09:49.342
Looks like Freebo paid him back for that.

09:49.468 --> 09:52.178
I can't say for certain
until I get this under the 'scope,

09:52.305 --> 09:55.932
but I'm guessing we're looking
at something like an eight-inch blade,

09:56.058 --> 09:58.101
razor-sharp, single-edged.

09:58.227 --> 10:01.313
Same type of instrument
used on our Jane Doe.

10:01.439 --> 10:02.772
So Freebo killed Javier.

10:02.898 --> 10:04.691
No, he didn't kill Javier.

10:04.817 --> 10:09.112
One of the tree-trimmers called it in, said
he didn't see anything or anyone unusual.

10:09.238 --> 10:10.488
It all points to Freebo.

10:10.615 --> 10:14.492
- He got a little hungry for flesh this time.
- (Debra) What the hell's that about?

10:14.619 --> 10:16.745
Do we think he's eating it?

10:16.871 --> 10:20.874
There's a lot more cannibalism
in this country than any of you realize.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.418
Maybe the skin's like a trophy or something.

10:23.544 --> 10:27.005
Or he just likes to hurt people.
What do you think, Dex?

10:27.131 --> 10:30.550
- They all sound like good theories to me.
- Way to commit.

10:30.676 --> 10:35.013
So far we haven't found shit on Freebo
but now he's giving us a second chance.

10:35.139 --> 10:39.225
So let's not blow it. Quinn, Morgan,
let's get a canvass going. One-block perimeter.

10:39.352 --> 10:42.979
- Start with the tree-trimmers.
- Why don't you take the tree-trimmers?

10:43.105 --> 10:45.940
- I'm going to start over here.
- Oh, gosh. I wonder why.

10:50.988 --> 10:53.740
Hey! Can you come down here?

10:56.494 --> 10:57.869
Sure.

11:01.874 --> 11:04.501
Hi. I'm Detective Joseph Quinn.

11:04.627 --> 11:07.379
There's nothing to worry about here.
Did you guys see anything?

11:07.505 --> 11:09.839
How long have you been out here?
Been out here a while?

11:09.965 --> 11:12.258
- What's your name?
- George Washington King.

11:12.385 --> 11:14.719
- And you called this in?
- Yes, I did.

11:14.845 --> 11:18.056
- You found the body?
- Uh... No, no. Mario did.

11:18.182 --> 11:21.309
- Will you join us, please?
- Ven aquí.

11:22.144 --> 11:24.688
Mario, did you notice anyone else?

11:26.357 --> 11:28.191
Keep my eyes on my work.

11:29.193 --> 11:31.444
I got to go with Freebo on this one.

11:31.570 --> 11:34.739
Means he's stepping out
from wherever he's been hiding.

11:34.865 --> 11:37.242
Not so good for our latest victim
but good for us.

11:37.368 --> 11:38.660
Yeah.

11:39.662 --> 11:40.954
- Yeah.
- Hey, Dex.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.373
Let's grab a beer tonight,
talk about my Jane Doe.

11:44.333 --> 11:46.960
I'd like to help but I have
too much to deal with right now.

11:47.086 --> 11:49.170
What do you have to deal with?

11:49.296 --> 11:50.672
Rita's pregnant.

11:51.841 --> 11:53.758
Say again?

11:54.719 --> 11:56.594
Rita's pregnant.

11:56.721 --> 11:57.971
You're lying!

11:58.723 --> 12:01.015
- I'm not lying.
- A baby?

12:02.393 --> 12:06.604
A motherfucking roly-poly, chubby-cheeked
shit-machine? Are you kidding me?

12:06.731 --> 12:11.526
Well, I've never heard it described
in quite those words before, but yeah.

12:12.611 --> 12:14.446
That's so great!

12:16.532 --> 12:18.658
I'm so happy for you guys.

12:21.412 --> 12:22.954
Well, thank you.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.290
Hmm... Baby on board.

12:25.416 --> 12:27.167
I've got to get on board.

12:28.669 --> 12:31.588
(Rita) Grab a sweater. It'll get cool later.

12:36.302 --> 12:37.594
Mm.

12:40.181 --> 12:41.264
You OK?

12:41.390 --> 12:44.726
I always get my morning sickness
late in the day.

12:44.852 --> 12:47.395
You want to stay home?
We don't have to go.

12:48.314 --> 12:50.940
- No.
- The Prados will understand.

12:51.066 --> 12:56.529
No. I was looking forward to seeing Syl.
I know you love hanging out with Miguel.

12:56.655 --> 12:59.115
Miguel. My new bestest friend.

12:59.241 --> 13:02.994
Besides, the doctor says
the way I'm feeling is fine.

13:05.164 --> 13:06.706
What else did the doctor say?

13:06.832 --> 13:10.335
He asked me a million questions
about my medical history.

13:10.461 --> 13:14.255
There's a form for you to fill out too,
but I told him you were adopted.

13:14.381 --> 13:17.801
I mean...
Are there any details that you do know?

13:17.927 --> 13:21.513
Like "Mom was killed by a chainsaw,
my brother was killed by...

13:21.639 --> 13:23.181
"well, me." That kind of stuff?

13:23.307 --> 13:25.308
No, I don't really know anything.

13:27.478 --> 13:29.312
Well, it's OK.

13:30.439 --> 13:33.942
I could go to the doctor
and get checked out, if you want.

13:35.820 --> 13:38.196
- You'd do that?
- Of course.

13:38.322 --> 13:40.865
I'm glad we're in this together, Dexter.

13:40.991 --> 13:43.034
You'll make a good father.

13:43.160 --> 13:45.036
You know, if you want to.

13:52.002 --> 13:53.962
(♪ Salsa music)

14:04.348 --> 14:07.934
- Here. It'll help settle your stomach.
- Thank you.

14:08.060 --> 14:11.479
- How are you doing with everything else?
- Good.

14:11.605 --> 14:13.690
I feel better about it now.

14:14.942 --> 14:18.361
- Actually kind of excited.
- Good. And Dexter?

14:19.238 --> 14:23.658
Mm. I think he's still
a little overwhelmed by everything.

14:23.784 --> 14:26.077
Ugh! Men, they're such babies.

14:26.203 --> 14:29.956
They need to be carried
kicking and screaming into fatherhood.

14:30.082 --> 14:33.418
I guess they're just scared
about losing their freedom.

14:34.837 --> 14:39.924
Dexter. I don't know if you officially
got to meet my other brother, Ramon.

14:40.050 --> 14:41.926
Beautiful wife, Sara.

14:42.052 --> 14:44.220
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

14:45.222 --> 14:49.058
- Sheriff's department, right?
- That's right.

14:49.184 --> 14:51.978
So you're the guy that Miguel
is always talking about?

14:52.104 --> 14:55.773
- Oh?
- Oh, don't worry. Like they say, it's all good.

14:55.900 --> 14:58.234
Yeah, if good means being part of the team

14:58.360 --> 15:01.529
that's never going to catch
our brother's murderer.

15:01.655 --> 15:05.241
My gracious brother.
We'll grab a beer?

15:09.038 --> 15:11.456
- Gracias, mi amigo.
- Para servir.

15:13.959 --> 15:15.835
Free beer. Must be nice to be you.

15:15.961 --> 15:19.505
A lot of people appreciate
knowing that I'm on their side.

15:22.593 --> 15:24.510
I understand you're soon to be a father.

15:26.805 --> 15:28.723
Yeah.

15:28.849 --> 15:30.892
(Laughs) What?
Some mixed emotions there?

15:32.519 --> 15:34.604
No. It's just...

15:35.898 --> 15:37.023
Yeah, mixed emotions.

15:37.149 --> 15:41.027
I don't know what's more complicated,
having a father or being one but...

15:41.153 --> 15:43.863
it's good to know you're not taking it lightly.

15:44.949 --> 15:48.451
- You'll see your way through it.
- Hope so.

15:49.078 --> 15:51.829
So, uh...our friend Freebo...

15:53.958 --> 15:57.919
...has he come back from the dead
or are the police mistaken?

15:58.045 --> 16:00.338
I'd venture to guess the police are mistaken.

16:00.464 --> 16:02.340
You're positive?

16:03.509 --> 16:04.884
Miguel, he's dead.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.305
I believe you.

16:10.182 --> 16:11.307
Well, good.

16:11.976 --> 16:13.768
You just, uh, seem a little...

16:13.894 --> 16:15.979
Cómo anda, chiquitico?

16:17.856 --> 16:20.692
You seem a little unsettled
with the whole thing.

16:20.818 --> 16:23.611
That's what he's looking for.
A sign that I'm normal.

16:23.737 --> 16:26.823
To be honest,
I haven't been sleeping too well lately.

16:26.949 --> 16:29.242
Just know you did the right thing, my friend.

16:31.829 --> 16:33.997
And it will never be forgotten.

16:40.170 --> 16:43.339
A full day of work,
an evening of socializing,

16:43.465 --> 16:49.595
and now, finally,
the calm, cool aloneness of my apartment.

16:54.309 --> 16:57.478
Hello, Nathan Marten, Cheerios man.

17:07.531 --> 17:09.699
My animal instincts are never wrong.

17:11.076 --> 17:14.078
Hello, Nathan Marten, sexual predator.

17:15.414 --> 17:18.583
You did four years
at South Bay Correctional Facility.

17:19.376 --> 17:22.211
Your official status is "released".

17:22.337 --> 17:25.423
Which leaves you free
to slither about the earth.

17:25.549 --> 17:27.008
(Knocking)

17:29.678 --> 17:31.012
(Sighs)

17:33.307 --> 17:34.599
(Knocking)

17:41.065 --> 17:43.274
- Miguel.
- I went back to my office

17:43.400 --> 17:47.153
to finish up with some paperwork,
and it just...it kept on nagging at me.

17:48.739 --> 17:51.699
¡Coño! What Ramon said to you.
I wanted to apologize.

17:51.825 --> 17:53.534
It's really not necessary.

17:55.079 --> 17:56.871
At least share a drink with me.

17:58.957 --> 18:00.416
Yeah, I'll grab some glasses.

18:01.293 --> 18:05.797
Showing up late at night like this,
is it creepy, or just what friends do?

18:08.926 --> 18:10.635
How 'bout out here?

18:12.596 --> 18:16.641
My father, he caught me drinking
from his bottle of rum when I was, like, 12.

18:16.767 --> 18:20.186
- Yeah.
- He grabbed that bottle, he threw it at me.

18:20.312 --> 18:23.314
Eight stitches,
right in the back of my head right there.

18:23.440 --> 18:24.774
Ouch.

18:25.275 --> 18:27.985
He was a college professor back in Cuba.

18:28.112 --> 18:31.781
Once he got married
and had a couple of kids, he realized,

18:31.907 --> 18:33.950
time to get away from Castro's world.

18:34.076 --> 18:37.495
So we came over on one of these
old fishing boats. I was, like, five.

18:37.621 --> 18:42.166
Dexter. The boat actually sank
50 yards from the shore!

18:42.292 --> 18:45.795
My mother had to grab Ramon, my father
grabbed me and they swam to the shore.

18:45.921 --> 18:48.589
- Wet foot, dry foot.
- Sounds brave.

18:49.466 --> 18:51.300
Yeah.

18:51.426 --> 18:54.178
Yeah, he was a real hero, my father was.

18:54.304 --> 18:58.766
He spent the rest of his life telling everybody
what a great man he could have been

18:58.892 --> 19:00.560
if it wasn't for Castro.

19:00.686 --> 19:02.728
The more he drank, the greater he became.

19:02.855 --> 19:04.105
Ah.

19:04.982 --> 19:09.527
I would look at him and tell myself,
"I'm not going to be like him."

19:14.992 --> 19:17.118
You succeeded.

19:17.244 --> 19:19.203
Yes, I did.

19:19.329 --> 19:24.000
You know what the funny thing is?
In his eyes, I was a failure.

19:25.294 --> 19:27.253
I could never measure up!

19:31.925 --> 19:34.218
My father was disgusted by me.

19:36.346 --> 19:38.014
Disgusted?

19:38.932 --> 19:42.226
Well, no offence to the dead,
but your father was an idiot.

19:42.352 --> 19:43.603
(Sighs)

19:44.855 --> 19:50.067
Never said that to anyone before.
Not Rita. Not to my sister.

19:50.194 --> 19:53.487
Yeah, yeah, but, Dexter,
they wouldn't understand.

19:53.614 --> 19:58.534
You know? They don't know what it is to be a
man, to be a son. All that fuckin' pressure.

19:59.494 --> 20:03.331
You can grow up and be exactly the man
your father molded you to be, and still...

20:03.457 --> 20:04.916
Not be good enough!

20:05.584 --> 20:07.084
Exactly.

20:15.761 --> 20:18.054
It was even harder on Oscar.

20:20.140 --> 20:23.601
By the time he was born
my father was hardly even around.

20:23.727 --> 20:27.897
I mean, I tried to take care of him,
look after... You know.

20:29.316 --> 20:30.524
I'm sorry.

20:30.651 --> 20:32.068
That I killed him.

20:33.403 --> 20:37.323
To Oscar.

20:47.459 --> 20:49.460
So, Dexter...

20:49.586 --> 20:52.296
I think I have an answer
for our other little problem.

20:53.131 --> 20:57.009
- Oh?
- Yes, I think I got it all figured out.

20:57.135 --> 21:01.973
All we have to do is get Freebo's body,
we dump it, then I can call Ramon,

21:02.099 --> 21:07.603
tell him that I received an anonymous tip
about where Freebo can be found.

21:07.729 --> 21:11.107
That would close the case.
And we can all put it behind us.

21:12.901 --> 21:16.112
- Sorry, it's not possible.
- Of course it is. I'll help.

21:16.238 --> 21:19.407
Miguel, the body is...gone.

21:19.533 --> 21:21.659
I'll get it. Just tell me where it is.

21:21.785 --> 21:25.162
He's not going to give up.
He needs to see something.

21:25.289 --> 21:26.664
I'll take you there.

21:27.958 --> 21:30.293
Tomorrow. Huh? Lunch time.

21:30.836 --> 21:33.296
- OK.
- I'll pick you up.

21:33.964 --> 21:37.967
But look, Dexter, you're not
in this alone, huh? It's you and me.

21:40.721 --> 21:42.388
Together.

21:47.936 --> 21:51.564
That's the problem.
This whole "together" thing.

21:55.193 --> 21:57.570
- Hey, stranger.
- Shit.

21:59.281 --> 22:03.284
It's one thing for you to come to the club,
but don't track me down all over the place.

22:03.410 --> 22:04.535
I called you three times.

22:04.661 --> 22:08.539
If you'd bothered to return those calls,
you could have picked the location.

22:08.665 --> 22:11.292
No, I'm sorry, it doesn't work that way.

22:15.714 --> 22:17.214
Shit!

22:17.341 --> 22:20.176
This is bullshit. What do you want?

22:20.302 --> 22:23.137
(Sighs) Tell me about Javier.

22:23.263 --> 22:25.681
OK, in case you haven't heard, he's dead.

22:25.807 --> 22:30.227
- I have heard. What else do you know?
- You were one of the last to talk to him.

22:30.354 --> 22:33.898
Having a conversation with you
can be dangerous to one's health.

22:34.024 --> 22:37.610
- Who had problems with Javier?
- I don't know.

22:37.736 --> 22:41.155
I'm thinking I shouldn't give you more names
or they might end up dead too.

22:41.281 --> 22:45.451
- You better give me something, Anton!
- I don't like you talking to me that way.

22:45.577 --> 22:49.663
(Laughs) I'm sorry. I didn't realize
you were such a high-class snitch.

22:50.582 --> 22:54.418
No part of me needs this,
so why don't you just let me out of here?

22:54.544 --> 22:56.712
- Not till I get some answers.
- Am I your prisoner?

22:56.838 --> 23:00.424
Look, we have a deal! And I'm
not leaving until I get some information!

23:00.550 --> 23:05.262
- I know what'll make you leave. (Sniffing)
- What the fuck? Get rid of that.

23:05.389 --> 23:10.101
Don't want anyone to know you came to the
men's room with your CI and lit up a joint.

23:10.227 --> 23:13.396
- Fuckin' flush it.
- I can't flush this mama.

23:13.522 --> 23:16.607
(Caribbean accent)
This is premium Island Lady.

23:16.733 --> 23:20.945
- If you light that, I'll arrest you.
- Don't worry, there's more than enough.

23:21.988 --> 23:23.948
I'll share.

23:34.126 --> 23:36.419
I told you not to fucking do it!

23:40.674 --> 23:42.466
(Exhales loudly)

23:46.930 --> 23:50.474
It seems ironic that I,
an expert on human dismemberment,

23:50.600 --> 23:54.228
have to pay $800
to have myself virtually dissected.

24:03.029 --> 24:08.826
Check out this brain. This one belonged
to a serial killer executed last month.

24:08.952 --> 24:10.744
Killed 11 women.

24:10.871 --> 24:12.997
Then he really snapped.

24:13.123 --> 24:16.667
Killed his wife, two kids
and the neighbor's dog.

24:17.502 --> 24:19.420
Why are you showing me this?

24:19.546 --> 24:22.506
Look how much smaller
the right hemisphere is.

24:22.632 --> 24:25.593
This guy sure doesn't process
a lot of emotions, huh?

24:25.719 --> 24:28.387
And you see all this activity
in the subcortex region?

24:28.513 --> 24:32.141
That's where feelings of aggression
and violence come from.

24:32.267 --> 24:34.727
- Why are you...
- Because, look.

24:36.646 --> 24:39.565
It's exactly the same as your brain, Dex.

24:51.411 --> 24:53.787
(Dexter) Freebo's final resting place.

24:55.499 --> 24:56.499
How?

25:00.045 --> 25:04.340
They dig the graves the day before,
they place a tarp over each one.

25:04.466 --> 25:07.885
It wasn't that hard
to bring Freebo here late at night,

25:08.011 --> 25:12.515
find an open grave to place his body in
and then to cover it up with a foot of dirt.

25:12.641 --> 25:18.437
Then the next day they lower a 500-pound
casket on top of him, cover it all up with dirt.

25:18.563 --> 25:21.148
Hiding a body in a cemetery.
You're fucking brilliant.

25:24.027 --> 25:26.862
I'll just get a judge
to issue an exhumation order now,

25:26.988 --> 25:29.198
- and then we...
- I need you to not do that.

25:29.783 --> 25:33.744
I've never done this before. I don't
know what evidence I left on the body.

25:33.870 --> 25:36.705
Hair and fibers...
I can't have it traced back to me.

25:37.374 --> 25:39.333
Fair enough, fair enough.

25:42.295 --> 25:45.923
It does leave us with our next little problem.

25:46.049 --> 25:47.258
What is that?

25:47.384 --> 25:51.262
Well, we still have someone out there
skinning and killing people.

25:51.388 --> 25:54.181
- Yes, we do.
- Your homicide squad think it's Freebo.

25:54.307 --> 25:57.560
They're wasting time and energy
looking for a dead man, when...

25:58.687 --> 26:02.022
the real killer, whoever that might be,
is out there walking free.

26:02.148 --> 26:06.694
- Well, how's that our problem?
- Because justice isn't being served.

26:06.820 --> 26:08.654
Of course, of course.

26:08.780 --> 26:12.658
We have to steer the police
in the right direction.

26:12.784 --> 26:16.579
- How do we do this?
- (Scoffs) I don't have a fucking clue.

26:17.956 --> 26:21.709
But I've a feeling you're not going to
leave me alone until we figure this out.

26:21.835 --> 26:23.252
Together.

26:24.254 --> 26:26.255
What do you think about cowboys?

26:27.424 --> 26:28.841
Uh...

26:30.093 --> 26:32.386
Rugged American heroes?

26:33.847 --> 26:36.599
- No, I meant for the baby's room.
- Oh.

26:37.851 --> 26:38.892
Nice.

26:40.103 --> 26:42.521
We can do something different if you want.

26:43.356 --> 26:46.108
Yeah, cowboys are...fine.

26:56.161 --> 26:58.704
Hey, are you ready to go to that yoga class?

26:59.581 --> 27:01.206
Sure.

27:01.333 --> 27:03.917
Astor! Cody! Come on, let's go.

27:08.006 --> 27:09.423
(Camera clicking)

27:19.934 --> 27:21.810
Nathan Marten.

27:23.521 --> 27:26.982
As the sun begins to set,
the lowly scavengers reveal themselves.

27:28.777 --> 27:30.444
Hey, it's the Cheerios man.

27:32.405 --> 27:35.199
- Who?
- The guy from the grocery store.

27:37.327 --> 27:41.121
- What guy?
- The man who talked to me. Dexter knows.

27:43.333 --> 27:44.375
Who is he?

27:46.836 --> 27:48.504
He's no one to be concerned about.

27:50.632 --> 27:54.802
Because in a land of predators,
a lion never fears the jackal.

27:59.849 --> 28:03.894
And here we go into another warrior pose.

28:04.020 --> 28:06.063
Feel your hips open up.

28:07.357 --> 28:10.109
We are strong warriors.
All of us.

28:10.235 --> 28:14.154
This is absolutely, without a doubt,
the worst moment of my life.

28:14.280 --> 28:19.368
Now let's go into a little freeform yoga.
Just let yourself dance.

28:20.954 --> 28:22.871
I was wrong. This is.

28:22.997 --> 28:25.958
See the dust dancing against the sunlight.

28:28.461 --> 28:33.382
Be as beautiful
as the golden flakes of dust, Dexter.

28:35.301 --> 28:38.512
I could probably kill her
before anyone realized what happened.

28:38.638 --> 28:41.348
(Breathes deeply) Excellent.

28:41.474 --> 28:46.145
Now I want all the partners
to turn and face their pregnant women.

28:46.271 --> 28:48.897
Take your hand and place it on her belly.

28:50.692 --> 28:56.071
And I want you to send all of your
positive intentions to your unborn baby.

28:58.074 --> 29:01.326
I'm sorry.
I just don't want to hurt you.

29:18.720 --> 29:20.429
(Woman) Good morning, Mr. Prado.

29:20.555 --> 29:23.390
Are you satisfied
with the sentencing of Chicky Hines?

29:23.516 --> 29:27.853
I am. I pushed for the maximum
on this case, and I got it, and for just cause.

29:27.979 --> 29:30.981
With Mr. Hines behind bars
for a very long time,

29:31.107 --> 29:35.694
I'm hoping that the families of his victims
can finally find some peace. Thank you.

29:36.738 --> 29:38.781
- Miguel.
- Maria.

29:38.907 --> 29:43.368
- Another win for our team, huh?
- I have to admit, I'm a little confused.

29:43.495 --> 29:45.287
What happened
with the witness I gave you?

29:45.413 --> 29:48.165
I thought he had information
that exonerated Chicky Hines?

29:48.291 --> 29:51.251
I reviewed his statement,
it just didn't add up.

29:52.962 --> 29:55.923
I thought it at least merited
a conversation with him.

29:58.384 --> 30:01.094
I see this kind of stuff all the time.
I know you do too.

30:01.221 --> 30:05.474
Scumbags trying to play the system,
doing whatever they can to stay out of jail.

30:08.978 --> 30:11.104
Um... Trust me on this one, hmm?

30:11.231 --> 30:13.524
(Woman)
Ms. Wolf, do you have a statement?

30:13.650 --> 30:17.236
I imagine Assistant District Attorney Prado
is going to go home now,

30:17.362 --> 30:23.200
strip down to his American flag underwear
and pour himself a nice crime-fighting drink,

30:23.326 --> 30:27.371
make a few fundraising phone calls
for his upcoming run for DA,

30:27.497 --> 30:32.835
but the truth is, he just sent
an innocent man to prison for 20 years.

30:34.087 --> 30:38.215
Ugh! He should be ashamed of himself.
It's despicable.

30:45.723 --> 30:48.433
- Someone's gotta know who she is.
- No luck?

30:48.560 --> 30:52.020
I'm thinking of putting
her picture on milk cartons.

30:53.690 --> 30:57.192
- Not a bad idea.
- Except nobody would ever drink milk again.

31:03.241 --> 31:07.786
- Why the fuck did you lock up my CI?
- Why do you keep calling him your CI?

31:09.205 --> 31:12.040
Is there something you're not telling us?

31:13.376 --> 31:16.086
You're very curious about me, aren't you?

31:16.212 --> 31:18.005
Look at you, changing the subject.

31:19.549 --> 31:24.219
Hey, Sarge. Um, can you ask
Officer Morgan why my CI's in lockup?

31:27.891 --> 31:30.142
He was antagonistic.
He produced a joint.

31:30.268 --> 31:33.145
I warned him not to light it
or I'd have to bust him.

31:33.271 --> 31:38.150
He lit it. I knew I couldn't back down or
he'd never have to cooperate with me again.

31:38.276 --> 31:39.985
He practically arrested himself.

31:41.613 --> 31:43.655
That makes sense to me.
Got a problem with that?

31:43.781 --> 31:45.741
- No.
- Good.

31:50.830 --> 31:52.831
Cut him loose.

32:17.732 --> 32:21.985
- Do I know you?
- We met at the grocery store the other day.

32:23.571 --> 32:25.072
I don't recall.

32:26.032 --> 32:29.159
You asked my girlfriend's daughter
to help you find the Cheerios.

32:29.285 --> 32:31.078
Oh. Right, right, right.

32:31.788 --> 32:34.081
- So what can I do for you?
- Shut the fuck up, Nathan.

32:36.125 --> 32:38.251
- Stay away from my kids.
- What?

32:38.378 --> 32:41.046
(Chuckles) Sorry, buddy,
you got the wrong idea.

32:41.172 --> 32:44.341
Saw you at the beach yesterday
with your camera.

32:44.467 --> 32:47.678
I'm a photographer.
I always have a camera with me.

32:47.804 --> 32:49.680
(Whispers) I know who you are.

32:50.682 --> 32:52.641
I know what you are.

32:53.559 --> 32:54.768
Once.

32:55.770 --> 32:59.064
Once I made a horrible mistake
and I paid the price for it.

32:59.190 --> 33:01.483
I did my time.

33:01.609 --> 33:04.361
But I'm not like that any more.

33:04.487 --> 33:08.031
I learned my lesson.
I've changed.

33:08.157 --> 33:10.909
You haven't changed.
It's impossible.

33:13.454 --> 33:15.497
We are what we are.

33:22.588 --> 33:26.758
Night. Good for the hunter.
Bad for the hunted.

33:28.136 --> 33:32.472
Nathan Marten,
is your past the prologue to your future?

33:33.599 --> 33:35.726
From the outside, he looks normal.

33:35.852 --> 33:40.230
But like me, his brain is flawed and he
has a compulsion he's unable to control.

33:40.356 --> 33:42.983
We're really not so different,
Nathan and I.

33:43.109 --> 33:45.777
Except that I would never hurt a child.

33:45.903 --> 33:49.072
Then again,
Nathan has never killed anyone.

33:49.198 --> 33:51.116
Which means he doesn't fit my code.

33:52.702 --> 33:55.787
I have other problems to deal with
besides Nathan.

34:05.923 --> 34:07.424
(Cellphone ringing)

34:08.301 --> 34:09.634
Miguel Prado...

34:11.471 --> 34:12.929
(Phone continues ringing)

34:16.225 --> 34:18.351
...and Teegan Campbell.

34:18.478 --> 34:21.563
If I take care of one,
I take care of the other.

34:25.485 --> 34:27.402
It's a new day in Miami.

34:27.528 --> 34:30.280
Perfect time to help Deb help herself.

34:30.406 --> 34:32.991
One of the things
that makes my sister a good cop

34:33.117 --> 34:35.535
is that she's like a dog with a bone.

34:35.661 --> 34:38.789
Once she's got her teeth into something,
she'll never let go.

34:38.915 --> 34:41.083
All I have to do is lead her to the bone.

34:46.422 --> 34:48.090
Hey, Papa!

34:48.216 --> 34:50.008
Oh, hi.

34:50.134 --> 34:52.260
Oh, God. Almost forgot.

34:54.972 --> 34:58.266
- Isn't it great?
- Nice.

34:59.811 --> 35:01.603
Have you started thinking about names?

35:01.729 --> 35:03.688
Not that I want to push it on you,

35:03.815 --> 35:07.109
but if you have a girl,
Debra's a really good name.

35:08.111 --> 35:10.862
- Deb, I should tell you...
- My God. What happened?

35:10.988 --> 35:12.531
Nothing happened.

35:12.657 --> 35:16.952
It's just I'm not sure
I'm going to be there to raise the baby.

35:18.579 --> 35:19.830
What?

35:19.956 --> 35:22.874
I don't know if I'm going
to be a father to the kid.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.292
Ow!

35:24.418 --> 35:26.378
Of course you are, you moron.

35:26.504 --> 35:27.879
- Deb...
- Shut the fuck up!

35:28.005 --> 35:31.091
How could you even say
you're not going to be a father to that kid?

35:31.217 --> 35:36.138
I mean, where would you be without Harry?
And he wasn't even your biological father.

35:37.473 --> 35:40.684
I just think I'm gonna be a lousy father.
I don't want to screw the kid up.

35:40.810 --> 35:44.229
- Would you please stop doing that?
- Then stop saying stupid things!

35:47.483 --> 35:51.736
I mean, first of all, who are we kidding?
You're gonna be a great father.

35:51.863 --> 35:56.408
And second, and much more important,
big dumb brother of mine...

35:57.410 --> 35:59.327
this isn't about you.

36:02.999 --> 36:05.000
Who's it about?

36:06.919 --> 36:08.044
The baby.

36:09.380 --> 36:11.840
So it doesn't matter how scared you are,

36:11.966 --> 36:15.552
how reluctant or unprepared you might feel,
the baby comes first.

36:15.678 --> 36:17.262
And that baby needs you.

36:19.473 --> 36:22.142
So you're just going
to have to set aside all...

36:24.020 --> 36:26.605
Holy shit. That's my Jane Doe.

36:26.731 --> 36:29.065
It's about time.

36:29.192 --> 36:32.611
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, that's her. Teegan Campbell.

36:32.737 --> 36:36.323
- It looks like her.
- Yeah, I gotta go, Dex. This is big.

36:39.243 --> 36:42.495
- What's that for?
- I know you, Dex.

36:43.706 --> 36:47.083
You're the best brother in the world,
and you can do this.

36:47.210 --> 36:50.754
And if you don't trust yourself, trust me.

36:50.880 --> 36:52.631
I'm the smart one in the family.

37:10.650 --> 37:12.901
They look motivated.

37:13.486 --> 37:16.613
- (LaGuerta) Anything?
- Claro. Once Morgan found out

37:16.739 --> 37:20.283
that Jane Doe was Teegan Campbell,
it was a quick step to find her apartment.

37:20.409 --> 37:23.370
- Guess who'd been hiding out there?
- Freebo. His shit was everywhere.

37:23.496 --> 37:26.081
- All kinds of fresh fingerprint evidence.
- That's good.

37:26.207 --> 37:29.167
Fucking guy's got an airtight alibi.
We checked the call logs.

37:29.293 --> 37:33.129
Freebo called Abby Wilson 4 hours before
the estimated time of Teegan's murder.

37:33.256 --> 37:35.006
- We followed up with Abby.
- But get this.

37:35.132 --> 37:37.217
She's saying she spent
all day in bed with Freebo.

37:37.343 --> 37:40.053
If that theory holds,
that means Freebo didn't kill Teegan.

37:40.179 --> 37:44.307
And there are several calls from this phone
to Teegan's cell after she was killed.

37:44.433 --> 37:47.602
Assuming Freebo made those calls,
he may not even know that she's dead.

37:47.728 --> 37:50.313
We know Javier was killed
by the same person who killed Teegan,

37:50.439 --> 37:51.982
so he's off the hook for that as well.

37:52.108 --> 37:54.734
I was just telling Miguel
how we weren't giving up on Freebo.

37:54.860 --> 37:57.821
Now I have to call him
and tell him he's probably right?

37:57.947 --> 38:00.490
Freebo's probably long gone?

38:00.616 --> 38:03.159
- Looks that way.
- (Sighs) ¡Ay!

38:06.247 --> 38:09.666
- What is that?
- Oh... Uh...

38:09.792 --> 38:13.920
- You stuck a piece of chewing gum on it?
- I'm sorry.

38:14.046 --> 38:17.799
This is a deliberate insult
against me and my people!

38:17.925 --> 38:20.802
- Come on! Come on!
- Ass-wipe.

38:22.972 --> 38:25.515
- Who the fuck are his people?
- I don't know.

38:25.641 --> 38:28.435
- Little scientists, I guess.
- (Quinn laughs)

38:29.770 --> 38:32.480
The lieutenant's right.
We're starting all over here.

38:32.606 --> 38:35.358
We need to get out there
and see what we can shake loose.

38:35.484 --> 38:37.360
We're looking at two cases now.

38:37.486 --> 38:41.323
Ramos, liaison with tri-state PD
on the Freebo situation.

38:41.449 --> 38:43.867
Quinn, Morgan, you stay on the Skinner.

38:43.993 --> 38:46.453
And you need to mend fences with that CI.

38:46.579 --> 38:50.373
He's part of that world. We need
all the help we can get on this. OK?

38:50.499 --> 38:52.917
- Mm-hm.
- (Chuckling)

38:57.506 --> 38:58.965
Hey!

38:59.091 --> 39:01.593
Lucky break, huh?
Seeing that flyer?

39:01.719 --> 39:03.845
You make your own luck.

39:09.518 --> 39:12.228
And now that I've dealt with Teegan...

39:12.355 --> 39:13.772
(Cellphone rings)

39:15.441 --> 39:18.360
- Yep?
- Hi, it's Dexter. Good news.

39:19.445 --> 39:21.529
I was going to call you.
We need to meet.

39:23.366 --> 39:24.407
Uh... OK.

39:24.533 --> 39:27.827
Today, right after work.
Under the bridge near the beach club.

39:29.914 --> 39:31.498
(Sighs)

39:40.716 --> 39:42.467
Hey, Dexter.

39:42.593 --> 39:43.802
Miguel.

39:44.887 --> 39:47.222
So you said on the phone
we have good news.

39:47.348 --> 39:48.640
Yes.

39:48.766 --> 39:52.644
It was just the other day
that I was stressing the importance

39:52.770 --> 39:56.606
of getting the police off of the Freebo trail.

39:56.732 --> 40:02.862
And today, suddenly, I get the word
that the police have done exactly that.

40:05.574 --> 40:09.327
I don't know how you did it, Dexter,
but I'm impressed.

40:09.453 --> 40:11.913
Actually, it wasn't me at all.
It was my sister, Debra.

40:13.416 --> 40:16.668
You're a little uneasy with compliments,
aren't you?

40:17.753 --> 40:19.504
We all need to be liked.

40:20.256 --> 40:24.134
I also notice that you always
have your guard up around me.

40:25.511 --> 40:27.137
Oh, that's not true.

40:27.930 --> 40:29.139
Ah, it's OK.

40:29.265 --> 40:33.601
Actually, it's a good thing.
I appreciate that you're a cautious man.

40:35.020 --> 40:39.274
It's actually a very valuable trait to have,
especially considering our circumstances.

40:39.400 --> 40:40.984
It's just my nature.

40:41.902 --> 40:44.446
I just want you to know,
you don't have to worry about me.

40:44.572 --> 40:46.030
We're on the same side here.

40:48.659 --> 40:51.578
Honestly, I try to avoid
taking sides in most situations.

40:51.704 --> 40:54.497
There you go again, always being careful.

40:54.623 --> 40:55.832
(Chuckles)

40:55.958 --> 40:58.376
OK. Come on.

40:59.336 --> 41:02.088
- I got a gift for you.
- (Car lock beeps)

41:02.214 --> 41:03.715
A gift?

41:06.260 --> 41:08.887
You know, when you took care of
my brother's murderer...

41:09.972 --> 41:12.140
you gave me, uh, peace.

41:12.266 --> 41:14.142
Now let me give you peace.

41:18.355 --> 41:19.481
A shirt?

41:19.607 --> 41:24.986
The shirt. This is the shirt I was wearing
when Freebo met his end.

41:31.869 --> 41:33.745
That's his blood, right there.

41:35.164 --> 41:39.083
This shirt implicates me in his death.

41:39.210 --> 41:41.336
Accessory after the fact.

41:43.005 --> 41:46.299
- Why?
- Because I trust you.

41:46.425 --> 41:48.301
I trust you.

41:50.846 --> 41:52.805
And I want you to trust me.

41:56.435 --> 41:57.852
Same question. Why?

41:59.146 --> 42:00.855
Because I like you.

42:02.274 --> 42:04.692
I like working with you.

42:10.282 --> 42:12.575
You're a good man, Dexter Morgan.

42:14.078 --> 42:18.122
Potencial.
You got a lot of potential in you.

42:21.710 --> 42:25.463
Sometimes I think that you are
the only one who doesn't know that.

42:25.589 --> 42:29.467
So I'm gonna be seeing you again soon.
All right?

42:30.844 --> 42:32.303
Yep. OK.

42:35.766 --> 42:41.062
Is it possible I've actually made a friend?
Someone I can trust with my dark secrets?

42:41.188 --> 42:44.524
Or am I being foolish
for even asking myself these questions?

42:44.650 --> 42:46.067
(♪ Reggae)

42:52.908 --> 42:54.659
Hey.

42:54.785 --> 42:58.871
- Hey, if you've come to arrest me, I'm clean.
- I don't even have my cuffs.

42:58.998 --> 43:01.708
Look...Anton...

43:01.834 --> 43:03.293
I feel...

43:04.461 --> 43:06.921
not good about what happened.

43:07.548 --> 43:09.132
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

43:09.258 --> 43:12.969
- Came on a little strong, didn't you?
- You kinda pushed me into it, didn't you?

43:13.929 --> 43:15.930
Yeah, OK. I'll admit that.

43:18.392 --> 43:21.227
All right, so, um...I feel...

43:21.353 --> 43:22.895
not good too.

43:24.690 --> 43:26.107
(Laughs) OK.

43:27.693 --> 43:30.278
I've even been working on a song for you.

43:31.030 --> 43:32.155
Kind of an apology.

43:33.115 --> 43:35.533
- No fucking way!
- Yeah, yeah. Um...

43:35.659 --> 43:36.951
It's, uh...

43:37.620 --> 43:39.287
It's not done yet.

43:41.790 --> 43:43.249
(Cellphone ringing)

43:45.669 --> 43:46.836
Hey, you.

43:46.962 --> 43:51.299
Hey, Dexter. I was wondering
if you were coming by later tonight.

43:51.425 --> 43:55.386
If I do, it'll be pretty late.
I've got some work stuff I gotta take care of.

43:55.512 --> 43:59.515
Well, you think you could get a chance
to pick up some milk for the kids?

43:59.642 --> 44:01.559
For their cereal in the morning.

44:03.062 --> 44:04.646
I'll try to remember.

45:04.623 --> 45:10.086
(Dexter) So here I am again. Drawn to the
house of a man who doesn't meet the code.

45:27.896 --> 45:30.189
But maybe there's another code.

45:31.900 --> 45:36.946
A code that says,
"You've stepped uninvited into my world."

45:40.784 --> 45:43.995
And that's a place
where I decide who gets to live...

45:44.121 --> 45:45.621
and who doesn't.

45:46.540 --> 45:47.832
(Gagging)

45:48.751 --> 45:51.627
I am not like you!

45:55.466 --> 45:56.924
(Marten gasps)

45:59.636 --> 46:00.970
(Gasping stops)

46:08.687 --> 46:10.855
Nobody hurts my children.

46:20.699 --> 46:21.991
(Drops body)

46:42.471 --> 46:43.846
It's milk.

46:44.932 --> 46:46.307
Thank you.

46:47.810 --> 46:49.101
You're welcome.

46:53.816 --> 46:57.193
- (Sighs)
- So how was your day?

47:00.030 --> 47:02.156
Um... Long.

47:03.242 --> 47:06.577
- You?
- It was good.

47:09.081 --> 47:11.541
Yeah, mine was good too.

47:12.459 --> 47:16.379
Took care of some stuff...I needed to do.

47:20.342 --> 47:22.802
Mm. That always feels nice.

47:39.069 --> 47:42.905
Just sending out
my positive intentions to our baby.

48:00.090 --> 48:05.595
So there it is.
I'm going to be a father, and raise my child.

48:06.930 --> 48:09.140
It's what any good man would do.

48:09.975 --> 48:11.434
After all...

48:13.270 --> 48:16.063
it's a jungle out there.
