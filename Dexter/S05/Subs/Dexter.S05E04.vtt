WEBVTT

00:11.600 --> 00:13.893
Previously on Dexter...

00:14.019 --> 00:15.395
I think I may have a lead on Kyle Butler.

00:15.521 --> 00:18.356
I didn't know you people were working this.
The Mitchells are in a safe house.

00:18.482 --> 00:19.732
I just want to show them a photo.

00:19.858 --> 00:22.777
There is a great, big,
shit-ugly world out there, Jonah.

00:22.903 --> 00:24.612
What do you want me to do?

00:24.738 --> 00:27.281
- OK, we had sex.
- Was it good sex?

00:27.408 --> 00:29.325
I've said all I'm going to say.

00:31.286 --> 00:32.829
Lopez collapsed while on duty today.

00:32.955 --> 00:34.455
He's been hospitalized
with internal bleeding.

00:34.581 --> 00:38.084
Batista could not only lose his job,
he could serve time.

00:38.585 --> 00:40.962
I know who purchased
the Santa Muerte icons.

00:41.088 --> 00:43.214
- What'd you get?
- Two guys in their 30s.

00:43.340 --> 00:46.384
Strong accents, possibly
recent immigrants from Venezuela.

00:46.969 --> 00:49.846
They did this to him
because he started talking to me.

00:50.389 --> 00:53.182
Boyd Fowler,
Division of Dead Animal Pickup.

00:53.308 --> 00:55.518
Hobbies -
storing women in formaldehyde.

00:55.644 --> 00:57.019
We'll do a shift together.

00:57.146 --> 00:58.813
Tomorrow morning, eight sharp.

00:58.939 --> 01:02.316
An old tourist welcome centre.
Totally isolated.

01:04.737 --> 01:06.863
I wish you could see
the room I set up for you.

01:06.989 --> 01:09.073
All the women you've killed.

01:09.199 --> 01:11.200
You don't know what you're getting into.

01:19.334 --> 01:20.251
Don't!

01:20.377 --> 01:22.503
She saw everything.

01:22.629 --> 01:24.338
She saw... me.

01:26.005 --> 01:32.079
FaceTime with British Models 24/7
www. saucytime. com

03:49.359 --> 03:51.652
I'm not liking the trend here.

03:52.613 --> 03:54.572
You rip a man apart
in a public bathroom...

03:54.698 --> 03:56.782
No one saw.

03:56.909 --> 03:58.993
You nearly botch Boyd's kill.

04:00.704 --> 04:02.580
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Yeah.

04:02.706 --> 04:04.999
And now you've got her.

04:05.125 --> 04:07.418
What's the first rule of the code?

04:08.503 --> 04:09.921
Never kill an innocent.

04:10.047 --> 04:11.672
Don't get caught.

04:13.759 --> 04:16.052
So what's your plan here?

04:16.178 --> 04:18.846
Nurse her back to health
so she can go to the police?

04:18.972 --> 04:21.849
She gives the cops enough to track
you down, then everything falls apart.

04:21.975 --> 04:24.727
Harrison grows up visiting you
on death row.

04:32.277 --> 04:34.737
Why are you doing this?

04:34.863 --> 04:35.947
Because she's dying.

04:36.073 --> 04:37.990
And you're a serial killer.

04:38.116 --> 04:40.242
I'd think you could handle that.

04:40.369 --> 04:44.747
You didn't do this to her, Dex.
She's not your responsibility.

04:45.374 --> 04:47.750
Go home and take care of your son.

05:02.099 --> 05:04.850
It's OK. Don't move.

05:09.439 --> 05:11.607
Everything will be OK.

05:14.569 --> 05:17.029
Don't! It's OK.
It's OK!

05:18.865 --> 05:20.241
Calm down.

05:20.867 --> 05:22.326
Stop fighting me.

05:24.246 --> 05:27.164
I'm not here to hurt you. Stop!

06:00.032 --> 06:02.950
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

06:16.631 --> 06:19.800
- What?
- Jesus. What's your problem?

06:19.926 --> 06:21.218
Sorry. It's the middle of the night.

06:21.344 --> 06:23.095
In California, maybe.
What's wrong with you?

06:23.221 --> 06:25.598
Nothing. I'm just... tired.

06:25.724 --> 06:27.183
You are?

06:27.309 --> 06:29.185
I just pulled an all-nighter
at a crime scene.

06:29.311 --> 06:31.187
Totally fried and I've got jack shit.

06:31.313 --> 06:33.814
So the babysitter's been there all night?

06:33.940 --> 06:35.858
Masuka's trying.
He really is.

06:35.984 --> 06:39.945
But the blood just doesn't talk to him
the way it does to you.

06:40.072 --> 06:41.739
I really need your help on this.

06:41.865 --> 06:45.868
- It's not a good time. I've got Harrison.
- What happened to the babysitter?

06:45.994 --> 06:47.578
Probably getting ready to kill me.

06:47.704 --> 06:49.330
Look, I know you're still on leave,

06:49.456 --> 06:52.249
and you know I wouldn't ask
if it weren't important. Don't make me beg.

06:52.375 --> 06:55.044
Deb, look, it's...

06:55.170 --> 06:59.256
Maybe I can use the crime scene
to get an ID on sleeping beauty here.

06:59.966 --> 07:02.885
- OK, I'll do it.
- You will?

07:03.887 --> 07:09.016
Yeah. Of course.
You're my sister.

07:09.142 --> 07:11.852
Where, uh...
Where should I go?

07:11.978 --> 07:14.980
1132 Moredo. It's a botánica.

07:15.107 --> 07:18.400
Just follow the fucking news vans.

07:19.152 --> 07:21.153
You're the best, you know that?

07:23.198 --> 07:24.365
Hello?

07:52.310 --> 07:54.311
Dex, over here.

07:56.815 --> 07:59.859
You're just in time, the coroner's
chomping at the bit to remove the body.

07:59.985 --> 08:02.820
- It's a bit of a circus.
- You kidding me? It's Barnum and Bailey.

08:04.489 --> 08:06.282
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're working on it!

08:06.408 --> 08:07.950
- What's he saying?
- I have no idea.

08:08.076 --> 08:11.120
But the general complaint is there are fewer
beheadings in the rich parts of Miami.

08:11.246 --> 08:12.246
Beheadings?

08:13.665 --> 08:16.292
Yeah.
And that's not even the fucked-up part.

08:20.422 --> 08:23.424
- Dextrous.
- Vince.

08:25.177 --> 08:27.970
Whoa. You weren't kidding
about the fucked-up part.

08:28.096 --> 08:31.473
It was a potential witness.
And it's the second this week.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.225
So what you got?

08:33.351 --> 08:35.769
Uh, we're thinking, uh, machete.

08:35.896 --> 08:39.690
- OK. What else?
- Just machete.

08:39.816 --> 08:41.734
We've been up all night.
We're too tired to think.

08:41.860 --> 08:43.861
That's why I called you.

08:47.115 --> 08:48.532
So?

08:49.409 --> 08:52.494
So the beheading obviously
went down here.

08:53.747 --> 08:55.956
He was standing.

08:56.082 --> 09:00.544
Whack one,
and the victim goes down.

09:00.670 --> 09:01.670
Whack two.

09:02.923 --> 09:04.506
Whack three.

09:05.467 --> 09:08.010
And cervical vertebrae
are pretty much toast.

09:08.136 --> 09:10.054
Separation complete.

09:11.139 --> 09:13.265
- We have lift-off.
- That's what I've been saying.

09:13.391 --> 09:15.184
Not really. Let him work.

09:15.310 --> 09:18.354
- Eyes and tongue removed here.
- That tongue's in the ice chest.

09:18.480 --> 09:22.107
- Do you want to see it?
- No, not really.

09:22.234 --> 09:26.111
- Has anyone been smoking in here?
- It's 2010. Who smokes?

09:26.238 --> 09:28.781
Uh... Machete man, I think.

09:36.164 --> 09:39.583
A small cigar.
Highly unstable ash.

09:40.418 --> 09:42.795
Short, torn tobacco leaves.
It's a cheap one.

09:42.921 --> 09:45.089
Like a Tiparillo.

09:47.092 --> 09:48.425
I'd look for that.

09:48.551 --> 09:52.471
So machete and Tiparillo.

09:52.597 --> 09:55.015
- Definitely styling.
- Fuck me in both ears.

09:56.101 --> 09:59.687
OK, people, our killers left
through that door into the alley.

09:59.813 --> 10:01.855
So let's sweep it for small cigar butts.

10:01.982 --> 10:03.440
Watch your step, fellas.

10:03.566 --> 10:04.858
Watch the ev.
Watch the ev!

10:04.985 --> 10:07.528
Thank you. Watch the ev.

10:11.908 --> 10:13.492
So...

10:13.618 --> 10:16.412
that, uh, cigar ash stuff...

10:16.538 --> 10:19.373
- Yeah?
- You learn that in grad school?

10:19.499 --> 10:23.419
- Uh, Havana Room.
- Havana Room.

10:25.714 --> 10:28.173
Oh, good to have you back.

10:28.300 --> 10:30.551
You know, in a supporting role.

10:32.053 --> 10:35.347
- Assisting... me.
- Yeah. Thanks.

10:35.473 --> 10:36.765
I got to go.

10:36.891 --> 10:38.809
Don't you want to see
if we find the cigar?

10:38.935 --> 10:42.771
I just want to find out who that girl is
before the M99 wears off.

10:42.897 --> 10:44.106
Absolutely.

10:44.232 --> 10:46.483
I'll drop by the station later.

10:56.119 --> 10:59.455
Well... he's up.

11:00.415 --> 11:02.666
He's been up for hours.

11:04.002 --> 11:06.378
I know. I missed you too.

11:07.172 --> 11:08.756
I'm so sorry.
I know I'm late.

11:08.882 --> 11:12.301
Late doesn't quite capture it.
It's been all night.

11:12.427 --> 11:13.927
I know, it's just...

11:14.054 --> 11:16.847
I killed a man in front of a witness
I just had to tranquilise

11:16.973 --> 11:19.475
to keep her
from scratching my eyes out.

11:19.601 --> 11:21.685
- What?
- I'll make it up to you.

11:21.811 --> 11:24.480
- I don't think so.
- What's that mean?

11:25.148 --> 11:27.816
It means I don't think this is a good fit
and I won't be returning.

11:27.942 --> 11:30.486
It is. It is a good fit.
Harrison likes you.

11:30.612 --> 11:34.865
And I really like him, which is what pains me
so much about this, but...

11:34.991 --> 11:38.327
He needs a reliable parent.
Especially with his mother gone.

11:38.453 --> 11:41.705
- I'm reliable.
- Well, I guess we use different dictionaries.

11:41.831 --> 11:43.999
- It will never happen again.
- Do you think?

11:44.667 --> 11:46.627
My mother told me
when I was just a little girl,

11:46.753 --> 11:51.840
"Never lie to someone who trusts you.
Never trust someone who lies to you."

11:51.966 --> 11:53.509
It's a shame, really.

11:54.302 --> 11:56.637
We got off to such a good start.

12:02.477 --> 12:04.186
I miss your mom.

12:09.901 --> 12:11.860
I understand that,
but the bureau said no.

12:11.986 --> 12:15.989
Even though the only clue
you have in the Trinity case is Kyle Butler,

12:16.116 --> 12:17.699
and I might know who that is.

12:17.826 --> 12:18.742
That's right.

12:18.868 --> 12:20.744
- Ask again, Ray.
- There's no point.

12:21.830 --> 12:22.830
I thought you had clout.

12:22.956 --> 12:26.792
Not when it comes to doing an end run
on safe house procedures.

12:26.918 --> 12:30.712
Look, offer still stands.
Give me the photo, I'll show it to the family.

12:30.839 --> 12:34.049
I told you, I can't do that.
It's a sensitive situation.

12:34.175 --> 12:37.553
- It's your call.
- Great. Thanks.

12:43.810 --> 12:45.310
Here we go.

13:07.500 --> 13:11.295
There's the safe house,
and there's Jonah Mitchell.

13:18.261 --> 13:20.929
OK, we may have
finally caught a break

13:21.055 --> 13:23.140
in the Santa Muerte case,
so listen up, people.

13:23.266 --> 13:24.433
Detective Morgan.

13:24.559 --> 13:28.687
OK, it's too soon to celebrate,
and most of us are too fucking tired anyway,

13:28.813 --> 13:30.898
but we found this just outside

13:31.024 --> 13:33.775
the back entrance of the botánica
where Fauzi was murdered.

13:35.737 --> 13:37.946
- Is that a cigar butt?
- Very perceptive, Detective Quinn.

13:38.072 --> 13:42.826
And may I thank you for getting your lazy ass
off the couch and joining us. So thank you.

13:42.952 --> 13:45.037
It's a Tiparillo butt,
and we have reason to believe

13:45.163 --> 13:47.498
it was handled
by one of the two assailants.

13:47.624 --> 13:50.959
- So what are we talking about, DNA swab?
- Even better.

13:52.212 --> 13:55.464
Oh. Uh...
There's a 3/4 partial thumbprint on the side,

13:55.590 --> 13:57.925
and it has to be processed manually.
It's incomplete.

13:58.051 --> 14:00.552
But we expect to hear back within a day.

14:01.888 --> 14:05.891
And there's the man we have to thank for it -
my nephew, Harrison.

14:06.017 --> 14:07.809
He lent us his dad.

14:08.520 --> 14:11.230
- Look at those cheeks! May I?
- Sure.

14:11.356 --> 14:14.107
- Oh! ¡Qué lindo!
- Gordito.

14:15.151 --> 14:18.362
- You look like your mommy.
- Oh, and he's got daddy's eyes.

14:18.488 --> 14:21.657
- And your penis size.
- No, it's bigger. It's much bigger.

14:26.329 --> 14:28.455
Who would have thought?
Better than doughnuts.

14:33.503 --> 14:37.548
Is this your idea of quality time,
using your son as cover?

14:37.674 --> 14:41.093
He's enjoying it. They're enjoying it.
It's a win-win.

14:41.219 --> 14:43.011
Besides, it's for a good cause.

14:43.137 --> 14:46.848
I need to find out who this girl is
before she wakes up.

14:46.975 --> 14:48.684
Which will be soon.

14:52.230 --> 14:53.981
Damn it.

14:57.235 --> 14:59.319
Come on, come on.

15:12.542 --> 15:16.378
What are you doing now?
Stealing from a co-worker?

15:16.504 --> 15:17.921
Borrowing.

15:18.047 --> 15:21.800
You really think Vince Masuka won't notice
half his medicine cabinet is missing?

15:21.926 --> 15:24.386
I don't care.
He's a hypochondriac.

15:24.512 --> 15:26.513
She actually needs this stuff.

15:36.816 --> 15:39.901
Lumen Ann Pierce, from Minnesota.

15:40.403 --> 15:42.904
No warrants.
Not even a traffic violation.

15:43.031 --> 15:45.657
Yeah, and no missing persons report either.

15:45.783 --> 15:47.367
No one's looking for her.

15:47.493 --> 15:50.621
- What are you saying? I should let her die?
- You can't just let her go.

15:55.043 --> 15:57.002
This isn't some fairy tale
where she wakes up

15:57.128 --> 15:59.338
and you get to be the handsome prince
who saved her.

15:59.464 --> 16:01.089
If she wakes up, she'll call the police.

16:01.215 --> 16:03.008
You think I don't know that?

16:05.887 --> 16:07.262
How you doing?

16:26.157 --> 16:29.451
- Hey, isn't it about time for his nap?
- Yeah.

16:29.577 --> 16:31.703
I know the feeling.

16:31.829 --> 16:35.540
You do? I flatlined hours ago.
I'm heading home to take a nap.

16:35.667 --> 16:38.377
Hey, will you do me a favour
and take him with you?

16:38.503 --> 16:40.462
I've got someone expecting me.

16:40.588 --> 16:43.715
- What about the nanny?
- She needed a break.

16:43.841 --> 16:44.883
After two days?

16:45.009 --> 16:48.720
It would be a huge help.
And he's gonna go right to sleep.

16:48.846 --> 16:51.807
He's way overdue for a nap.

16:51.933 --> 16:55.560
All right. If you carry him to the car.
He's getting heavy.

16:57.438 --> 16:58.897
Angel.

17:03.111 --> 17:05.612
- What's this?
- An address.

17:05.738 --> 17:07.489
I didn't want to give it to you
in front of everybody else.

17:07.615 --> 17:08.740
It's a hospital.

17:08.866 --> 17:12.202
That's where Sergeant Lopez ended up
after your little fight.

17:12.328 --> 17:14.621
- You need to go apologise.
- No. No.

17:14.747 --> 17:16.081
No.

17:16.207 --> 17:17.708
He's the one that should
apologise to me.

17:17.834 --> 17:22.546
He's the one who has a broken nose,
a broken rib, and a punctured lung.

17:22.672 --> 17:23.588
Angel, porfavor...

17:23.715 --> 17:25.966
I should have broken his jaw
for what he said about you.

17:26.092 --> 17:27.801
I'm not going to argue with you.

17:27.927 --> 17:31.513
Internal Affairs is coming by tomorrow,
and they need to know that it's over.

17:31.639 --> 17:35.016
That there's no bad blood
between you, OK?

17:36.894 --> 17:38.895
I'm not asking.

17:54.787 --> 17:57.289
Sorry if I scared you before.

17:59.751 --> 18:02.502
Maybe we can start again?

18:07.967 --> 18:11.011
You probably have a headache.
The sedative does that.

18:11.137 --> 18:16.641
I got you aspirin for it.
Also antibiotics.

18:16.768 --> 18:20.312
You have a pretty serious fever.
They'll help bring that down.

18:21.105 --> 18:23.732
I'm not trying to drug you.
They really are just antibiotics.

18:27.987 --> 18:29.362
See?

18:39.040 --> 18:41.875
You're dehydrated.
Can you drink?

18:46.464 --> 18:48.465
Careful, careful, careful.

18:50.426 --> 18:52.427
I'm not gonna hurt you.

18:55.765 --> 18:57.390
Where am I?

18:58.851 --> 19:02.771
A safe place.
Far from Boyd.

19:04.148 --> 19:07.818
I'm... not taking anything.

19:14.575 --> 19:15.867
What's your name?

19:20.665 --> 19:23.250
Look, you really need to talk to me.

19:27.171 --> 19:30.006
- Rachel.
- OK.

19:32.134 --> 19:33.802
Rachel...

19:35.888 --> 19:38.348
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I just want to see you get better.

19:41.686 --> 19:44.145
Why didn't you take me to the hospital?

19:44.981 --> 19:46.565
You know why.

19:46.691 --> 19:49.442
No, I don't.

19:49.569 --> 19:52.028
Because you saw me...

19:53.781 --> 19:55.448
in the house.

19:59.370 --> 20:00.871
I didn't see anything.

20:00.997 --> 20:03.582
We both know that's not true.

20:05.001 --> 20:07.002
I would never tell anyone.

20:08.713 --> 20:09.963
Please...

20:11.173 --> 20:13.216
let me go.
- I can't.

20:19.473 --> 20:21.474
What are you gonna do with me?

20:23.352 --> 20:25.145
Nothing.

20:26.272 --> 20:28.815
Are you gonna sell me?

20:29.775 --> 20:31.026
Sell you? No.

20:34.071 --> 20:36.740
- Then what are you gonna do?
- Nothing. I'm not gonna do anything.

20:36.866 --> 20:38.491
I'm not lying.

20:38.618 --> 20:42.078
Look, you can't even think straight
with a fever like that.

20:43.289 --> 20:44.873
You need to take these.

20:55.343 --> 20:56.593
- No, no.
- Stay away from me!

20:56.719 --> 20:58.178
I'm trying to help you!

20:58.304 --> 21:00.889
- Let me out! Let me out!
- I can't do that!

21:01.849 --> 21:05.143
No! Please! Let me go!
I can't! I can't!

21:05.269 --> 21:07.228
I can't go through it again!

21:07.355 --> 21:10.941
Just... kill me now!

21:11.067 --> 21:13.735
Please!

21:17.114 --> 21:21.034
Harry's right. I need a plan.

21:36.926 --> 21:40.512
- How you doing, Lopez?
- How's it look like I'm doing?

21:40.638 --> 21:42.639
Listen, the other night...

21:43.474 --> 21:46.101
we both had a little too much to drink...

21:46.227 --> 21:47.519
and, um...

21:49.271 --> 21:51.481
when you insulted my wife...

21:51.607 --> 21:53.149
I just saw red.

21:54.610 --> 21:56.194
I'm sorry.

21:59.365 --> 22:01.783
I'm not the first guy to take a swing at you.

22:01.909 --> 22:05.620
Are you really gonna bust my chops
with IA over this?

22:09.166 --> 22:12.293
You know that line between a few
and a few too many?

22:12.420 --> 22:13.712
All too well.

22:13.838 --> 22:16.798
Yeah, well,
I had way too many that night.

22:16.924 --> 22:19.551
And I should have held my temper,
but I didn't.

22:20.553 --> 22:22.637
And I apologise. Lo siento.

22:24.181 --> 22:26.933
I don't know what else to say.

22:28.644 --> 22:30.395
So are we OK or what?

22:30.521 --> 22:32.814
You're OK.

22:34.316 --> 22:36.359
I'm in a fucking hospital.

22:42.908 --> 22:46.161
No. We're OK.

22:46.287 --> 22:48.705
I'm not gonna press charges, Batista.

22:48.831 --> 22:50.582
Now get the fuck out of my room.

23:01.052 --> 23:03.720
The babysitter doesn't trust me
because of the lies.

23:03.846 --> 23:06.431
Lumen doesn't trust me
because of the truth.

23:09.894 --> 23:11.686
There must be a name for that.

23:12.521 --> 23:14.147
Oh, right - Dexter Morgan.

23:15.941 --> 23:18.443
The problem is Lumen knows
way too much about me

23:18.569 --> 23:21.237
and I know nothing about her.

23:21.363 --> 23:24.032
Hm. An unpaid motel bill.

23:24.158 --> 23:26.743
I was hoping for more,
but at least it's a place to start.

23:29.914 --> 23:34.084
- Hey, how was your nap?
- What nap?

23:34.210 --> 23:37.504
- He woke up the second we got back.
- Oh. Sorry.

23:37.630 --> 23:39.631
Fix you something to eat?

23:40.466 --> 23:42.425
I'm too tired to chew.

23:42.551 --> 23:45.553
- Damn it, Dexter!
- What? What is it?

23:45.679 --> 23:47.263
Nothing. It's just...

23:50.101 --> 23:51.601
What is this?

23:52.812 --> 23:54.187
It's a little toy keyboard.

23:54.313 --> 23:58.399
No, I mean, why am I sitting on it?
Why are we living like this?

23:59.568 --> 24:02.112
Between the baby stuff
and your stuff and my stuff -

24:02.238 --> 24:06.282
which I can barely see anymore -
I feel like a fucking refugee.

24:06.408 --> 24:08.993
I get it. I get it. OK.

24:11.956 --> 24:14.207
You need some peace and quiet.

24:16.210 --> 24:19.045
- We'll head out for a while.
- Where are you going?

24:59.378 --> 25:01.838
- So what can I do for you?
- I'm not sure.

25:01.964 --> 25:04.841
I think my wife, his mom...

25:04.967 --> 25:08.553
might have left her luggage here,
Lumen Pierce.

25:08.679 --> 25:11.181
Let's have a look-see.
Can you spell that, please?

25:11.307 --> 25:13.975
Yeah, it's P-l-E-R-C-E.

25:14.101 --> 25:17.645
The other name.
The weird one. No offence.

25:17.771 --> 25:20.648
Lumen.
L-U-M-E-N.

25:23.152 --> 25:24.652
Mm-hm.

25:24.778 --> 25:26.321
I remember her.

25:26.447 --> 25:29.616
Your wife prepaid two weeks.
It's been over a month.

25:29.742 --> 25:32.869
Yeah, change of plans. We ended up
staying with friends in North Beach.

25:32.995 --> 25:34.579
Well, she never checked out.

25:34.705 --> 25:37.874
We sent her file to a collection agency.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.419
Gee, it'd be a lot simpler
if you'd just let me take care of it.

25:41.545 --> 25:43.546
Do you, by any chance,
still have her luggage?

25:43.672 --> 25:45.632
Yeah, in storage.

25:45.758 --> 25:48.384
I'd appreciate it. We both would.

25:48.510 --> 25:50.220
Three-twenty and we're square.

25:52.097 --> 25:53.473
OK.

25:58.354 --> 26:02.106
Put your John Hancock here,
and I'll go fetch your wife's luggage.

26:02.233 --> 26:03.900
Great.

26:06.654 --> 26:09.280
Ten months' old
and you've had your first cigarette.

26:09.406 --> 26:11.157
Sorry about that.

26:33.597 --> 26:35.640
"Dear Lumen...

26:35.766 --> 26:40.436
"I know it feels like the end of the world
right now, but it's not.

26:42.439 --> 26:45.233
"I understand
why you felt you had to leave.

26:45.359 --> 26:49.070
"And believe me,
you have nothing to be ashamed of.

26:49.822 --> 26:51.698
"And as for your father,

26:51.824 --> 26:54.075
"I know he said things he regrets,

26:54.201 --> 26:55.827
"even though he'll never admit it.

26:58.789 --> 27:00.832
"We miss you. We love you.

27:00.958 --> 27:04.669
"Take all the time you need,
but then please come home.

27:04.795 --> 27:08.423
"It's not a family without you.
Loνe Mom."

27:29.028 --> 27:30.862
Dexter.

27:32.114 --> 27:35.616
Sorry. I woke you up.
I was trying to be quiet.

27:39.872 --> 27:42.540
You were gone a long time.
I was worried about you.

27:42.666 --> 27:45.126
Just went for a little drive.

27:45.252 --> 27:47.170
Sorry about before.

27:48.672 --> 27:51.049
And in case you didn't know,

27:51.175 --> 27:54.260
you and Harrison are
the most important people to me.

27:54.386 --> 27:56.929
You're the only important people.

27:57.056 --> 28:01.351
You guys can stay here forever.
I don't care about the mess.

28:01.477 --> 28:03.770
I'm the fucking slob in the family anyway.

28:07.608 --> 28:10.526
- You want a beer?
- Yeah.

28:12.279 --> 28:14.280
I would love a beer.

28:35.219 --> 28:36.803
Mr Morgan.

28:38.889 --> 28:40.139
Please give us another chance.

28:40.265 --> 28:44.060
- I don't think it's a good idea.
- I know I screwed up.

28:44.186 --> 28:46.854
There's no need to apologise.
Harrison is a wonderful child,

28:46.980 --> 28:49.857
and you will have no trouble
finding someone else to watch him.

28:49.983 --> 28:52.318
I don't want someone else to watch him.
- Well, I'm flattered...

28:52.444 --> 28:56.322
And I heard you -
about how you need to be able to trust me.

28:57.491 --> 29:00.201
What I said was I don't trust you.

29:07.918 --> 29:09.919
Look, there was an emergency.

29:10.838 --> 29:14.215
A girl was badly hurt.
She was very near death.

29:14.341 --> 29:15.842
I spent the night trying to help her,

29:15.968 --> 29:20.096
and then I was called to a crime scene
by my sister. That's where I was.

29:20.222 --> 29:21.597
Really.

29:22.349 --> 29:27.478
And I'm here now
because we interviewed 30 people,

29:27.604 --> 29:29.605
and you're the one...

29:29.731 --> 29:32.150
who didn't scare me, basically.

29:32.276 --> 29:34.694
You're the only one
I could trust Harrison to.

29:37.406 --> 29:40.700
Well, you are holding him
a little bit like a football.

29:42.327 --> 29:44.162
Now...

29:44.288 --> 29:46.372
what do they call it?

29:46.498 --> 29:47.582
A leap of faith.

29:48.959 --> 29:51.669
I guess it's one on both our parts.

29:51.795 --> 29:55.715
One more chance, Mr Morgan,
but that's it.

29:59.386 --> 30:01.012
Look at this.

30:03.390 --> 30:06.434
- Look at what?
- Notice anything missing?

30:06.560 --> 30:07.685
How would I know?

30:07.811 --> 30:12.315
Somebody's been dipping into my meds,
and methinks me knows who.

30:12.441 --> 30:15.776
Yeah, Dexter was back here
alone yesterday.

30:15.903 --> 30:19.197
- I don't know, maybe it was him.
- No motive, Detective.

30:19.323 --> 30:22.200
You, on the other hand,
have been getting down and dirty

30:22.326 --> 30:25.119
with the hottest potty mouth
in the South.

30:25.245 --> 30:28.247
Now, I appreciate you taking
preventative measures

30:28.373 --> 30:32.293
so as not to pass on whatever sick scurvy
you may carry on to her.

30:32.419 --> 30:33.628
Hm.

30:36.715 --> 30:40.927
I'm willing to share.
All you have to do is ask.

30:41.553 --> 30:44.639
OK, I didn't take your meds.

30:44.765 --> 30:49.519
And I'm not getting
down and dirty with Debra.

30:49.645 --> 30:50.895
OK?

30:54.858 --> 30:57.818
May I just say that I admire your chivalry?

30:57.945 --> 31:00.988
It's a rare man who won't kiss and tell.

31:03.325 --> 31:06.452
Make sure you get
the names and numbers...

31:08.372 --> 31:10.831
- Get back to me when you finish.
- Mm-hm.

31:10.958 --> 31:12.375
Excuse me.

31:14.670 --> 31:16.087
McCourt.

31:17.631 --> 31:21.384
Just wanted to let you know that
I paid Sergeant Lopez a visit yesterday.

31:21.510 --> 31:24.178
- So I heard.
- I apologised, he accepted.

31:24.304 --> 31:25.596
We're Jake. It's all good.

31:25.722 --> 31:27.807
Hey, you put a cop in the hospital.

31:27.933 --> 31:31.352
What happens now
is up to the department, not him.

31:32.187 --> 31:33.729
Meaning what?

31:33.855 --> 31:38.276
Fact is, it's assault and battery
against a fellow officer.

31:38.402 --> 31:41.487
It's a few punches against
a drunken loudmouth.

31:42.781 --> 31:44.699
- Good morning, Jim.
- Lieutenant.

31:44.825 --> 31:47.076
You mean to tell me
you have nothing more important to do

31:47.202 --> 31:48.411
than to investigate a bar fight?

31:48.537 --> 31:50.788
How's the timeline coming
on the Santa Muerte case?

31:50.914 --> 31:52.957
The timeline's just fine.

31:53.083 --> 31:55.876
I'm due upstairs in 20 minutes,
so we should get going.

31:56.003 --> 31:59.505
- Would you like some coffee?
- That would be wonderful.

32:03.552 --> 32:05.886
- My husband's not wrong, you know.
- How's that?

32:06.013 --> 32:08.222
Considering the fact
that the other officer involved...

32:08.348 --> 32:09.932
The assault victim.

32:11.393 --> 32:13.394
It was just a bar fight, Jim.

32:13.520 --> 32:16.856
Now, you and I both know
they happen all the time.

32:18.483 --> 32:24.030
- OK, I'm wondering what can end this.
- See, I'm more interested in what started it.

32:24.156 --> 32:27.575
Because...
according to Sergeant Lopez's deposition,

32:27.701 --> 32:29.785
he said, drunkenly,

32:29.911 --> 32:33.497
that you give the best blowjob in Miami.

32:37.961 --> 32:40.671
Is that part of the official record?

32:41.965 --> 32:43.466
Should it be?

32:53.935 --> 32:56.687
Hey, good news.

32:56.813 --> 33:01.275
Masuka found a match on that partial print
we had from the cigar butt.

33:01.902 --> 33:05.279
Or are you no longer interested
in solving homicides?

33:05.405 --> 33:08.157
- Huh?
- Carlos Fuentes. You're gonna love this.

33:08.283 --> 33:11.535
He's got a brother, Marco.
They live together, and I got the address.

33:11.662 --> 33:13.245
Two of them.

33:13.372 --> 33:14.914
Does that sound like
what we've been looking for,

33:15.040 --> 33:16.707
or does that sound like
what we've been looking for?

33:16.833 --> 33:19.418
I'll get a team together.
Let's get these guys.

33:19.544 --> 33:21.796
Where's Quinn again?
Fucknose is gonna miss the party.

33:21.922 --> 33:24.423
I have no idea. Who knows?

33:31.181 --> 33:32.306
Fuck.

33:49.866 --> 33:52.243
Hold on.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

33:54.705 --> 33:57.623
OK, go. Go, go, go, go.

34:02.421 --> 34:07.508
Morgan, you, you, you,
the other end of the hall. You, upstairs.

34:11.638 --> 34:13.514
- Freeze!
- No, no. We want Fuentes.

34:13.640 --> 34:14.932
Let him go. Let him go.

34:15.058 --> 34:16.308
Go!

34:32.242 --> 34:33.784
Open up. Police.

34:39.040 --> 34:40.541
Police. Policía.

34:43.086 --> 34:45.296
Nobody move.

34:45.422 --> 34:47.047
Holy shit.

34:50.218 --> 34:51.802
We want these guys.

34:51.928 --> 34:54.138
Fuentes. Fuentes.

34:54.264 --> 34:55.556
Fuentes.

35:06.651 --> 35:08.694
No habla.

35:34.387 --> 35:37.389
Cut him and I'll blow your fucking head off.

35:37.516 --> 35:39.517
You hear me?

35:39.643 --> 35:41.018
Let him go.

35:41.144 --> 35:43.729
- You let him go!
- Everybody clear? Report in.

35:43.855 --> 35:45.397
Diaz, clear.

35:45.524 --> 35:47.817
- Manzon, clear.
- Responder.

35:47.943 --> 35:51.278
- Detective Morgan, you clear?
- Responder.

35:54.324 --> 35:55.324
Yes, clear.

35:58.370 --> 35:59.745
You stupid bitch.

36:00.705 --> 36:02.581
Argh! Help!

36:05.544 --> 36:07.336
Medic! I need a fucking medic!

36:37.617 --> 36:39.994
Don't you dare let him die.

36:43.790 --> 36:46.333
- You OK?
- Fine.

36:47.335 --> 36:49.670
Fuck, I should have shot Fuentes
when I had the chance!

36:49.796 --> 36:51.714
- And risk killing that kid?
- He might die anyway.

36:51.840 --> 36:54.717
And he might live, thanks to you.
We nearly caught those fucks.

36:54.843 --> 36:57.303
- You did good.
- You weren't there.

37:03.643 --> 37:06.854
Lumen Ann Pierce, from Minnesota.

37:09.274 --> 37:14.570
If I can get the crotchety judgmental
babysitter from Ireland to trust me...

37:14.696 --> 37:16.322
I say, why not you?

37:33.882 --> 37:35.758
Yah!

38:52.002 --> 38:56.755
Stop! Stop! Help me!
Help! Help me!

38:59.050 --> 39:00.634
Do you need a ride?

39:00.760 --> 39:03.262
Yeah, what are you doing out here?

39:03.388 --> 39:04.888
Hey, where are you going?

39:05.015 --> 39:08.809
Man, she is fucked-up!

39:13.857 --> 39:15.607
No! No!

39:15.734 --> 39:16.942
- No! No!
- Lumen...

39:17.068 --> 39:19.028
- No! No!
- Lumen. Lumen...

39:19.154 --> 39:20.779
Lumen. Lumen.

39:22.741 --> 39:23.949
Would you stop? Stop.

39:24.075 --> 39:25.409
Would you stop!

39:25.535 --> 39:26.952
Shh!

39:57.400 --> 39:59.943
You know how close you came back there?

40:00.070 --> 40:02.946
If she'd gotten in that car,
it would have been all over.

40:04.074 --> 40:05.407
Where are we going?

40:05.533 --> 40:08.077
Believe me, she will never trust you.

40:08.203 --> 40:09.536
Where are you taking me?

40:09.662 --> 40:13.916
First rule of the code - don't get caught.
And you're out of options now.

40:14.042 --> 40:15.959
- Let me go.
- She's left you no choice.

40:16.086 --> 40:17.461
Quiet.

40:47.158 --> 40:48.283
Jonah?

40:48.409 --> 40:50.828
Hey. Don't be afraid.
I'm a cop.

40:50.954 --> 40:53.914
- Miami Metro.
- Do I know you?

40:54.040 --> 40:56.792
I think I know who Kyle Butler is.

40:56.918 --> 40:58.752
Do you recognise this man?

41:02.006 --> 41:04.299
- Why do you want to know?
- Is this Kyle Butler?

41:04.425 --> 41:07.010
- Hey, back away! Back away!
- I'm a cop. It's OK.

41:07.137 --> 41:09.721
Keep your hands where I can
fuckin' see 'em, and shut the hell up.

41:09.848 --> 41:11.849
Jonah, go to the car now.

41:11.975 --> 41:13.142
Turn around.

41:57.562 --> 41:59.813
Come on. Move.

42:01.566 --> 42:04.902
- Please. Don't!
- Just move.

42:06.738 --> 42:08.739
What are you gonna do?

42:19.542 --> 42:21.376
- Look at this.
- No! No!

42:21.502 --> 42:22.961
Look.

42:24.923 --> 42:27.382
This is what happened
to the girls before you.

42:27.508 --> 42:29.676
This is what was gonna happen to you.

42:30.428 --> 42:33.096
Every one of these barrels
has a body in it.

42:34.515 --> 42:37.559
Boyd preserved them in formaldehyde
so he could come and visit.

42:39.103 --> 42:40.604
Do you understand?

42:40.730 --> 42:42.981
I saved your life.

42:45.777 --> 42:50.155
How do I know that
you didn't kill these girls?

42:54.827 --> 42:56.036
You don't.

43:01.459 --> 43:06.129
It's a leap of faith...
for both of us.

43:12.595 --> 43:14.388
My wife was murdered...

43:15.348 --> 43:16.807
brutally...

43:16.933 --> 43:18.517
by someone like Boyd.

43:21.187 --> 43:23.689
I don't want to see any more
innocent people die.

43:27.944 --> 43:30.237
Here, you don't believe me?
Take it.

43:30.363 --> 43:31.780
No.

43:36.411 --> 43:39.037
Take it. It's yours.

43:57.056 --> 43:58.432
Are you done?

44:19.495 --> 44:21.955
I tell you to leave Trinity's family alone,

44:22.081 --> 44:24.833
and instead...
you go behind my back.

44:24.959 --> 44:27.336
And based on what? This?

44:27.462 --> 44:30.213
A cut-and-paste sketch you think
resembles Dexter Morgan?

44:30.340 --> 44:33.550
- The kid recognised him.
- He identified Dexter as Kyle Butler?

44:33.676 --> 44:35.552
He didn't get a chance, but I could tell.

44:35.678 --> 44:40.974
Oh, you could tell.
And did Jonah convey this ID to the FBI?

44:41.100 --> 44:42.434
- No.
- Right.

44:42.560 --> 44:44.603
Because it's bullshit.

44:45.605 --> 44:48.023
You have your suspicions,
you come to me.

44:48.149 --> 44:52.194
- I tried.
- And when I say no, Quinn, it's over!

44:56.199 --> 44:58.658
You're on unpaid suspension
until further notice.

44:58.785 --> 45:00.160
Suspension?

45:00.286 --> 45:02.120
Just tell everyone you're
taking a few vacation days.

45:02.246 --> 45:03.288
You kidding?

45:04.665 --> 45:06.833
Am I fucking kidding?

45:08.002 --> 45:11.546
You're lucky I don't terminate your ass.
And you know the one reason I don't?

45:11.672 --> 45:15.425
Because there'd be a mandatory hearing,
and this whole embarrassment

45:15.551 --> 45:17.094
would become a matter of record.

45:19.514 --> 45:22.099
No one needs to hear
about your stupid theories.

45:22.225 --> 45:24.226
It would tear this department apart.

45:26.562 --> 45:29.147
- Understood?
- Sure.

45:30.733 --> 45:33.318
He just lost his wife,
for Christ's sakes!

45:45.706 --> 45:47.332
Hey, skeezey.

45:48.668 --> 45:50.919
Where you been all day?

45:51.045 --> 45:54.089
Very long, fucked-up story.

45:57.468 --> 46:00.011
I heard about the raid.

46:00.138 --> 46:01.930
Perp got away.

46:02.890 --> 46:05.058
What I heard was
you saved someone's life.

46:10.189 --> 46:14.443
I let you down.
I should've been there to back you up.

46:17.029 --> 46:19.364
- Yeah, you should've.
- Yeah.

46:22.702 --> 46:24.119
You OK?

46:26.956 --> 46:29.416
I guess not, cos everybody
keeps asking me that.

46:33.629 --> 46:35.630
I don't want to be alone tonight.

46:37.341 --> 46:40.260
Deb, I'm...

46:42.054 --> 46:44.431
no good for you.

46:45.933 --> 46:47.976
I'm not looking for good right now.

47:02.408 --> 47:04.117
Is that true?

47:04.243 --> 47:07.162
What you said about your wife?

47:10.333 --> 47:11.416
Yes.

47:17.882 --> 47:20.342
How did it happen?

47:21.719 --> 47:23.678
Knife.

47:32.647 --> 47:34.731
Painful and cruel.

47:41.739 --> 47:44.032
I'm sorry...

47:44.158 --> 47:46.701
that I cut you.

47:48.913 --> 47:52.290
I thought you were a monster, like Boyd.

47:55.545 --> 47:57.629
I thought you were going to kill me.

47:59.549 --> 48:01.174
Or worse.

48:04.762 --> 48:06.888
I was locked up.

48:09.016 --> 48:11.768
I don't know where,
or for how long.

48:14.480 --> 48:17.148
All I know is that it was horrible.

48:20.570 --> 48:24.197
And I thought...
it would never stop.

48:31.497 --> 48:34.499
But it has stopped.
He's dead. It's over.

48:35.459 --> 48:37.043
You can go home.

48:38.170 --> 48:39.963
I don't think so.

48:41.007 --> 48:42.591
You can.

48:46.053 --> 48:48.638
I read your letter.
I know you have a family who loves you.

48:48.764 --> 48:50.765
You should go home to them.

48:53.019 --> 48:54.811
It's not that simple.

48:57.648 --> 48:59.649
It is.

48:59.775 --> 49:01.776
It really is.

49:09.910 --> 49:12.287
Boyd wasn't the only one who did this to me.

49:14.999 --> 49:16.583
There were others.

49:25.801 --> 49:27.969
It's not over.
