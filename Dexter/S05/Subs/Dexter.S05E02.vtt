WEBVTT

00:10.683 --> 00:12.392
Previously on Dexter...

00:14.520 --> 00:17.230
Rita's inside. It was me.

00:17.356 --> 00:20.149
FBI? Fucking Bunch of Idiots.

00:20.275 --> 00:23.152
You want to talk to Dexter,
schedule an appointment.

00:24.196 --> 00:25.780
I'll do that.

00:25.906 --> 00:28.074
If this were anyone but Dexter,

00:28.200 --> 00:30.535
we'd at least be thinking
like detectives.

00:30.661 --> 00:34.372
When the wife is dead,
90% of the time the husband did it.

00:37.334 --> 00:39.127
What are you doing?

00:40.379 --> 00:42.839
You wanna talk about it,
or are you just gonna act weird?

00:42.965 --> 00:44.006
There's nothing to talk about.

00:44.133 --> 00:45.675
All Rita and I ever did was kiss.

00:45.801 --> 00:47.677
Dexter found out
about the indiscretion,

00:47.803 --> 00:50.638
and came over and punched me out.

00:52.266 --> 00:54.350
- Arthur Mitchell.
- Kyle Butler.

00:54.476 --> 00:55.685
And what's his name?

00:55.811 --> 00:57.562
Uh... Kyle Butler.

00:59.148 --> 01:02.108
Something happened to your mom.

01:02.234 --> 01:05.278
She's dead!
And it doesn't even matter to you!

01:05.404 --> 01:06.779
I wish you were dead!

01:06.905 --> 01:09.657
I just got a call from the FBI
about your brother's interview.

01:09.783 --> 01:11.701
- Don't tell me. What'd he say?
- He didn't show.

01:11.827 --> 01:13.411
I don't know where the fuck you are

01:13.537 --> 01:15.496
or why you think you can
fucking run away from the FBI,

01:15.622 --> 01:17.623
but you better get back here...

01:20.544 --> 01:22.336
My wife died, and it was my fault.

01:22.463 --> 01:25.590
Your dead wife can suck my dick.

01:29.720 --> 01:33.222
That's the first human thing
I've seen you do since she died, Dexter.

01:33.348 --> 01:35.433
They're not better off without you.

01:36.643 --> 01:38.936
You're not better off without them.

01:40.189 --> 01:41.981
You need to go back.

01:43.005 --> 01:49.079
FaceTime with British Models 24/7
www. saucytime. com

03:39.766 --> 03:42.977
It's said there are seven stages of grief.

03:46.273 --> 03:49.150
I suppose killing someone
with my bare hands in a men's room

03:49.276 --> 03:51.861
was my way of working through
the anger stage.

03:54.114 --> 03:56.616
Whatever the other six stages are...

04:00.162 --> 04:02.330
I don't have time for them.

04:07.169 --> 04:09.587
Cos now I'm a full-time dad.

04:11.673 --> 04:14.508
Once the kids and I are back together,

04:15.302 --> 04:17.094
it'll all be fine.

04:27.689 --> 04:29.857
I can't believe we're all gonna
squish in here.

04:29.983 --> 04:32.818
It's just temporary,
till we can get a new place.

04:32.945 --> 04:34.695
Here.

04:34.821 --> 04:38.199
He needs to be hosed off
or something.

04:38.325 --> 04:39.825
Hey.

04:39.952 --> 04:41.202
Welcome home.

04:41.328 --> 04:42.954
This isn't our home.

04:43.080 --> 04:45.247
And why do we need a new place, anyway?

04:45.374 --> 04:47.583
I think starting in a new apartment
will be good for us.

04:47.709 --> 04:50.336
Look, I found a place
practically on the beach.

04:50.462 --> 04:52.755
Or another one right next to a park.

04:52.881 --> 04:54.423
But, until then, Astor,

04:54.549 --> 04:56.634
you get to share the bed with me.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.844
And, Dex, you're on the couch.

04:58.971 --> 05:01.931
Cody, you're on the cot.

05:02.933 --> 05:04.392
Time for you both to get to bed -
school tomorrow.

05:04.518 --> 05:06.268
How can I go to school?

05:06.395 --> 05:08.980
I don't even have any of my things.

05:09.773 --> 05:11.691
Make a list.
I'll go by the house tomorrow.

05:11.817 --> 05:13.275
I want to go with you.

05:13.402 --> 05:16.529
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Why?

05:16.655 --> 05:20.282
Well... because of what happened
to your mother there.

05:20.409 --> 05:23.619
I know what happened to my mom.
She was murdered.

05:31.294 --> 05:33.254
Don't forget, 9am tomorrow.

05:33.380 --> 05:35.339
FBI interview.

05:38.093 --> 05:42.346
One final loose end to tie up
before putting all this behind me.

05:47.144 --> 05:50.021
At the time of your wife's death,
you were...

05:50.147 --> 05:52.023
I already told you.
I was on my boat.

05:52.149 --> 05:53.399
Right.

05:53.525 --> 05:55.818
Just seemed odd.

05:55.944 --> 05:57.820
You do a lot of night boating, Mr Morgan?

05:57.946 --> 05:59.321
Sometimes. It's more peaceful.

05:59.448 --> 06:01.699
- And you were by yourself?
- Yes, I was alone.

06:01.825 --> 06:04.827
There are security cameras at the marina.
You can see me leaving and returning.

06:04.953 --> 06:06.203
We've seen the footage, Mr Morgan.

06:06.329 --> 06:08.497
The problem is,
according to the coroner's report,

06:08.623 --> 06:11.125
your wife was killed several hours
before you got on the boat.

06:11.251 --> 06:12.543
Is that what this is about?

06:12.669 --> 06:14.545
Are you fucking serious?

06:14.671 --> 06:19.175
Suggesting I have anything to do
with my wife's death...

06:19.301 --> 06:21.594
that I'd slice her artery,
let her bleed out in the bathroom...

06:21.720 --> 06:25.681
Mr Morgan, we know that you
were at Arthur Mitchell's house.

06:29.603 --> 06:31.270
At the time of your wife's death,

06:31.396 --> 06:34.482
you were part of the team
that raided Arthur Mitchell's house.

06:37.194 --> 06:39.195
Right, of course.

06:39.905 --> 06:41.530
We know you didn't kill your wife.

06:41.656 --> 06:45.701
We're just looking for a reason why
Arthur Mitchell might have targeted her.

06:50.665 --> 06:52.666
Because he's a serial killer?

07:01.301 --> 07:03.302
How'd it go?

07:03.428 --> 07:04.970
Fine.

07:05.097 --> 07:08.140
I'm just glad it's over,
and I can move on.

07:08.266 --> 07:09.642
We miss you, brother.

07:09.768 --> 07:10.976
Yeah?

07:11.103 --> 07:13.354
How's handling the department
all by yourself?

07:13.480 --> 07:15.022
Ah, it's a breeze.

07:15.148 --> 07:17.858
- I'll be back in a few days.
- Oh, no, you won't.

07:17.984 --> 07:21.904
You're taking at least another week.
You need to spend time with your family.

07:22.030 --> 07:23.197
Thanks.

07:23.323 --> 07:24.240
Excuse me.

07:24.366 --> 07:26.492
Anything you need, Dexter, just ask.

07:26.618 --> 07:28.452
I will.

07:29.287 --> 07:30.579
See you tonight.

07:30.705 --> 07:33.040
Oh! Grandparents stopping by too.

07:35.836 --> 07:37.962
They're all staying at your place?

07:38.088 --> 07:41.006
Yeah. It's crowded.

07:41.133 --> 07:43.259
But it's temporary.
He just doesn't want the kids

07:43.385 --> 07:46.220
- staying at the house where their mom...
- Right.

07:46.346 --> 07:48.013
So, we all good here?

07:48.140 --> 07:49.431
Yeah, he's airtight.

07:49.558 --> 07:51.016
But otherwise, we got jack shit.

07:51.143 --> 07:52.518
Arthur Mitchell disappeared.

07:52.644 --> 07:55.187
The only lead we have now
is this Kyle Butler.

07:56.565 --> 07:59.525
We had a murder victim by that name
a few weeks back.

07:59.651 --> 08:01.735
Well, our guy's alive,
as far as we know.

08:01.862 --> 08:03.779
Unfortunately,
he's disappeared as well.

08:03.905 --> 08:07.908
We're gonna have a sketch artist meet
with the family, and get a composite of him.

08:08.034 --> 08:11.287
- I'd appreciate it if you'd keep me posted.
- Will do.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.167
Hey...

08:19.713 --> 08:22.089
Maria, your mail.

08:44.613 --> 08:47.781
So, Dexter Morgan,
let's get you a moving van.

08:47.908 --> 08:49.783
Aren't you a cute kid, huh?

08:49.910 --> 08:53.454
- Huh?
- He's not actually talking yet.

08:53.580 --> 08:56.957
Here's your 18-footer.
What's his name?

08:57.083 --> 08:59.335
- Harrison.
- 14-footer.

08:59.461 --> 09:01.086
It's a family name?

09:06.718 --> 09:08.594
Blood.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.346
Er... Sort of.

09:10.472 --> 09:12.765
So, what kind of stuff you moving?

09:12.891 --> 09:16.227
Just, uh, furniture, clothes,
a dresser, maybe.

09:16.353 --> 09:19.813
Plenty of reasons for blood to be there. Someone cut
himself moνing...

09:19.940 --> 09:24.109
If that's all we're talking about, save yourself
some money, go with the 10-footer.

09:26.363 --> 09:28.822
I can't let myself think about this.

09:28.949 --> 09:31.116
I've just got to move the kids.

09:33.912 --> 09:36.580
Actually, I think I'll go with the 14-footer.

09:36.706 --> 09:38.791
OK, let's, uh, write you up.

10:00.272 --> 10:02.564
We're gonna get a much better place.

10:02.691 --> 10:05.859
What do you think,
closer to the park or the beach?

10:07.195 --> 10:09.989
Hello? Dexter?

10:10.115 --> 10:12.157
No annoying neighbours.

10:13.410 --> 10:17.288
- Hey, Dex. Brought your mail.
- Thanks.

10:26.298 --> 10:28.215
Wow. Look at Harrison.

10:28.341 --> 10:30.718
Boy, he's just getting bigger every day.

10:31.886 --> 10:35.639
Hey, look, Dex, you know,
we haven't had a chance to talk,

10:35.765 --> 10:37.224
but I wanted to let you know

10:37.350 --> 10:40.227
how sorry I am about everything.

10:40.353 --> 10:41.270
Thanks.

10:41.396 --> 10:45.899
- Have they caught the Trinity Killer yet or...
- No.

10:46.026 --> 10:47.860
Man, if I could just get my hands on him.

10:47.986 --> 10:49.570
I can only imagine.

10:49.696 --> 10:51.697
Hey, listen,
I know we've had our differences,

10:51.823 --> 10:53.782
but, you know, I'm a single dad.

10:53.908 --> 10:57.286
- I know the ropes, so if you need any help...
- No, I'm good.

10:57.412 --> 10:58.787
Cos you gotta give up a lot.

10:58.913 --> 11:01.415
I mean, I actually had
a pretty decent career going,

11:01.541 --> 11:03.334
but I had to turn down
some major job offers

11:03.460 --> 11:06.337
so I could just work at home
and just be there for those kids.

11:06.463 --> 11:08.213
Good for you.

11:08.340 --> 11:11.258
I mean, forget about any free time.

11:11.384 --> 11:12.760
Or any life of your own, really.

11:12.886 --> 11:14.720
I mean, you just...
you have to be there.

11:14.846 --> 11:17.681
Right? Every morning. Every evening.
Every weekend.

11:17.807 --> 11:20.559
You ready to do that, Dex, for the kids?

11:23.146 --> 11:26.106
Yes, Elliot, I'm ready to do that.
For the kids.

11:27.067 --> 11:28.859
Whoa, whoa!

11:28.985 --> 11:30.986
- Here, let me...
- No. I got it.

11:31.905 --> 11:35.032
But you know what? It works out.
It really does, you know?

11:35.158 --> 11:38.786
I mean, you have to give up your life and all,
but you know what?

11:38.912 --> 11:42.414
You just... You live for those kids,
and it's satisfying.

11:46.586 --> 11:47.920
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

11:54.511 --> 11:57.096
I'll be a good father.
Everyone makes sacrifices.

11:57.222 --> 11:59.014
I can too.

12:15.657 --> 12:17.491
Focus on the kids.

12:19.411 --> 12:21.829
Wow. I didn't know you were
gonna bring so much.

12:21.955 --> 12:23.914
You can just put that...

12:24.040 --> 12:26.375
- Right there is great.
- I emptied the refrigerator.

12:26.501 --> 12:28.544
Someone left another cake at the door.

12:28.670 --> 12:32.005
I just ate a whole tuna casserole
to make room in the apartment.

12:32.132 --> 12:35.134
Cody, this is a good job for you.
Wanna help me unload the food?

12:35.260 --> 12:36.677
OK.

12:38.805 --> 12:42.349
Wow.
You sure do have a lot of beer, Aunt Deb.

12:45.228 --> 12:46.895
People just keep bringing it.

12:49.149 --> 12:50.649
This is all you brought?

12:52.402 --> 12:54.361
Well, we're a little short on space.

12:54.487 --> 12:57.990
You didn't even bring the right clothes.
This is my reject stuff.

12:58.116 --> 12:59.324
I can't wear any of this to school.

12:59.451 --> 13:02.327
Astor, come on.
No one's gonna notice you.

13:05.874 --> 13:08.834
Honey, would you hold the baby?

13:08.960 --> 13:11.128
- Come here.
- Cody.

13:11.254 --> 13:15.340
Why don't you help us
carry the last load in? Hm?

13:16.426 --> 13:18.677
I like it here. It's like camping.

13:20.346 --> 13:22.097
Exactly.

13:22.223 --> 13:24.057
Boys are easier.

13:33.318 --> 13:35.777
It doesn't matter how much
I loνe my children,

13:35.904 --> 13:38.155
I'm still a creature of the night.

13:46.080 --> 13:48.165
Can't sleep either?

13:51.294 --> 13:53.837
The blood probably means nothing.

13:55.632 --> 13:58.050
Someone cut their finger while moving.

13:59.844 --> 14:03.597
But I won't be able to put it out of my mind
until I know for sure.

14:12.690 --> 14:16.360
Someone did a quick cleanup job
but forgot to wash the door.

14:18.029 --> 14:20.364
Yeah, it's pretty. I know.

14:22.784 --> 14:24.701
But not the story it tells.

14:27.247 --> 14:33.752
Once upon a time, an evil green ogre
left a circular spatter at three feet high,

14:33.878 --> 14:37.047
consistent with blunt-force trauma...

14:37.173 --> 14:40.384
which seems to indicate
the handsome young prince

14:40.510 --> 14:42.594
was hit while on his knees,

14:42.720 --> 14:44.429
at least two or three times.

14:48.226 --> 14:51.144
Or the princess was on her knees.

14:51.271 --> 14:53.272
Small hands.

14:53.398 --> 14:54.815
Female.

15:09.789 --> 15:12.291
I thought the kids were
your number-one responsibility.

15:12.417 --> 15:14.418
- They are.
- But here you are...

15:14.544 --> 15:16.086
in the middle of the night.

15:16.212 --> 15:17.963
It's not that simple.

15:18.089 --> 15:19.590
It never is.

15:20.717 --> 15:22.593
It's like when you get on a plane.

15:22.719 --> 15:24.928
They tell you
if the oxygen masks come down

15:25.054 --> 15:27.764
to put yours on first
before helping the kids.

15:27.890 --> 15:30.726
I have to take care of my own needs too.

15:30.852 --> 15:33.562
Otherwise, I risk spinning out of control.

15:34.606 --> 15:35.856
And that's not good for anyone.

15:35.982 --> 15:39.818
I'm not just saying this for the sake
of the kids, Dex, but for you.

15:39.944 --> 15:42.362
They're not only your responsibility.

15:43.156 --> 15:44.781
They're your salvation.

15:52.540 --> 15:53.999
I have to give him a bottle.

16:12.894 --> 16:14.811
No reason a truck rental agency

16:14.937 --> 16:17.481
would put any serious safeguards
on their records.

16:20.193 --> 16:24.488
The truck was most recently rented
to Boyd Fowler.

16:24.614 --> 16:29.242
Boyd seems to have listed his address
as the Department of Sanitation.

16:29.369 --> 16:30.911
No home address.

16:32.538 --> 16:34.665
Miami-Dade County
Department of Sanitation,

16:34.791 --> 16:37.292
Division of Dead Animal Pickup,

16:37.418 --> 16:39.670
meaning the blood belongs to an animal.

16:44.884 --> 16:47.302
But what about those little handprints?

17:02.860 --> 17:04.569
Two lines.

17:04.696 --> 17:06.196
Human.

17:24.716 --> 17:27.008
Well, well, well.
What do we got here?

17:27.135 --> 17:28.802
Raccoon.

17:30.346 --> 17:32.013
- You call this in?
- Yeah, I did.

17:32.140 --> 17:35.350
I was driving down the road,
and... I saw it.

17:35.476 --> 17:36.852
Kind of creeps me out.

17:36.978 --> 17:39.479
You're probably used to
seeing dead things, though, huh?

17:39.605 --> 17:41.481
Can't say I ever get used to it.

17:41.607 --> 17:44.568
I don't usually come this way, but I'm
in the middle of moving to a new place.

17:44.694 --> 17:46.611
It's a hassle, huh? Moving?

17:46.738 --> 17:48.196
- I wouldn't know.
- No?

17:48.322 --> 17:50.657
Lived in the same house for over 20 years.

17:50.783 --> 17:52.701
So why did you rent a moving van?

17:52.827 --> 17:54.661
Hello there, bandit.

17:57.331 --> 18:00.709
- This don't look right.
- What do you mean?

18:00.835 --> 18:03.837
Usually, you find a dead animal in the road,
it means he was hit by a car.

18:03.963 --> 18:06.506
But there's no tyre marks
or blood on the asphalt.

18:06.632 --> 18:09.301
This raccoon was killed someplace else
and dropped here.

18:09.427 --> 18:11.178
He's CSl-ing me.

18:17.351 --> 18:19.394
He's got defensive wounds on his paws.

18:19.520 --> 18:21.104
Little guy put up quite a struggle.

18:32.658 --> 18:34.534
All righty, then.

18:40.958 --> 18:42.959
He's definitely peculiar.

18:43.085 --> 18:47.130
But I guess the best and brightest
don't typically get into dead animal pickup.

18:56.682 --> 18:57.974
Just so you know, OK?

18:58.100 --> 19:00.101
What do we got?

19:00.228 --> 19:01.978
We got a female victim.

19:02.104 --> 19:04.105
- Part of a female victim.
- Part?

19:04.232 --> 19:06.691
- We got a head.
- Just a head?

19:06.818 --> 19:08.693
Yeah. Decapitation.

19:08.820 --> 19:10.737
Probably some kind of drug killing.

19:10.863 --> 19:12.322
Nice.

19:16.619 --> 19:19.412
Let me ask you a question,
hypothetical.

19:19.539 --> 19:22.040
- Say a newly married person...
- Mm-hm?

19:22.166 --> 19:24.709
accidentally discovers
that his or her new spouse

19:24.836 --> 19:27.003
has a savings account with a lot of money.

19:27.129 --> 19:30.048
Is that something
that one should expect to share?

19:31.092 --> 19:33.009
Fuck, no. That's your money.

19:33.135 --> 19:36.179
You tell the lieutenant
to keep her fuckin' hands off it.

19:38.558 --> 19:40.851
- Take me to the head.
- All right.

19:47.567 --> 19:49.943
She was still alive
when they cut her head off.

19:50.069 --> 19:52.737
Excision of eyes and tongue
was done postmortem.

19:52.864 --> 19:54.281
That's considerate of them.

19:54.407 --> 19:57.617
You were right. It's just a head.

19:58.703 --> 20:00.203
Unless they buried her standing up.

20:04.083 --> 20:05.709
What are you doing?

20:05.835 --> 20:07.919
Just trying to help.
You're looking a little ragged.

20:08.045 --> 20:10.755
I'm exhausted. There are five people
in my tiny apartment.

20:10.882 --> 20:13.884
I shared a bed with Astor last night,
and she kicked me all night long.

20:14.010 --> 20:17.137
You know, you're welcome
to crash at my place, if you want.

20:17.263 --> 20:19.014
No, thanks, Detective.

20:19.140 --> 20:20.473
OK.

20:23.352 --> 20:26.605
- It looks like Santa Muerte.
- What?

20:27.523 --> 20:30.150
Santa Muerte, the cult.
"Saint Death."

20:30.276 --> 20:32.527
Yeah, I know what it is,
but why do you say that?

20:32.653 --> 20:35.697
Well, the missing eyes and tongue
were meant to send a message.

20:35.823 --> 20:38.575
You didn't see anything,
you're not gonna say anything.

20:38.701 --> 20:39.910
Who are you?

20:40.036 --> 20:42.370
Officer Manzon, Cira.

20:42.496 --> 20:45.457
The golden candles mean money.
The icons, I don't know.

20:45.583 --> 20:48.501
There are so many now,
you might need an expert on it.

20:48.628 --> 20:52.005
- And you know all this because...
- It's my neighbourhood.

20:52.131 --> 20:55.675
And if it is Santa Muerte,
they used a machete on her.

20:55.801 --> 20:57.218
OK, well, we'll keep that in mind.

20:57.345 --> 21:00.847
But this park is a local drug hangout,
and drug cartels like to cut heads off,

21:00.973 --> 21:04.059
- so we might follow that lead.
- Of course.

21:04.185 --> 21:05.602
Hey.

21:05.728 --> 21:09.272
We found the body on the other end
of the park, under some bushes, no ID.

21:09.398 --> 21:13.151
Gotta canvass the neighbourhood,
start asking questions.

21:13.277 --> 21:15.195
No one will talk. They're too afraid.

21:15.321 --> 21:17.322
Well, we still ask, Officer.

21:22.703 --> 21:25.080
"Helping Your Children Cope With Grief."

21:27.458 --> 21:29.292
"Grandpa's Gone To Heaven."

21:31.629 --> 21:33.213
"Saying Goodbye To Fluffy."

21:34.298 --> 21:37.092
But nothing on
"Mommy bled out in a bathtub."

21:49.438 --> 21:52.440
Boyd Fowler, you have a prison record.

21:52.566 --> 21:54.442
Assault with a deadly weapon.

21:54.568 --> 21:57.070
18 months at Okeechobee.

22:00.199 --> 22:01.324
You said you lived in a house,

22:01.450 --> 22:04.494
but there are no mortgage records
in your name.

22:05.621 --> 22:07.998
In the same house for over 20 years.

22:10.001 --> 22:13.128
You inherited it...
from your parents...

22:13.254 --> 22:16.214
Rich and Elsie Fowler in Opa-Locka.

22:21.971 --> 22:24.222
Hey. How was your day?

22:24.348 --> 22:27.267
A whole afternoon getting
doors shut in my face.

22:27.393 --> 22:28.810
Sorry.

22:29.395 --> 22:30.895
You?

22:32.690 --> 22:33.606
OK.

22:33.733 --> 22:36.317
We finished LaGuerta's
cacerola de camarones

22:36.444 --> 22:38.028
and Masuka's chocolate lava cake,

22:38.154 --> 22:40.530
and Astor told me she hated living here.

22:41.490 --> 22:43.366
They're both asleep in the bed.

22:44.326 --> 22:46.578
Looking at apartments.

22:46.704 --> 22:48.997
So it's everything as usual.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.252
They're seeing
their grief counsellor tomorrow.

22:54.378 --> 22:56.379
Maybe that'll help.

22:58.007 --> 23:01.426
- Still, even after...
- What?

23:01.552 --> 23:05.430
You're gonna be a single dad
raising three kids.

23:05.556 --> 23:06.890
Gonna be hard.

23:07.933 --> 23:09.601
Rita was a great mom.

23:09.727 --> 23:11.644
There's nothing I can do
to make up for that.

23:11.771 --> 23:13.980
But I'm gonna have to try.

23:16.776 --> 23:19.027
Well, I'll be here.

23:20.321 --> 23:22.322
You can count on me.

23:23.240 --> 23:25.325
The kids'll be OK.

23:32.458 --> 23:35.418
I know that place.
It's near the station.

23:36.504 --> 23:38.505
They have an open house tomorrow.
Maybe I'll check it out for you.

23:38.631 --> 23:40.048
Great.

23:41.550 --> 23:42.967
You want the couch tonight?

23:43.094 --> 23:44.886
No, you take it.

24:15.376 --> 24:16.376
- Hey.
- Hi.

24:16.502 --> 24:17.669
Glad you called.

24:17.795 --> 24:20.421
- Hey, fuck puddle. What are you doing?
- Just giving you a kiss hello.

24:20.548 --> 24:22.132
I came over here to sleep,

24:22.258 --> 24:24.801
not to have your fat little
sausage fingers all over me.

24:29.431 --> 24:31.558
There's no room for me at my own place.

24:31.684 --> 24:34.811
Unless I want to curl up inside
a fuckin' toaster oven.

24:37.606 --> 24:39.691
I'm trying so hard to be a good sister.

24:39.817 --> 24:43.153
Fuck knows,
Dexter's always been the best brother, but...

24:43.279 --> 24:45.613
it is fucking exhausting.

24:45.739 --> 24:46.739
I'm sure.

24:46.866 --> 24:48.283
Well, look...

24:48.409 --> 24:52.328
you're, uh, welcome to stay here
for as long as you want,

24:52.454 --> 24:53.997
whenever you want.

24:54.123 --> 24:57.292
And I promise to keep my
fat little sausage fingers off you.

24:57.418 --> 24:58.835
You better.

24:58.961 --> 25:00.628
- How's your brother?
- You know.

25:00.754 --> 25:03.339
I heard the FBI interview went well.
That must be a load off.

25:03.465 --> 25:05.383
Why would that be a load off?

25:05.509 --> 25:06.634
Nothing. Never mind.

25:06.760 --> 25:09.137
They're looking for someone
named Kyle Butler

25:09.263 --> 25:10.638
who's a friend of Arthur Mitchell's.

25:10.764 --> 25:13.391
They think if they can find him,
then he can lead them to Mitchell.

25:13.517 --> 25:15.518
- But they can't find him?
- Well, not yet.

25:15.644 --> 25:18.271
They're having sketches done.
They're trying to get a positive ID.

25:18.397 --> 25:21.024
Kyle Butler.
Why does that name sound so familiar?

25:21.150 --> 25:23.735
Well, that's the weird thing.
We worked that case, remember?

25:23.861 --> 25:25.069
A dead Kyle Butler.

25:25.196 --> 25:28.031
Right, he got his head smashed in.
Went unsolved.

25:29.867 --> 25:31.910
- Any connection?
- I don't know.

25:32.036 --> 25:35.330
I'm sure the FBI will
find a way to fuck it up.

25:35.456 --> 25:37.790
Will you get the lights?

25:37.917 --> 25:39.918
Yes, ma'am.

25:44.632 --> 25:48.051
What do you want to do for the next batch?
Mickey Mouse? Silver dollar?

25:48.177 --> 25:50.220
- Great big ones?
- Triangles.

25:50.346 --> 25:51.971
A challenge.

25:53.766 --> 25:56.267
Dexter's making triangle pancakes.

25:56.393 --> 25:58.937
Actually, they're more freeform.

25:59.730 --> 26:02.565
- Wanna set the table for us?
- Sure.

26:05.486 --> 26:07.278
They're just blobs.

26:07.404 --> 26:08.738
How dare you?

26:14.912 --> 26:16.120
Triangles.

26:22.795 --> 26:25.255
I counted too many plates.

26:26.757 --> 26:28.549
Mom's not here.

26:28.676 --> 26:30.635
- That's OK.
- No, it's not.

26:30.761 --> 26:33.137
- She should be here.
- I'm sorry.

26:33.264 --> 26:36.307
- That doesn't make a difference.
- Astor, I'm doing the best I can here.

26:36.433 --> 26:38.685
Let's just sit down
and have some breakfast.

26:38.811 --> 26:40.103
I don't want to!

26:40.229 --> 26:42.272
- I wanna go back home!
- Astor...

26:42.398 --> 26:44.148
- Stop it!
- Yeah, just stop it!

26:44.275 --> 26:48.194
Both of you, just stop fighting all the time!
I hate it!

26:59.206 --> 27:03.710
While they're seeing the grief counsellor,
I'll be getting my own kind of therapy.

27:08.590 --> 27:10.883
So, is this, uh...

27:11.010 --> 27:12.760
something we should talk about?

27:12.886 --> 27:15.430
Whatever's going on between us?

27:15.556 --> 27:18.099
- No.
- We have sex one day, and then...

27:18.225 --> 27:20.685
I'm sorry, I'm not the kind of person
who would ever have sex with you.

27:20.811 --> 27:22.854
- I don't know what we're doing.
- We're not doing anything.

27:22.980 --> 27:25.523
We never did do anything.
We never will do anything.

27:25.649 --> 27:26.899
- So we never had sex?
- Exactly.

27:27.026 --> 27:29.152
That's really weird.
Cos I remember...

27:29.278 --> 27:31.446
I gotta go now. I'm gonna go.

27:41.415 --> 27:44.417
- How's it going?
- I hate this shit.

27:49.965 --> 27:51.424
This is Dexter's job.

27:51.550 --> 27:53.259
Blood. It's gross.

27:54.970 --> 27:56.429
Well, whoever cut the head off

27:56.555 --> 27:58.556
used the same weapon to cut
the eyes and the tongue out.

27:58.682 --> 28:00.600
But I can't find anything that fits.

28:00.726 --> 28:02.643
I've tried two swords, three knives.

28:02.770 --> 28:04.729
Try the machete.

28:09.068 --> 28:10.651
Yeah.

28:24.583 --> 28:26.209
Huh!

28:26.335 --> 28:28.336
I think we have a match.

28:30.089 --> 28:31.839
I'll send somebody over there right away.

28:31.965 --> 28:33.216
OK, yeah.

28:40.391 --> 28:42.350
How's it going in there?

28:42.976 --> 28:45.353
Masuka said he really likes
working with the blood.

28:45.479 --> 28:47.313
He hopes he can get
more assignments like this.

28:47.439 --> 28:50.274
I'll keep that in mind.
Let me ask you a question.

28:50.401 --> 28:51.317
If you were married,

28:51.443 --> 28:54.028
and you found out that the person
you were married to

28:54.154 --> 28:56.906
had a secret bank account
with a lot of money,

28:57.032 --> 28:58.366
do you think that person
should share it?

28:58.492 --> 29:01.452
Jesus, Angel. Just because you married her
doesn't mean you own her.

29:01.578 --> 29:03.621
It's her money. End of story.

29:04.748 --> 29:07.375
Well, you got a dead body waiting for you.

29:14.842 --> 29:18.344
Oh! Fuck me.
Why couldn't he have just hanged himself,

29:18.470 --> 29:21.013
took some pills,
stuck his head in the oven?

29:21.140 --> 29:22.974
People are so rude. Excuse me.

29:23.100 --> 29:25.810
- You again.
- It's my neighbourhood.

29:25.936 --> 29:27.937
You were right about the machete.

29:28.063 --> 29:29.564
Good, I guess.

29:32.234 --> 29:34.444
- So, what do we have here?
- Well, golly gee, Deb,

29:34.570 --> 29:36.320
I think we got a shotgun wound
to the head.

29:36.447 --> 29:38.614
Approximately 24 hours ago.

29:38.740 --> 29:40.533
Make sure you swab the gun.

29:40.659 --> 29:42.577
- And check his hands for GSR.
- I got it, I got it.

29:42.703 --> 29:45.037
I'm just checking.
Dexter usually works cases like this.

29:45.164 --> 29:46.080
Do we have an ID?

29:46.206 --> 29:48.291
According to this, Francisco Alfaro.

29:48.417 --> 29:50.418
Hey, can we roll him over?

29:53.714 --> 29:58.092
Oh! Looks like his face has changed a little
since his driver's license picture was taken.

30:01.013 --> 30:02.805
Looks like him.

30:03.640 --> 30:06.809
- Hey... check out the girl.
- What?

30:06.935 --> 30:09.812
Look at her.
Imagine she has no eyes and no tongue.

30:09.938 --> 30:11.481
- Holy shit.
- It's her, isn't it?

30:11.607 --> 30:14.901
Those are the exact same earrings.
We've got our head.

30:15.027 --> 30:18.154
Bingo.
Looks like we've got a murder-suicide here.

30:18.280 --> 30:21.115
- How you figure?
- Guy gets pissed at his wife,

30:21.241 --> 30:23.826
cuts her head off,
leaves it in the park for everyone to see

30:23.952 --> 30:26.120
and comes home,
blows his head off.

30:26.246 --> 30:29.165
Masuka, we've got some brain goo
on the ceiling you need to photograph.

30:29.291 --> 30:30.958
Fuck me up the goat ass.

30:31.084 --> 30:34.504
What about all that
Santa Muerte stuff, then?

30:34.630 --> 30:36.881
Yeah.
There is no Santa Muerte stuff.

30:37.007 --> 30:38.674
That's what I'm saying.
There was at the park.

30:38.800 --> 30:41.886
There was missing eyes and a tongue
and the gold candles and the icons.

30:42.012 --> 30:44.180
- There's none of that here.
- No.

30:45.516 --> 30:47.517
What do you think?

30:47.643 --> 30:50.394
- I think you're right.
- Who's she?

30:55.192 --> 30:57.568
Hey... when is Dexter coming back?

31:03.700 --> 31:06.369
Boyd Fowler works the seven to four shift,

31:06.495 --> 31:08.538
which gives me time
to check out his house,

31:08.664 --> 31:11.832
see if there's anything
that'll put him on my table.

31:13.502 --> 31:15.336
Let me guess.

31:15.462 --> 31:19.298
This is you putting on
your oxygen mask first.

31:19.424 --> 31:23.177
Being on the hunt keeps me sharp.
Focused.

31:23.303 --> 31:26.138
Thus, the better killer I am,
the better father.

31:56.253 --> 31:59.046
So he takes his work home with him.
No crime in that.

32:11.560 --> 32:12.977
A man of simple taste.

32:16.481 --> 32:18.232
Looks like my grandmother's house.

32:22.362 --> 32:24.905
A loaded handgun.
A no-no for a convicted felon.

32:25.032 --> 32:27.450
But even so, not much to go on.

32:28.577 --> 32:31.370
Boyd, you are very boring.

32:36.627 --> 32:37.918
Shit.

32:39.379 --> 32:41.505
Boyd comes home for lunch.

32:44.509 --> 32:46.218
OK, that's interesting.

32:52.809 --> 32:55.645
Do you want
to have control of your life?

32:57.439 --> 32:59.523
You have that power.

32:59.650 --> 33:02.652
You just have to learn how to use it.

33:02.778 --> 33:05.112
You can make up all the excuses you want.

33:05.238 --> 33:07.531
You're too tired.

33:07.658 --> 33:09.533
Who keeps their attic door locked?

33:09.660 --> 33:13.412
Too old. Too fat.

33:13.538 --> 33:16.707
Too stupid.
You know, I've heard them all.

33:16.833 --> 33:20.252
Chicken noodle, chicken noodle,
chicken noodle. Where's the tomato?

33:20.379 --> 33:22.963
- But if you want something, take it!
- Take it!

33:24.675 --> 33:26.676
You want that job?

33:26.802 --> 33:28.969
- Well, then, take it!
- Well, then, take it!

33:29.096 --> 33:31.430
It's entirely up to you.

33:31.556 --> 33:34.016
The world does not...

33:34.476 --> 33:36.852
You want that nice house
on the beach?

33:36.978 --> 33:38.896
- Take it!
- Take it!

33:39.481 --> 33:42.608
The world does not put limitations
on what you can have.

33:42.734 --> 33:44.402
But if you want something...

33:44.528 --> 33:45.611
- Take it!
- Take it!

33:45.737 --> 33:47.446
You have that power.

33:47.572 --> 33:49.990
I can see having
an old girlfriend's lock of hair...

33:52.411 --> 33:54.203
but identified only by a number?

33:54.329 --> 33:57.498
We are our own worst enemy.

33:57.624 --> 33:59.166
Make no mistake about it.

33:59.292 --> 34:00.960
But with a few simple steps,

34:01.086 --> 34:04.839
I can teach you how to take control
of your life.

34:04.965 --> 34:06.215
Take it!

34:06.341 --> 34:07.967
All I'm saying...

34:08.093 --> 34:11.262
if a woman pissed me off enough,
yeah, I'd wanna cut her head off.

34:11.388 --> 34:12.513
Well, that's great to hear.

34:12.639 --> 34:14.598
No, I'm not saying I would do it.

34:14.725 --> 34:18.102
But I understand the impulse.
What are we doing here?

34:18.228 --> 34:20.521
I told Dexter I'd check this place out for him.

34:23.483 --> 34:25.192
Oh! Come in, come in.

34:25.318 --> 34:26.444
- Hey.
- Hi!

34:26.570 --> 34:30.531
We've just painted and installed
new flooring throughout the house.

34:30.657 --> 34:32.199
- Looks great.
- Ooh!

34:32.325 --> 34:33.826
Lots of young couples
in the neighbourhood.

34:33.952 --> 34:36.829
And the elementary school
is about three blocks away.

34:36.955 --> 34:39.915
I'm sure you'd be very happy here.

34:40.041 --> 34:43.544
- Oh, it's not for us, we...
- I think we'd be very happy here too.

34:43.670 --> 34:45.337
Thank you.

34:45.464 --> 34:47.757
Well, I have to get a few things
out of my car.

34:47.883 --> 34:50.718
But if you have any questions,
I'll just be right outside.

34:50.844 --> 34:52.219
Thank you.

34:54.639 --> 34:57.391
- It's a nice kitchen.
- Uh-huh.

34:57.517 --> 34:59.769
- Decent appliances.
- Uh-huh!

35:00.771 --> 35:02.813
Oh, look at this.

35:02.939 --> 35:04.899
Great bedroom. Check it out.

35:05.650 --> 35:06.776
Don't.

35:06.902 --> 35:10.279
Oh! Wow.

35:11.406 --> 35:13.324
Comfy bed.

35:13.450 --> 35:14.742
Feel it.

35:15.577 --> 35:18.370
- Get off the bed.
- What do you say? A little nap time?

35:18.497 --> 35:20.331
- I'm leaving.
- What did I do?

35:20.457 --> 35:24.084
I've got to drop you off at the station,
then pick up my brother's kids.

35:27.798 --> 35:30.883
How desperate am I,
to follow Boyd to the middle of nowhere

35:31.009 --> 35:33.803
when all I've got is a bit of blood
and a lock of hair?

35:44.022 --> 35:46.649
But with nothing else to go on...

36:05.502 --> 36:06.877
It's a rule of nature.

36:07.003 --> 36:09.672
Leave some old bedsprings
out in the middle of nowhere,

36:09.798 --> 36:11.966
and soon it'll be joined by a refrigerator,

36:12.092 --> 36:14.844
couch, car engine.

36:16.179 --> 36:19.014
And now, a barrel,
most likely holding dead animals.

36:19.140 --> 36:22.017
Too lazy to drive it back to the incinerator,
I suppose.

36:25.230 --> 36:26.981
- Hey, Deb.
- Do you have the kids?

36:27.107 --> 36:28.774
Harrison's with Bill and Maura

36:28.900 --> 36:31.735
and Astor and Cody are with you?

36:31.862 --> 36:34.613
- Shit!
- What's going on?

36:34.739 --> 36:36.657
Did you drop them off at school
this morning?

36:36.783 --> 36:40.578
Yeah, they were seeing the counsellor first,
then going to their regular classes.

36:40.704 --> 36:43.914
I just went to pick them up, and the woman
said that they never went to class.

36:44.040 --> 36:47.376
So I called the apartment,
and there's no answer.

36:47.502 --> 36:48.586
Well, where are they?

36:48.712 --> 36:51.130
That's my question, big brother.
Where would they go?

36:51.256 --> 36:53.841
Same place Astor
keeps saying she wants to go.

36:57.804 --> 36:59.388
Astor.

37:01.224 --> 37:03.058
Cody.

37:13.278 --> 37:14.278
Hey.

37:17.949 --> 37:19.199
How'd you guys get here?

37:19.326 --> 37:20.868
We walked.

37:21.661 --> 37:23.329
Don't be mad, Dexter.

37:24.539 --> 37:28.626
They wanted to see where it happened.
Where they lost their mother.

37:28.752 --> 37:30.711
I'm not mad.

37:32.172 --> 37:34.173
Astor, I'm sorry.
I should have listened to you.

37:34.299 --> 37:36.592
I should have brought you back here,
like you asked.

37:39.346 --> 37:42.056
If you want to move back here, we will.
We'll find a way to make it work.

37:42.182 --> 37:43.891
No, we won't.

37:50.649 --> 37:51.774
Astor, I'm sorry.

37:51.900 --> 37:54.485
You keep saying that,
but I don't care.

37:54.611 --> 37:55.986
You ruined everything.

37:56.112 --> 37:58.155
We'd gotten used to it.
It wasn't that bad!

37:58.281 --> 38:01.075
- Used to what?
- To the way things were!

38:01.201 --> 38:02.826
Before you! Without a dad!

38:02.953 --> 38:04.203
Oh.

38:04.329 --> 38:06.580
And then you come along
and become a part of the family,

38:06.706 --> 38:09.917
and we thought that everything
was gonna be good forever.

38:11.169 --> 38:13.128
You made us think that!

38:14.130 --> 38:16.340
And it's not true.

38:16.466 --> 38:18.926
Things got worse.

38:19.052 --> 38:22.972
Now, every time I look at you I get so angry, because it was
all just a lie!

38:25.517 --> 38:28.519
It's not Dexter's fault.

38:30.438 --> 38:33.273
I thought coming here would help.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.401
But that was stupid.

38:36.695 --> 38:38.696
No, I understand.

38:39.698 --> 38:42.616
It looks exactly the same as before.

38:45.620 --> 38:47.371
Yeah, it does.

38:48.123 --> 38:50.666
You can't even tell what happened.

38:52.085 --> 38:54.211
But I know my mom died there.

38:54.337 --> 38:56.088
And things will never be the same.

38:56.214 --> 38:58.841
- I miss her so much.
- I do too.

39:00.468 --> 39:02.636
We all do.

39:02.762 --> 39:04.346
I don't want to live with you.

39:04.472 --> 39:06.306
I want to live with Grandma and Grandpa.

39:06.433 --> 39:08.892
I want to go back with them tonight.
Right now!

39:26.661 --> 39:29.621
Hey. I'm heading out.
You want to grab a bite somewhere?

39:29.748 --> 39:31.457
No. Why would I wanna do that?

39:31.583 --> 39:33.000
All right.

39:38.214 --> 39:39.298
Hey, Lieutenant.

39:39.424 --> 39:41.633
Deb told me about
the Kyle Butler sketches.

39:41.760 --> 39:44.053
Yeah, well, I'm not sure
how useful they'll be.

39:44.179 --> 39:47.848
The mother and two children
all gave very different versions.

39:49.100 --> 39:52.936
It's their biggest lead.
Seems to be going nowhere.

39:53.063 --> 39:54.646
Do you mind if I keep a copy of these?

39:54.773 --> 39:56.482
No, I got plenty.

40:03.448 --> 40:04.907
Angel.

40:05.533 --> 40:07.534
Let me ask you a question.

40:08.495 --> 40:12.956
Can you tell me why you kept
this much money a secret from me?

40:15.335 --> 40:19.004
It was never a secret.
That's my retirement fund.

40:19.130 --> 40:21.256
Now that we're married,
aren't we supposed to share everything?

40:21.382 --> 40:22.966
I don't think we ever discussed that.

40:23.093 --> 40:26.011
Maybe we have different ideas
about what a marriage should be.

40:26.137 --> 40:29.515
Because I always pictured
you and I at 80 years old,

40:29.641 --> 40:31.934
walking down the beach,
hand in hand.

40:32.060 --> 40:35.354
I like to picture that as well, Angel.

40:35.939 --> 40:37.272
I love you.

40:37.398 --> 40:40.192
But I think maybe I have more of a...

40:40.318 --> 40:42.319
- practical side than you do.
- What does that mean?

40:42.445 --> 40:46.323
I mean I've worked my entire career
to save up, to protect myself,

40:46.449 --> 40:48.534
and you live every day like it's a party.

40:48.660 --> 40:50.994
It's one of the things I like about you,

40:51.121 --> 40:54.373
but it also means that you spend money
faster than you even make it.

40:54.499 --> 40:56.416
- OK.
- And it's, I'm...

40:56.543 --> 40:58.377
OK, I get it.

40:59.379 --> 41:00.879
I don't mean to hurt your feelings.

41:01.005 --> 41:03.757
No, I'm fine. I'm irresponsible.

41:03.883 --> 41:06.176
- Oh, Maria.
- Everyone knows that.

41:11.808 --> 41:14.893
Hey, everyone! Drinks on me. Tonight.

41:15.019 --> 41:17.229
Yeah!

41:18.148 --> 41:19.606
Angel.

41:22.527 --> 41:23.735
Hey.

41:27.824 --> 41:30.284
So, everyone's home safe?

41:30.410 --> 41:32.411
Yeah, they're all inside.

41:36.291 --> 41:38.792
You think they're finally settling in?

41:40.545 --> 41:42.087
They're packing.

41:44.048 --> 41:47.926
- What do you mean?
- Astor and Cody are leaving.

41:48.595 --> 41:53.098
Soon as their grandparents get here,
they're going back to Orlando with them.

41:56.269 --> 41:58.187
Dex, I'm so sorry.

42:01.399 --> 42:02.941
For how long?

42:03.067 --> 42:04.610
I don't know.

42:05.403 --> 42:08.906
- Well, maybe if I talk to Astor...
- I already tried.

42:10.033 --> 42:13.660
- And Cody wants to go too?
- No, he wants to stay.

42:15.747 --> 42:18.373
It got very upsetting.

42:18.499 --> 42:20.292
What did you say?

42:22.045 --> 42:25.589
I reminded him that you and I are brother and sister,
just like him and Astor,

42:25.715 --> 42:30.052
and that it's...
important that they never split up.

42:35.266 --> 42:37.726
All the shit we've been through.

42:37.852 --> 42:41.688
I never would have
made it through without you.

42:46.152 --> 42:48.195
That's what I tried to tell him.

42:50.031 --> 42:51.865
Did it help?

42:51.991 --> 42:53.116
Not really.

42:55.828 --> 42:57.788
I really was trying...

42:59.374 --> 43:01.166
to make it work.

43:03.378 --> 43:06.004
- In my own way.
- Yeah, I know you were.

43:11.594 --> 43:14.054
I guess it's time to face reality.

43:32.073 --> 43:33.407
Reality.

43:38.871 --> 43:41.164
- Quinn.
- OK, we had sex.

43:42.583 --> 43:44.167
Was it good sex?

43:44.294 --> 43:47.087
I've said all I'm gonna say.

43:47.213 --> 43:49.172
Are we gonna have more sex?

43:49.299 --> 43:52.342
- Goodbye.
- Come on. Help me out here.

43:52.468 --> 43:55.262
I'm hanging up now.

44:11.654 --> 44:16.199
If she wants to live her life stashing away
all her little pennies, that's her problem.

44:16.326 --> 44:19.911
I can't do anything about that. You know?

44:21.372 --> 44:24.166
- You want another drink?
- You buying, right?

44:24.292 --> 44:26.752
Bartender, a Cuervo silver.

44:26.878 --> 44:29.921
You know how much money she's got?
It's sick.

44:30.048 --> 44:32.799
Did she tell me?
Did she tell me?

44:32.925 --> 44:34.134
Cheers.

44:37.096 --> 44:38.263
Angel.

44:41.100 --> 44:43.727
It true you married Maria LaGuerta?

44:44.520 --> 44:46.938
I did indeed.

44:48.149 --> 44:50.359
You got yourself a little sugar mama.

44:52.862 --> 44:54.154
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

44:54.280 --> 44:58.075
I remember when she was first starting out.
Such a fine piece of ass.

44:58.201 --> 45:00.619
I think you need to get the hell out of here.

45:03.289 --> 45:05.082
You fuck!

45:26.270 --> 45:28.397
If they need anything,
just let me know. I'll send it.

45:28.523 --> 45:30.023
We will. Thank you.

45:33.820 --> 45:36.613
I lost my innocence at such an early age,

45:36.739 --> 45:38.990
and it left a very damaging mark.

45:42.203 --> 45:45.122
Can't I stay with you, Dexter?

45:45.998 --> 45:49.418
For now, you need to go
with your grandparents.

45:49.544 --> 45:53.422
Don't worry, we'll still see each other
all the time. Orlando's not so far.

45:54.841 --> 45:56.425
Yes, it is.

45:56.551 --> 45:59.219
Any shrink could tell you
that's why I've always liked children.

45:59.345 --> 46:02.097
Because they connect me
to what I can never get back.

46:03.683 --> 46:06.017
I don't want to go, Dexter.

46:08.771 --> 46:10.313
I don't want you to go.

46:21.367 --> 46:23.410
Astor...

46:24.162 --> 46:26.037
What?

46:30.001 --> 46:33.420
Your mother loved you more
than you could ever imagine.

46:34.755 --> 46:36.339
And I...

46:41.429 --> 46:43.680
Me too.

47:10.458 --> 47:14.336
Cody and Astor showed me
that I can still care about something.

47:15.338 --> 47:18.381
That makes letting them go
all that much harder.

47:33.105 --> 47:35.649
And it's losing them
that makes me realise

47:35.775 --> 47:39.611
there must be some small part
of that innocent child still inside me.

47:48.120 --> 47:49.496
Because, just like Astor,

47:49.622 --> 47:53.250
I was foolish enough to think
that things would always be good.

47:53.918 --> 47:55.252
But they're not.

48:06.305 --> 48:07.681
They're worse.

48:17.441 --> 48:19.442
Much worse.

48:20.278 --> 48:23.572
Normally, having a target
would make me feel good,

48:23.698 --> 48:26.408
give me direction, a sense of purpose.

48:26.534 --> 48:27.909
But now...

48:32.790 --> 48:34.916
it means nothing.

48:35.042 --> 48:38.712
And I don't know what's
going to make me feel better.

48:40.423 --> 48:41.881
Should we go home?

48:43.593 --> 48:45.385
Give me a minute.

48:46.310 --> 48:52.343
