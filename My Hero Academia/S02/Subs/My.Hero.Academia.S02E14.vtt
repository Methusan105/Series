1
00:00:01.543 --> 00:00:03.545
Whether or not anyone asked for you.

2
00:00:03.711 --> 00:00:06.924
you will all be participating
in internships with pros.

3
00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.469
<i>You've got an offer from a hero!</i>

4
00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:13.722
The hero's name is Gran Torino.

5
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.560
He was a teacher at U.A.
for only one year.

6
00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:20.979
The man who was my homeroom teacher.

7
00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:26.276
I'm here from U.A. High.
My name is Izuku Midoriya.

8
00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:28.028
Nice to meet yo…

9
00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:35.452
He's dead!

10
00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:37.496
I'm alive!

11
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.874
He's alive!

12
00:01:01.645 --> 00:01:04.438
<i>I am Izuku Midoriya. born Quirkless</i>

13
00:01:04.605 --> 00:01:07.109
<i>and a student at U.A. High.</i>

14
00:01:07.276 --> 00:01:10.737
<i>With the help of my friends. I will become</i>
<i>the greatest hero of all time!</i>

15
00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:12.364
<i>In </i>My Hero Academia<i>!</i>

16
00:02:13.634 --> 00:02:15.344
Man…

17
00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:21.141
When I was carrying a string of sausages
with ketchup poured over them. I fell!

18
00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:23.727
<i>That's too easily misunderstood!</i>

19
00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:25.687
Who are you?

20
00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:28.357
I'm Izuku Midoriya from U.A.!

21
00:02:28.524 --> 00:02:29.650
What?

22
00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.360
I'm Izuku Midoriya!

23
00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:34.363
Who are you?

24
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.365
<i>Crap…</i>

25
00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:38.367
<i>He's All Might's teacher.</i>

26
00:02:38.534 --> 00:02:42.037
<i>I knew he would be pretty old.</i>
<i>but this is…</i>

27
00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:45.791
-I wanna eat something.
-Eat?

28
00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:48.168
Toshinori!

29
00:02:48.544 --> 00:02:49.503
No. that's not me!

30
00:02:52.673 --> 00:02:56.218
Excuse me. I'm going to make a phone call…

31
00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.390
<i>Anyway. I should let All Might</i>
<i>know about the state this guy's in…</i>

32
00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:05.102
What're you doing?

33
00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.146
Fire off a One For All at me.

34
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.110
I wanna know how well you can handle it.

35
00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.321
<i>What's with this guy? Suddenly…</i>

36
00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:19.074
This is a good costume. Wear it and fire!

37
00:03:20.576 --> 00:03:21.535
Um…

38
00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:24.496
Who are you?

39
00:03:24.663 --> 00:03:26.999
<i>It's no good!</i>

40
00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:30.085
I need to hurry

41
00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:34.006
and quickly become able
to handle my power.

42
00:03:35.424 --> 00:03:39.261
Because All Might
doesn't have any time left.

43
00:03:41.138 --> 00:03:42.139
That's why…

44
00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:45.642
I can't waste time
messing around with you. sir.

45
00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:46.935
Please excuse me.

46
00:03:48.187 --> 00:03:49.062
In that case…

47
00:04:04.912 --> 00:04:07.372
In that case. there's even
more reason to fire one off!

48
00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:09.541
You zygote!

49
00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:14.379
BIZARRE! GRAN TORINO APPEARS

50
00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:17.925
I watched the U.A. sports festival on TV.

51
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.304
<i>The way you used that power</i>
<i>was unthinkable!</i>

52
00:04:23.222 --> 00:04:27.851
He's called the symbol of peace
and the number one hero.

53
00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:30.687
but that justice-obsessed All Might
is worse

54
00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:34.441
than a novice when it comes to teaching.

55
00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:38.820
Now. shall we begin. you zygotes?

56
00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:41.114
<i>He's using the same phrase.</i>

57
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:42.491
<i>The way they play dumb is the same. too.</i>

58
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.370
<i>This person must be</i>
<i>All Might's teacher. after all!</i>

59
00:04:46.537 --> 00:04:49.122
I can't stand watching
how you're using your power.

60
00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.791
so I'll teach you.

61
00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:54.253
Now. put on your costume!

62
00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:58.340
I look forward to working with you!

63
00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:00.008
HERO COSTUME
SPECIFICATIONS &amp; USER MANUAL

64
00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:01.051
The user manual.

65
00:05:01.218 --> 00:05:03.011
<i>Dear Mr. Izuku Midoriya.</i>

66
00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:04.930
<i>when making repairs to your costume.</i>

67
00:05:05.097 --> 00:05:09.268
<i>our company decided to make</i>
<i>some changes to the materials and design.</i>

68
00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:11.228
<i>Thank you for understanding.</i>

69
00:05:11.395 --> 00:05:13.939
<i>I mean. it'll definitely</i>
<i>be a lot cooler like this!</i>

70
00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:19.194
<i>They changed the materials</i>
<i>and design without asking…</i>

71
00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:22.155
<i>I wonder if everyone in the support</i>
<i>business is like Hatsume…</i>

72
00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:25.826
<i>Either way. it's my first battle</i>
<i>with version beta</i>

73
00:05:26.285 --> 00:05:27.536
<i>of my mom's suit!</i>

74
00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:31.874
My preparations are complete.

75
00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:33.542
Then. do it.

76
00:05:34.126 --> 00:05:35.836
Is this really okay?

77
00:05:36.003 --> 00:05:38.380
Honestly. I don't know
how well I can use this suit yet.

78
00:05:38.797 --> 00:05:43.302
and if there isn't more space.
if I fire at 100% by accident.

79
00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:45.429
your body wouldn't be able to take it.
sir…

80
00:05:45.596 --> 00:05:48.223
Good grief. you're such a chatterbox.

81
00:05:52.186 --> 00:05:53.770
I'm losing patience!

82
00:05:55.314 --> 00:05:56.607
We're having real combat?

83
00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:04.781
You couldn't see my true strength
with that hit earlier?

84
00:06:06.617 --> 00:06:12.206
I can't believe the ninth holder
of One For All is such a wet blanket.

85
00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:15.667
All Might is a real novice.

86
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.256
<i>He's too fast!</i>

87
00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:22.674
<i>What's his Quirk?</i>

88
00:06:26.637 --> 00:06:27.846
<i>No. that's not it.</i>

89
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.057
<i>Under these circumstances where</i>
<i>there's no place to hide and no openings.</i>

90
00:06:30.224 --> 00:06:32.518
<i>rather than carefully figuring out</i>
<i>where he is.</i>

91
00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:34.520
<i>I should keep him from moving.</i>

92
00:06:37.064 --> 00:06:39.441
<i>Imagine the egg not breaking</i>
<i>inside the microwave!</i>

93
00:06:42.778 --> 00:06:44.821
<i>He's passed behind me twice!</i>

94
00:06:45.781 --> 00:06:46.823
<i>Then…</i>

95
00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:50.202
Analysis and prediction. huh?

96
00:06:50.661 --> 00:06:52.412
<i>Smash!</i>

97
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.956
But.

98
00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:55.666
you're stiff!

99
00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:59.044
And there's discord within your mind!

100
00:07:01.213 --> 00:07:02.673
That's why it turned out like this.

101
00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:05.676
I thought I had you for sure!

102
00:07:05.843 --> 00:07:06.885
That's it.

103
00:07:07.511 --> 00:07:11.515
<i>The way you used One For All</i>
<i>in the cavalry battle and the tournament…</i>

104
00:07:11.932 --> 00:07:14.226
<i>You should already understand it.</i>

105
00:07:14.935 --> 00:07:19.189
But your admiration for All Might
and your sense of duty are like shackles.

106
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:21.859
"Shackles"?

107
00:07:22.234 --> 00:07:25.779
It's true that you need to get stronger.
fast.

108
00:07:25.946 --> 00:07:30.951
But time and enemies won't wait
until you get stronger.

109
00:07:31.118 --> 00:07:34.162
You're thinking One For All
is more special than it is.

110
00:07:34.663 --> 00:07:36.081
Then. what should I do?

111
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.917
Think about the answer yourself.

112
00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:41.003
I'll go buy some grub.

113
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:42.754
I'll leave the cleaning to you.

114
00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:44.047
Huh?

115
00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:49.595
<i>My admiration for All Might… is a shackle?</i>

116
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.514
SAME TIME - HOSU CITY

117
00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:56.018
Normally. we're mostly just
waiting for calls from clients.

118
00:07:56.185 --> 00:07:59.396
but recently. you know.
Hosu's been kind of hectic.

119
00:07:59.563 --> 00:08:01.940
Street patrols become
a way to suppress crime.

120
00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:03.317
That's right.

121
00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:07.988
But man. I can't believe Ingenium's
little brother is interning at my agency.

122
00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:11.575
I'm sure you had offers from heroes
more capable than me.

123
00:08:13.994 --> 00:08:19.875
<i>Hero Killer… So elusive. he can't even</i>
<i>be caught by the net of modern society.</i>

124
00:08:21.168 --> 00:08:23.045
<i>I know this might be in vain.</i>

125
00:08:23.212 --> 00:08:24.087
<i>Even so…</i>

126
00:08:27.216 --> 00:08:29.801
<i>Even so. I cannot </i>not<i> go after him.</i>

127
00:08:31.178 --> 00:08:34.472
<i>I… cannot forgive him!</i>

128
00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:38.809
<i>I see.</i>

129
00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:42.231
You were the ones who attacked U.A.

130
00:08:43.065 --> 00:08:46.652
And you want to add me to your numbers.

131
00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:50.739
Yeah. Come on. you've got so
much more experience as a villain. sir.

132
00:08:50.906 --> 00:08:52.157
What are you after?

133
00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:55.994
For now. I just want to kill All Might.

134
00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:58.956
I want to break everything I don't like.

135
00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:03.544
Damn kids like this. too… Everything…

136
00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.090
I was foolish to be interested.

137
00:09:08.507 --> 00:09:11.927
You're the type of person I hate the most.

138
00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:13.220
Huh?

139
00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:16.014
You want me to go along
with your childish tantrum?

140
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.352
What meaning is there
in killing without conviction?

141
00:09:21.228 --> 00:09:23.355
Hero Killer: Stain…

142
00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:26.441
The man brought in to spur

143
00:09:26.608 --> 00:09:29.862
Tomura Shigaraki's growth.
since he cares only about destruction…

144
00:09:30.821 --> 00:09:32.406
However. this is…

145
00:09:33.866 --> 00:09:35.951
Master.
is it all right to let this continue?

146
00:09:36.326 --> 00:09:37.953
<i>This is fine!</i>

147
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.706
<i>There's no point</i>
<i>if we just tell him the answer.</i>

148
00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:44.376
<i>He should think about</i>
<i>where he still needs to mature.</i>

149
00:09:44.543 --> 00:09:45.961
<i>Spur on his growth!</i>

150
00:09:47.296 --> 00:09:50.299
<i>That is what it means to educate.</i>

151
00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:57.097
My admiration for All Might is a shackle.

152
00:09:58.223 --> 00:10:01.351
Even though I understand how to use it.
there's discord in my mind…

153
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:04.813
<i>I'm thinking One For All</i>
<i>is more special than it is.</i>

154
00:10:05.606 --> 00:10:07.691
<i>Is that what's making my movements stiff?</i>

155
00:10:07.858 --> 00:10:09.902
<i>What does "stiff" mean in the first place?</i>

156
00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:13.071
Thinking about it another way.
what makes movement flexible?

157
00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:14.489
Flexible…

158
00:10:15.282 --> 00:10:16.325
I know!

159
00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:20.954
I've been thinking about One For All
and the smash as a special move.

160
00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:23.081
<i>I saw it used up close…</i>

161
00:10:23.624 --> 00:10:24.958
<i>Why didn't I notice?</i>

162
00:10:25.501 --> 00:10:28.212
That's right.
Quirks are part of your body.

163
00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:32.049
I need to think of One For All more.
more evenly!

164
00:10:32.925 --> 00:10:34.134
That's it! I see!

165
00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:36.053
<i>His thinking is flexible.</i>

166
00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.889
<i>I knew that from the way</i>
<i>he moved at the sports festival.</i>

167
00:10:40.015 --> 00:10:44.561
<i>You found someone pretty good.</i>
<i>huh. Toshinori?</i>

168
00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:47.272
<i>All Might…</i>

169
00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:50.567
IN THE CENTER OF TOKYO

170
00:10:51.735 --> 00:10:52.778
GENIUS OFFICE

171
00:10:52.945 --> 00:10:55.697
Frankly. I don't like you.

172
00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:57.366
Huh?

173
00:10:58.534 --> 00:11:00.827
You only chose my agency because

174
00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:04.414
I'm one of the top five
most popular heroes. right?

175
00:11:05.082 --> 00:11:07.376
You're the one that put in an offer!

176
00:11:07.543 --> 00:11:08.502
Yeah.

177
00:11:08.669 --> 00:11:11.463
Recently. I've only been
getting good little kids.

178
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.257
so you were the first one
in a while to strike a chord.

179
00:11:14.842 --> 00:11:17.427
<i>I watched you at the sports festival.</i>

180
00:11:17.803 --> 00:11:20.514
<i>You were able to freely manipulate</i>
<i>a Quirk with high potential.</i>

181
00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:23.141
<i>and had a good grasp</i>
<i>of application as well.</i>

182
00:11:23.767 --> 00:11:28.188
<i>You're an outstanding talent already</i>
<i>good enough to recruit as a sidekick.</i>

183
00:11:29.106 --> 00:11:32.317
However. you have a fatal flaw.

184
00:11:32.818 --> 00:11:35.112
You believe yourself to be the strongest.

185
00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:37.739
and you try to put that into practice
not caring about how that looks.

186
00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:39.992
You have a ferocious nature.

187
00:11:40.993 --> 00:11:43.829
Did you choose me to give me a lecture--

188
00:11:45.831 --> 00:11:49.585
It is part of my work as a hero
to correct people like you.

189
00:11:50.419 --> 00:11:53.088
Heroes and villains are
two sides of the same coin.

190
00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:55.883
I'll show those glaring eyes of yours

191
00:11:56.592 --> 00:11:59.386
what makes someone a hero.

192
00:12:00.095 --> 00:12:01.471
What're you trying to do?

193
00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:02.639
Isn't it obvious?

194
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.227
I'm educating you
to become an exemplary hero.

195
00:12:07.561 --> 00:12:08.645
The way you speak.

196
00:12:08.812 --> 00:12:12.774
your appearance. controlling
your emotions. enforcing your morals…

197
00:12:13.567 --> 00:12:15.736
There are countless things to do.

198
00:12:15.903 --> 00:12:18.030
In the short period of a week.

199
00:12:18.697 --> 00:12:21.617
I will sew all that into your body.

200
00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:24.244
FOURTH KIND AGENCY

201
00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:25.412
Tetsutetsu!

202
00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:26.580
Kirishima!

203
00:12:26.747 --> 00:12:28.165
Why are you here?

204
00:12:28.332 --> 00:12:31.168
We were able to put two offers in.

205
00:12:31.335 --> 00:12:32.211
Let's get started without ado.

206
00:12:32.836 --> 00:12:34.213
I look forward to working with you!

207
00:12:34.838 --> 00:12:38.050
I saw your guts at the sports festival.

208
00:12:38.217 --> 00:12:39.218
I like you two.

209
00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:44.348
However. being a hero's not so easy
that you can rely on brute force alone.

210
00:12:44.765 --> 00:12:47.100
I will teach you that as someone
with more experience.

211
00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:48.810
As expected of the Chivalrous Hero!

212
00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:50.270
So manly!

213
00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:52.314
Wait for me to finish!

214
00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:54.274
Sorry!

215
00:12:54.441 --> 00:12:56.735
I'll teach you manners properly. too.

216
00:12:56.902 --> 00:12:58.570
Thank you very much!

217
00:12:59.196 --> 00:13:01.406
First. I'll tell you the major premise.

218
00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:04.701
Pro heroes receive wages from
the government. so we are civil servants.

219
00:13:04.868 --> 00:13:06.787
but because of how this came about.

220
00:13:06.954 --> 00:13:11.083
civil servants and pro heroes
are very different.

221
00:13:11.792 --> 00:13:13.585
Regarding the actual duties of a pro hero…

222
00:13:14.211 --> 00:13:17.422
Basic hero duties involve
controlling crime. see?

223
00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:21.426
When a crime occurs. the police
will contact heroes for support.

224
00:13:21.593 --> 00:13:23.387
The requests will come
all at once by district. see?

225
00:13:23.804 --> 00:13:25.305
We file reports
on the services we provided.

226
00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:26.598
like assisting with arrests
or rescuing people.

227
00:13:26.765 --> 00:13:27.766
to the government office.

228
00:13:28.267 --> 00:13:32.020
And then. we receive pay based on an
examination conducted by a special agency.

229
00:13:32.187 --> 00:13:33.397
We usually get a percentage.

230
00:13:34.398 --> 00:13:36.650
<i>The way he talks is cute.</i>

231
00:13:37.109 --> 00:13:39.903
In addition. heroes are allowed
to have side jobs.

232
00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:44.491
When this was made official.
there was a lot of argument about this.

233
00:13:44.658 --> 00:13:48.245
but that ended thanks to
our popularity and public demand.

234
00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:51.456
So now. I'm about to film a commercial.

235
00:13:51.623 --> 00:13:52.499
Stick around. okay?

236
00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:56.670
I wanted to experience
something more hero-like. though…

237
00:13:56.837 --> 00:14:00.340
No. this is not something you can
avoid if you want to become a pro!

238
00:14:00.674 --> 00:14:04.428
Besides. she is the one
who fell for pathetic little me…

239
00:14:05.596 --> 00:14:07.639
I will learn as much as I can!

240
00:14:07.806 --> 00:14:09.349
<i>She's going all out…</i>

241
00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:13.896
But all we can do while
you're filming is watch. right?

242
00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:17.649
Do you know why I chose you two?

243
00:14:18.108 --> 00:14:19.067
It's because…

244
00:14:19.234 --> 00:14:22.070
Isn't it because you fell
for our qualifications as heroes?

245
00:14:22.613 --> 00:14:24.948
Of course! But that's not all.

246
00:14:25.115 --> 00:14:25.991
Hm?

247
00:14:27.159 --> 00:14:29.119
It's also because you're cute!

248
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.121
Huh?

249
00:14:32.039 --> 00:14:34.374
Heroes must practice and train every day.

250
00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:37.002
That doesn't change
even if they are on patrol!

251
00:14:37.169 --> 00:14:38.253
Right!

252
00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:41.715
<i>Man. this is harder than class!</i>

253
00:14:42.174 --> 00:14:47.471
An important part of being a hero
is knowing how to pass idle hours.

254
00:14:47.638 --> 00:14:48.639
Do you understand?

255
00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:49.890
Yeah…

256
00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:53.393
<i>I'm not into this kind of stuff…</i>

257
00:14:58.774 --> 00:15:00.776
I have been waiting for you. Shoto.

258
00:15:01.193 --> 00:15:03.779
It seems you are finally ready
to take the path of the mighty. huh?

259
00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.574
I have no intention of
going down a path you made.

260
00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:09.952
I will take my own path.

261
00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:13.539
Oh well. you should get ready. too.

262
00:15:13.997 --> 00:15:15.123
We're going out.

263
00:15:15.666 --> 00:15:16.542
Where?

264
00:15:17.626 --> 00:15:20.337
I'll show you what a hero is.

265
00:15:20.963 --> 00:15:23.549
INTERNSHIP DAY ONE - NIGHT

266
00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.677
Z! Z!

267
00:15:27.511 --> 00:15:29.179
<i>He </i>is <i>sleeping. right?</i>

268
00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:33.559
<i>The first day.</i>
<i>he ended up just testing me.</i>

269
00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:36.019
<i>We didn't do any hero work.</i>

270
00:15:36.478 --> 00:15:38.856
<i>And after coming back from buying food.</i>
<i>he went to sleep.</i>

271
00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:44.194
<i>Gran Torino. I didn't get any hits</i>
<i>when I searched his name.</i>

272
00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:47.906
<i>A U.A. teacher for just one year.</i>

273
00:15:48.574 --> 00:15:50.492
<i>There are a lot of mysteries about him.</i>

274
00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:57.165
<i>I need to think of One For All.</i>
<i>of my own Quirk. more evenly.</i>

275
00:15:57.499 --> 00:16:01.170
<i>What Kacchan and the others can do</i>
<i>as naturally as breathing.</i>

276
00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:03.922
<i>I still feel the need to "use"</i>
<i>in a conscious way.</i>

277
00:16:04.089 --> 00:16:07.426
<i>If I can use my power at five percent</i>
<i>like breathing.</i>

278
00:16:07.593 --> 00:16:09.553
<i>movements like that won't be impossible!</i>

279
00:16:10.596 --> 00:16:13.265
<i>Mr. Aizawa and Kirishima said so. too.</i>

280
00:16:13.432 --> 00:16:16.518
<i>If I can master my Quirk.</i>
<i>there's a lot I can do!</i>

281
00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:19.813
<i>First off. using it instantaneously</i>
<i>and intermittently!</i>

282
00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:23.108
All right!
It's a matter of getting used to it.

283
00:16:24.026 --> 00:16:26.111
Even with just five percent.
I should be able to cross this distance.

284
00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:28.405
If I can go jump. jump. jump.

285
00:16:28.572 --> 00:16:30.115
then it'd be really cool!

286
00:16:32.075 --> 00:16:34.953
<i>Imagine an egg not breaking</i>
<i>in the microwave!</i>

287
00:16:42.503 --> 00:16:44.796
<i>Well. I knew this would happen…</i>

288
00:16:47.508 --> 00:16:51.303
<i>I need to brace myself…</i>
<i>and cushion my arms…</i>

289
00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:56.350
<i>Which means. from the second jump. I'll</i>
<i>need to put power into my arms and legs.</i>

290
00:16:56.517 --> 00:16:59.561
<i>But if I don't do it quickly.</i>
<i>then I might break more bones.</i>

291
00:17:00.521 --> 00:17:03.941
It'll take too long
to visualize like I usually do.

292
00:17:04.441 --> 00:17:06.068
All right. one more time!

293
00:17:10.446 --> 00:17:11.823
<i>Reinforce my arms…</i>

294
00:17:18.622 --> 00:17:19.998
<i>Switch faster…</i>

295
00:17:24.752 --> 00:17:26.839
Faster! Faster!

296
00:17:27.005 --> 00:17:28.048
What's that?

297
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.259
Let's go! We shouldn't get involved.

298
00:17:30.634 --> 00:17:32.636
Faster!

299
00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:42.980
Morning. What's wrong?

300
00:17:43.146 --> 00:17:46.900
I was training on my own yesterday
and got a little too caught up in it.

301
00:17:47.484 --> 00:17:51.655
I tried to digest what you said
to me and put it into practice.

302
00:17:51.989 --> 00:17:54.324
but I have a long way to go.

303
00:17:54.491 --> 00:17:57.077
It's your first time trying it.
so that's only to be expected.

304
00:17:57.244 --> 00:17:58.745
It can't be helped.

305
00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:02.332
It's hard to get that kind
of thinking from All Might.

306
00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:05.127
Since he was able to use
it normally from the start.

307
00:18:05.294 --> 00:18:07.754
I taught him in a different way.

308
00:18:08.172 --> 00:18:10.716
His only redeeming feature was his body.

309
00:18:10.883 --> 00:18:12.926
All Might as a student?

310
00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:14.553
What was he like?

311
00:18:15.429 --> 00:18:17.097
Hm? Oh…

312
00:18:18.182 --> 00:18:20.309
<i>It was nothing</i>
<i>but practical training for him.</i>

313
00:18:27.107 --> 00:18:29.693
<i>That's why he was so scared of you!</i>

314
00:18:30.569 --> 00:18:33.488
I couldn't teach him half-heartedly

315
00:18:33.739 --> 00:18:37.034
because he was the man entrusted to me
by my sworn friend. who had passed away.

316
00:18:37.492 --> 00:18:41.747
What? All Might's predecessor passed away?

317
00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.081
Huh?

318
00:18:43.707 --> 00:18:44.917
Delivery!

319
00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:47.002
Oh. I'll get it.

320
00:18:48.712 --> 00:18:52.049
<i>You haven't told him about</i>
<i>the seventh holder. Toshinori?</i>

321
00:18:54.843 --> 00:18:56.428
Thanks for your hard work!

322
00:18:57.804 --> 00:18:59.139
A microwave?

323
00:18:59.306 --> 00:19:01.934
For some reason. it broke yesterday!

324
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.560
So I used expedited delivery.

325
00:19:03.727 --> 00:19:05.521
<i>I can't tell if he's serious or faking it…</i>

326
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:09.608
All right. kid! We're gonna eat those
frozen <i>taiyaki</i> I bought yesterday.

327
00:19:09.775 --> 00:19:12.277
-Get ready!
-We're having <i>taiyaki</i> for breakfast?

328
00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:15.030
I like sweets!

329
00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:23.664
<i>To use One For All like I'm breathing…</i>

330
00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:25.541
<i>Thinking about it objectively.</i>

331
00:19:25.707 --> 00:19:30.003
<i>I have to catch up to the feeling everyone</i>
<i>else had fifteen years to cultivate.</i>

332
00:19:30.754 --> 00:19:32.881
<i>Time waits for no one.</i>

333
00:19:33.924 --> 00:19:37.344
<i>At this rate. in order to draw out</i>
<i>more than five percent of my power.</i>

334
00:19:37.511 --> 00:19:40.097
<i>I'll need as long</i>
<i>as it'd take to build up my body.</i>

335
00:19:41.265 --> 00:19:44.768
Yeah. this is it! Get it while it's hot!

336
00:19:45.143 --> 00:19:46.770
My time is limited…

337
00:19:46.979 --> 00:19:48.230
What should I do?

338
00:19:48.856 --> 00:19:50.607
Why the long face?

339
00:19:50.774 --> 00:19:53.485
For now.
just eat a piping hot <i>taiyaki</i> and…

340
00:19:54.486 --> 00:19:55.362
It's cold!

341
00:19:55.737 --> 00:19:56.905
What? No way!

342
00:19:57.072 --> 00:19:59.575
I microwaved it on defrost. though…

343
00:19:59.741 --> 00:20:02.828
Are you an idiot?
You stuck a huge plate in. didn't you?

344
00:20:03.412 --> 00:20:05.747
If you force a plate
in like that. it won't turn.

345
00:20:05.914 --> 00:20:07.499
so only part of it will get hot.

346
00:20:07.666 --> 00:20:09.376
Is this your first time using a microwave?

347
00:20:09.543 --> 00:20:12.254
Oh. ours wasn't the turning type…

348
00:20:12.713 --> 00:20:13.589
I'm sorr…

349
00:20:17.634 --> 00:20:19.303
I've got it!

350
00:20:19.845 --> 00:20:21.471
Gran Torino!

351
00:20:22.264 --> 00:20:23.140
This…

352
00:20:23.307 --> 00:20:26.018
This <i>taiyaki</i> is… me!

353
00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:28.395
No. it's not. Are you okay?

354
00:20:28.562 --> 00:20:30.147
Oh. no. that's not what I meant.

355
00:20:30.314 --> 00:20:31.732
It's just. I get it now.

356
00:20:32.566 --> 00:20:36.778
Up until now. I've insisted
on "using" One For All.

357
00:20:37.196 --> 00:20:39.948
Using it when I need it.
in the places that need it.

358
00:20:40.741 --> 00:20:42.409
Like flipping on a switch.

359
00:20:42.784 --> 00:20:43.702
But with that.

360
00:20:43.869 --> 00:20:46.455
my reaction time got slower and slower
with the second and third moves.

361
00:20:47.706 --> 00:20:48.582
<i>If that's the case.</i>

362
00:20:48.999 --> 00:20:52.586
<i>then I should've turned the switch on</i>
<i>throughout from the beginning!</i>

363
00:20:53.587 --> 00:20:56.465
<i>Imagining the heat that used</i>
<i>to only be in one place…</i>

364
00:20:57.049 --> 00:20:59.843
<i>spreading throughout my whole body!</i>

365
00:21:01.929 --> 00:21:05.140
<i>It didn't take him long</i>
<i>to figure that out.</i>

366
00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:10.938
<i>In my whole body. continuously!</i>

367
00:21:11.104 --> 00:21:15.025
<i>To the upper limit of</i>
<i>what my body will allow… Five percent!</i>

368
00:21:16.944 --> 00:21:21.532
To visualize a <i>taiyaki</i> in a microwave
is really boring. You okay with that?

369
00:21:21.949 --> 00:21:26.453
All Might's already said… that's fine!

370
00:21:27.246 --> 00:21:29.331
Can you move in that state?

371
00:21:29.873 --> 00:21:31.875
I don't… know…

372
00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:34.920
Wanna give it a try?

373
00:21:37.256 --> 00:21:38.298
Yes.

374
00:21:39.258 --> 00:21:40.676
Please!

375
00:23:13.268 --> 00:23:15.896
<i>You finally called</i>
<i>me for the preview. huh?</i>

376
00:23:16.063 --> 00:23:17.564
<i>Tomura Shigaraki!</i>

377
00:23:17.731 --> 00:23:20.025
<i>It took a long time.</i>
<i>don't you think. Midoriya?</i>

378
00:23:20.651 --> 00:23:22.069
<i>I don't have anything to do with--</i>

379
00:23:22.236 --> 00:23:23.862
<i>Then. starting this week.</i>

380
00:23:24.029 --> 00:23:26.240
<i>I'll be in charge of all the previews.</i>

381
00:23:26.406 --> 00:23:28.367
<i>Help! All Might!</i>

382
00:23:29.117 --> 00:23:31.203
<i>Next time. "Midoriya and Shigaraki."</i>

383
00:23:31.828 --> 00:23:33.705
<i>The League of Villains goes wild.</i>

384
00:23:34.164 --> 00:23:38.418
<i>I'll crush all of you.</i>
<i>whether you're a hero. or a hero killer!</i>

385
00:23:38.585 --> 00:23:40.295
<i>-Go beyond!</i>
<i>-I won't go.</i>

386
00:23:40.462 --> 00:23:42.464
<i>-Go beyond!</i>
<i>-I won't go.</i>
