00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:04.296
<i>The world has become</i>
<i>a superhuman society.</i>

2
00:00:04.463 --> 00:00:08.175
<i>and about 80% of the world's population</i>
<i>now has some kind of special trait.</i>

3
00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:10.093
<i>In this world swirling with chaos.</i>

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.887
<i>the profession that everyone</i>
<i>once dreamed about and admired</i>

5
00:00:12.638 --> 00:00:15.057
<i>came into the limelight.</i>

6
00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:16.517
<i>Heroes of justice</i>

7
00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:19.478
<i>fighting villains</i>
<i>and saving people from distress.</i>

8
00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.606
<i>Yes.</i>

9
00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:26.777
<i>this is the story of how</i>
<i>I became the greatest hero.</i>

10
00:01:59.411 --> 00:02:01.872
The U.A. sports festival is drawing near.

11
00:02:02.664 --> 00:02:04.583
Of course.
joining a famous hero agency

12
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.044
will get you more experience
and popularity.

13
00:02:07.878 --> 00:02:08.961
One chance a year.

14
00:02:09.545 --> 00:02:10.964
A total of just three chances.

15
00:02:11.924 --> 00:02:14.927
No aspiring heroes can afford
to miss this event.

16
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.514
If you understand that.
then don't slack off on your preparations!

17
00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:20.015
Yes. sir!

18
00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:27.981
ROARING SPORTS FESTIVAL

19
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.820
The U.A. sports festival
is something pro heroes.

20
00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:37.908
No. the whole country is watching closely.
A big event!

21
00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.662
That is what I brought
you here to talk about!

22
00:02:42.454 --> 00:02:46.625
The next All Might.
The fledgling Symbol of Peace…

23
00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:48.418
Izuku Midoriya.

24
00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:53.674
I want you to tell the world "I am here!"

25
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.135
"I am here"…

26
00:02:59.137 --> 00:03:01.056
But how?

27
00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:03.892
You know
the sports festival system. right?

28
00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:05.561
Yes. of course!

29
00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:09.439
<i>The support. business. general studies</i>

30
00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:11.441
<i>and hero courses come together</i>

31
00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:14.862
<i>and fight through preliminary games</i>
<i>of different types by class year.</i>

32
00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:17.406
<i>The students who make it through</i>
<i>face off in the finals.</i>

33
00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:21.076
<i>It's a round-robin tournament</i>
<i>divided by grade.</i>

34
00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:22.494
That's right!

35
00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:24.997
In other words. you can sell yourself
with everything you've got!

36
00:03:25.581 --> 00:03:26.582
Right…

37
00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:29.835
I mean.
what you say is absolutely correct!

38
00:03:30.294 --> 00:03:31.295
But honestly.

39
00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:33.964
it's kind of hard to get completely
into it right after what just happened…

40
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.800
Besides. All Might is already teaching me.

41
00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:39.219
so I'm not as motivated
to stand out at the sports festival…

42
00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:42.848
In the first place. I don't think
I <i>can</i> stand out in my current state.

43
00:03:43.015 --> 00:03:44.683
and I did terribly in the fitness tests…

44
00:03:45.184 --> 00:03:48.395
No one's better at spouting
nonsense than you!

45
00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:49.646
Nonsense?

46
00:03:51.023 --> 00:03:54.109
Those who are always aiming
for the top. and those who aren't.

47
00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:56.445
That slight difference in attitudes

48
00:03:56.612 --> 00:03:58.906
will have a big impact
once you go out into society.

49
00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:03.327
I understand how you feel.
and this is more for me than for you.

50
00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:04.745
I won't force you.

51
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.413
However.

52
00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:10.834
I hope you won't forget
how you felt back at the beach park.

53
00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:19.676
Wh…

54
00:04:20.344 --> 00:04:21.678
What's going on?

55
00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:24.056
What business do you have with Class A?

56
00:04:24.223 --> 00:04:25.849
We can't get out!

57
00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:27.226
What'd you come here for. anyway?

58
00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:29.603
Scouting out the enemy. small fry.

59
00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:33.065
We're the ones who made it
out of the villains' attack.

60
00:04:33.232 --> 00:04:35.234
They probably wanna check us out
for the sports festival.

61
00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:38.820
There's no point in doing stuff like that.

62
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.822
Out of my way. extras!

63
00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:43.825
Stop calling people "extras"
just because you don't know them!

64
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.411
I came to see
what the famous Class A was like.

65
00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:50.415
but you seem pretty arrogant.

66
00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:54.211
Are all the students
in the hero course like this?

67
00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:58.882
Seeing something like this
makes me disillusioned.

68
00:05:01.552 --> 00:05:05.097
There are quite a few people who enrolled
in general studies or other courses

69
00:05:05.264 --> 00:05:07.266
because they didn't make it
into the hero course.

70
00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:08.600
Did you know that?

71
00:05:09.268 --> 00:05:12.563
The school has left those of us a chance.

72
00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:15.732
Depending on the results
of the sports festival.

73
00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:18.652
they'll consider our transfer
into the hero course.

74
00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:21.947
And it seems they may
also transfer people out.

75
00:05:23.532 --> 00:05:24.950
Scouting out the enemy?

76
00:05:25.868 --> 00:05:27.494
I. at least. came to say

77
00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:29.121
that even if you're in the hero course.

78
00:05:29.288 --> 00:05:32.249
if you get too carried away.
I'll sweep your feet out from under you.

79
00:05:32.583 --> 00:05:34.668
I came with a declaration of war.

80
00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:37.129
<i>This person's bold. too!</i>

81
00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:41.717
Hey. hey!

82
00:05:42.301 --> 00:05:44.094
I'm from Class B next door!

83
00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:47.764
I heard you fought against villains.
so I came to hear 'bout it!

84
00:05:48.265 --> 00:05:50.726
Don't get so full of yourself!

85
00:05:50.893 --> 00:05:52.519
<i>Another bold person!</i>

86
00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:54.021
If you bark too much.

87
00:05:54.188 --> 00:05:56.190
it'll be embarrassing
for you durin' the real fight!

88
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.691
You ignorin' me. bastard?

89
00:05:57.858 --> 00:06:00.152
Wait a minute. Bakugo!
What're you gonna do about all this?

90
00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:02.988
It's your fault
that everyone's hating on us!

91
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.531
It doesn't matter.

92
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.949
Huh?

93
00:06:06.867 --> 00:06:08.911
It doesn't matter
as long as you rise to the top.

94
00:06:11.914 --> 00:06:13.707
Damnit. you bastard!

95
00:06:15.584 --> 00:06:17.586
That's so simple and manly!

96
00:06:17.753 --> 00:06:19.254
-Huh?
-You said it.

97
00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:21.590
-Huh?
-The top. huh? There is truth in that.

98
00:06:21.757 --> 00:06:22.925
Hang on. don't be tricked!

99
00:06:23.342 --> 00:06:24.801
He just made more pointless enemies!

100
00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:25.844
That's right!

101
00:06:26.345 --> 00:06:29.348
We'll just be at a disadvantage
at the sports festival!

102
00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.184
<i>I'm just…</i>

103
00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:34.561
I'm just getting started!

104
00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:36.021
You hear?

105
00:06:36.188 --> 00:06:39.107
Here. I will become number one!

106
00:06:40.234 --> 00:06:41.318
Kacchan…

107
00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:45.489
Am I… an idiot…?

108
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.407
I'll definitely become

109
00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:50.994
a hero and make money
and let my parents take it easy--

110
00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:54.039
I set my sights on being a hero
because I want to be like my brother--

111
00:06:54.206 --> 00:06:55.457
Time is limited.

112
00:06:55.624 --> 00:06:57.125
If you expect to go pro.
then the path to your future--

113
00:06:57.292 --> 00:06:59.336
That slight difference in attitudes
will have a big impact

114
00:06:59.503 --> 00:07:01.421
once you go out into society.

115
00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:08.011
<i>I hope you won't forget how</i>
<i>you felt</i>

116
00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:10.222
<i>back at the beach park.</i>

117
00:07:16.812 --> 00:07:19.106
DAGOBA MUNICIPAL BEACH PARK

118
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:22.025
<i>The U.A. sports festival is in two weeks.</i>

119
00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:24.027
<i>It'll be broadcast live on TV. too.</i>

120
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.154
<i>There's no doubt</i>

121
00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:30.033
<i>that those who do well have a much better</i>
<i>chance of becoming pro heroes.</i>

122
00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:36.540
<i>We won't know what events we'll</i>
<i>be participating in until the day of.</i>

123
00:07:37.416 --> 00:07:41.003
<i>But I'm sure everyone</i>
<i>has started getting ready.</i>

124
00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:50.971
Ribbit!

125
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:05.694
Here I go!

126
00:08:06.028 --> 00:08:07.070
Release!

127
00:08:11.158 --> 00:08:12.034
Sparkle!

128
00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:30.260
Yes!

129
00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:35.015
Yesh!

130
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.184
Damn it! What the…

131
00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:42.688
Thank you!

132
00:08:50.489 --> 00:08:53.450
<i>Time passed in the blink of an eye.</i>

133
00:08:54.243 --> 00:08:56.828
<i>and the morning</i>
<i>of the sports festival arrived.</i>

134
00:08:58.121 --> 00:09:00.123
Izuku. be careful not to get hurt.

135
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.166
Okay.

136
00:09:01.333 --> 00:09:04.002
I'll record it. okay? In high resolution.

137
00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:05.128
Okay.

138
00:09:05.546 --> 00:09:06.463
Do your best.

139
00:09:07.798 --> 00:09:08.799
I'm off!

140
00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:16.682
The bag check's taking forever.

141
00:09:16.849 --> 00:09:19.059
They <i>were</i> just attacked by villains.

142
00:09:19.226 --> 00:09:21.228
Of course they'll be more strict.

143
00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:24.982
There are people criticizing
their decision to hold it this year.

144
00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:28.068
Controversy equals ratings!

145
00:09:28.694 --> 00:09:31.196
Class 1-A will be the ones
to watch this year. huh?

146
00:09:33.824 --> 00:09:37.452
<i>With the passion of their last chance</i>
<i>and the tactics from their experience.</i>

147
00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:40.080
<i>the third years have always been</i>
<i>the main event in past years…</i>

148
00:09:40.247 --> 00:09:43.625
<i>But this year. the first-year</i>
<i>stage is the one to watch!</i>

149
00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:47.754
<i>Hey. did you know that Endeavor's son</i>
<i>is a first-year this year?</i>

150
00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:49.923
<i>No way. seriously? Wow!</i>

151
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.759
<i>The first-year stage</i>
<i>is gonna be good. huh?</i>

152
00:09:53.886 --> 00:09:55.846
One order of <i>takoyaki</i>. please.

153
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.557
Oh. Mt. Lady!

154
00:09:58.724 --> 00:09:59.933
No green seaweed.

155
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.811
-One. right? That'll be 500 yen.
-Huh?

156
00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:08.025
I don't have that much
on me right now…

157
00:10:08.192 --> 00:10:09.776
That's hot! It's free!

158
00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:11.111
Thanks!

159
00:10:11.278 --> 00:10:12.821
Have you no pride?

160
00:10:12.988 --> 00:10:14.573
PARTICIPANT WAITING ROOMS

161
00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:18.243
I had also hoped to be
able to do some scouting.

162
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.829
We have to work security.
so we don't have a choice.

163
00:10:22.915 --> 00:10:27.669
It looks like they called pro heroes
from all over the country this year.

164
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.715
CLASS 1-A WAITING ROOM

165
00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:33.425
Man…

166
00:10:33.759 --> 00:10:36.136
I wanted to wear my costume.

167
00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:38.972
To keep everything fair. we can't.

168
00:10:39.473 --> 00:10:42.059
I wonder what the first round's gonna be…

169
00:10:42.226 --> 00:10:44.853
No matter what comes. we have
no choice but to deal with it.

170
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.021
Right.

171
00:10:46.188 --> 00:10:48.065
Everyone. are you ready?

172
00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:49.983
We will be entering soon!

173
00:10:50.317 --> 00:10:52.277
Person…

174
00:10:52.444 --> 00:10:53.320
Midoriya.

175
00:10:58.116 --> 00:10:59.952
Todoroki? What is it?

176
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.125
Looking at things objectively.
I think I'm stronger than you.

177
00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:08.168
Huh?

178
00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:09.878
Yeah…

179
00:11:10.462 --> 00:11:14.299
But…
All Might has his eye on you. doesn't he?

180
00:11:15.551 --> 00:11:18.428
I'm not trying to pry about that.

181
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:21.682
But I'm going to beat you.

182
00:11:24.935 --> 00:11:25.811
Oh?

183
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.689
Is the best in the class
making a declaration of war?

184
00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:32.067
Hey. hey. hey! Why are you
picking a fight all of a sudden?

185
00:11:32.234 --> 00:11:33.527
Not now. we're about to start!

186
00:11:33.694 --> 00:11:35.696
We're not here to play at being friends.

187
00:11:36.113 --> 00:11:37.447
So what does it matter?

188
00:11:40.534 --> 00:11:41.410
Todoroki.

189
00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:46.123
I don't know what you're thinking
when you say you'll beat me.

190
00:11:46.999 --> 00:11:49.418
but of course you're better than me.

191
00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:50.794
I think

192
00:11:51.837 --> 00:11:53.797
you're more capable
than most people…

193
00:11:54.506 --> 00:11:55.966
Looking at it objectively…

194
00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:59.469
Midoriya. you probably
shouldn't talk so negatively--

195
00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:01.597
But. everyone.

196
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:03.807
The students from the other
courses are aiming

197
00:12:03.974 --> 00:12:06.018
for the top with everything they've got!

198
00:12:06.727 --> 00:12:08.645
I want to become the greatest hero!

199
00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:14.526
I can't afford to fall behind.

200
00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:22.034
I'll be going for it
with everything I have. too.

201
00:12:23.619 --> 00:12:24.578
Yeah.

202
00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:32.836
<i>Hey!</i>

203
00:12:33.462 --> 00:12:35.631
<i>Pay attention. audience!</i>

204
00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:38.592
<i>Swarm. mass media!</i>

205
00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:40.594
<i>This year's high school rodeo</i>

206
00:12:40.761 --> 00:12:43.889
of adolescence that you all love.

207
00:12:44.056 --> 00:12:45.933
the U.A. sports festival.
is about to begin!

208
00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:48.519
Everybody. are you ready?

209
00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:52.022
<i>It's time for the students</i>
<i>to enter the first-year stage!</i>

210
00:12:55.317 --> 00:12:56.401
Izuku…

211
00:13:02.199 --> 00:13:06.495
<i>I want you to tell the world "I am here!"</i>

212
00:13:10.082 --> 00:13:12.626
Roger that. All Might!

213
00:13:16.213 --> 00:13:18.465
<i>The U.A. sports festival!</i>

214
00:13:18.632 --> 00:13:24.346
<i>The huge battle where fledgling heroes</i>
<i>sharpen their swords once a year!</i>

215
00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:27.015
<i>Anyway. these are the guys. right?</i>

216
00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:33.230
<i>The miraculous new stars who overcame</i>
<i>enemy attacks with their hearts of steel!</i>

217
00:13:33.772 --> 00:13:36.775
<i>Hero course. Class 1-A. right?</i>

218
00:13:41.947 --> 00:13:43.866
There are so many people…

219
00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:45.993
Will we be able
to give our best performance

220
00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:48.370
being watched by so many people?

221
00:13:48.787 --> 00:13:52.749
This is also part of the training
required to become a hero.

222
00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:55.252
Man. he's going overboard
with that praise!

223
00:13:55.752 --> 00:13:58.255
I'm getting nervous!
Aren't you. Bakugo?

224
00:13:58.422 --> 00:14:01.508
No. I'm just getting more into it.

225
00:14:01.884 --> 00:14:04.386
<i>They haven't been getting as much airtime.</i>

226
00:14:04.553 --> 00:14:06.972
<i>but this class is also full of talent!</i>

227
00:14:07.139 --> 00:14:10.225
<i>Hero course. Class 1-B!</i>

228
00:14:10.601 --> 00:14:14.646
<i>Next up. general studies</i>
<i>Classes C. D. and E!</i>

229
00:14:14.813 --> 00:14:17.941
<i>Support course. Classes F.</i>
<i>G. and H are here. too!</i>

230
00:14:18.108 --> 00:14:21.528
<i>And business course. Classes I. J. and K!</i>

231
00:14:22.154 --> 00:14:25.324
<i>All of U.A.'s first years are here now!</i>

232
00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:29.244
We're just here to make
those guys look better. huh?

233
00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:31.121
I'm not really feeling it…

234
00:14:34.917 --> 00:14:36.293
Time for the player pledge!

235
00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:43.133
This year's chief umpire for the
first years is the R-Rated Hero. Midnight?

236
00:14:44.176 --> 00:14:45.052
What about the principal?

237
00:14:45.219 --> 00:14:47.471
The principal is at the third-year stage
every year.

238
00:14:47.888 --> 00:14:50.641
What is Ms. Midnight wearing?

239
00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:52.601
That's an R-Rated Hero for you.

240
00:14:52.768 --> 00:14:55.479
Is it okay for her to be at a high school
even though she's R-Rated?

241
00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:56.688
Yes!

242
00:14:56.855 --> 00:14:58.232
<i>Quiet. everyone!</i>

243
00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:01.485
<i>Representing the students is</i>

244
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:03.570
<i>Katsuki Bakugo from Class 1-A!</i>

245
00:15:05.989 --> 00:15:07.741
What? It's Kacchan?

246
00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:11.245
That guy <i>did</i> finish first
in the entrance exam.

247
00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:14.331
In the <i>hero</i> course.

248
00:15:14.665 --> 00:15:17.835
Right.
It's obvious she hates us.

249
00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:21.380
And it's all Bakugo's fault.

250
00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:33.559
<i>I pledge</i>

251
00:15:34.351 --> 00:15:35.769
<i>that I'll be number one.</i>

252
00:15:35.936 --> 00:15:38.397
<i>I knew he'd do that!</i>

253
00:15:38.564 --> 00:15:39.815
-What the heck!
-Stop messing around!

254
00:15:39.982 --> 00:15:41.942
-Don't be so full of yourselves. Class A!
-You sludge bastard!

255
00:15:42.109 --> 00:15:44.820
Why are you doing
something so disgraceful?

256
00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:48.073
At least become a nice bouncy
step for me to jump off of.

257
00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.325
How overconfident can you get?

258
00:15:50.868 --> 00:15:52.953
I'll crush you!

259
00:15:53.328 --> 00:15:55.914
<i>Confidence? No…</i>

260
00:15:56.373 --> 00:15:59.668
<i>The old Kacchan would've</i>
<i>laughed while saying that.</i>

261
00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:03.255
<i>He's driving himself into a corner.</i>

262
00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:09.887
<i>Getting the rest of us caught up in it</i>
<i>is just like Kacchan. though.</i>

263
00:16:12.014 --> 00:16:14.725
<i>Now. let's get started right away.</i>

264
00:16:15.142 --> 00:16:17.728
U.A. does everything "right away." huh?

265
00:16:18.103 --> 00:16:20.981
<i>Every year. many drink their tears here!</i>

266
00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:24.276
<i>Now. here is the fateful first game!</i>

267
00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.654
<i>This year. it's…</i>

268
00:16:30.282 --> 00:16:31.158
<i>This!</i>

269
00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:33.744
An obstacle course race.

270
00:16:34.244 --> 00:16:37.456
<i>All 11 classes</i>
<i>will participate in this race.</i>

271
00:16:37.623 --> 00:16:40.959
<i>The course will be the outer circumference</i>
<i>of this stadium about four kilometers!</i>

272
00:16:42.461 --> 00:16:45.005
<i>Our school's selling point is freedom!</i>

273
00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:48.926
<i>As long as you stay on the course.</i>

274
00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:51.553
<i>it doesn't matter what you do!</i>

275
00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:55.849
<i>Now. take your places everyone!</i>

276
00:17:03.649 --> 00:17:04.650
<i>All Might…</i>

277
00:17:05.776 --> 00:17:09.738
<i>I want you to tell the world "I am here!"</i>

278
00:17:10.948 --> 00:17:12.907
<i>Thinking about it realistically.</i>

279
00:17:13.075 --> 00:17:15.911
<i>without really being able</i>
<i>to regulate One For All…</i>

280
00:17:16.494 --> 00:17:18.497
<i>That's too unreasonable…</i>

281
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.710
<i>That's why I have to go beyond.</i>

282
00:17:29.258 --> 00:17:30.592
<i>Please watch me!</i>

283
00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:33.428
<i>Start!</i>

284
00:17:37.808 --> 00:17:40.310
Okay. here's the play-by-play!

285
00:17:40.477 --> 00:17:42.855
Are you ready to do the
commentary. Mummy Man?

286
00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:44.898
You're the one who forced me to come.

287
00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:47.025
<i>Let's get started right away. Mummy Man.</i>

288
00:17:47.192 --> 00:17:48.277
<i>What should we pay attention</i>
<i>to in the early stages?</i>

289
00:17:49.236 --> 00:17:50.529
This part right now.

290
00:17:50.696 --> 00:17:51.947
-Hey. hey!
-This is too narrow!

291
00:17:52.114 --> 00:17:54.032
-Ouch!
-Hey. move!

292
00:17:59.538 --> 00:18:00.539
<i>I see…</i>

293
00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:03.625
<i>This means. from the start. it's already…</i>

294
00:18:04.001 --> 00:18:05.627
<i>The first sifting.</i>

295
00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:13.218
<i>Sorry. but…</i>

296
00:18:13.385 --> 00:18:15.179
-Ow! What the--
-It's freezing over! I can't move!

297
00:18:15.345 --> 00:18:16.763
-So cold!
-Outta the way! I can't get it off!

298
00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:21.852
Take that!

299
00:18:22.269 --> 00:18:23.562
Naive. Todoroki!

300
00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:27.441
I won't let you get away so easily!

301
00:18:27.608 --> 00:18:29.526
You half-and-half bastard!

302
00:18:31.195 --> 00:18:34.031
You got me with that once.
You won't get me again!

303
00:18:34.198 --> 00:18:35.657
Woah. that was close!

304
00:18:41.288 --> 00:18:44.416
I can't use my special move yet…

305
00:18:46.752 --> 00:18:48.879
They're used to using their Quirks. huh…

306
00:18:49.755 --> 00:18:53.717
More people outside of Class A
were able to dodge that than I expected…

307
00:18:59.723 --> 00:19:02.309
I've outwitted you. Todoroki!

308
00:19:02.893 --> 00:19:04.311
How pathetic!

309
00:19:05.103 --> 00:19:07.731
Take this! My special attack!

310
00:19:08.482 --> 00:19:09.983
Gra…

311
00:19:16.532 --> 00:19:17.449
Mineta!

312
00:19:20.661 --> 00:19:21.703
<i>Targets found…</i>

313
00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:23.914
<i>Lots!</i>

314
00:19:24.414 --> 00:19:27.042
The faux villains from the entrance exam?

315
00:19:27.209 --> 00:19:30.045
<i>Obstacles have shown up suddenly!</i>

316
00:19:30.462 --> 00:19:31.713
Starting with…

317
00:19:32.506 --> 00:19:34.633
<i>The first barrier!</i>

318
00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.846
<i>Robo Inferno!</i>

319
00:19:42.558 --> 00:19:44.893
Aren't those the zero-point villains
from the entrance exam?

320
00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.230
-Seriously?
-This is what they meant by obstacles?

321
00:19:48.397 --> 00:19:51.608
So this is what they used
in the general entrance exam?

322
00:19:52.109 --> 00:19:54.528
I wonder where they got the money for it?

323
00:19:57.906 --> 00:19:59.408
<i>If they went through all this trouble.</i>

324
00:19:59.575 --> 00:20:02.578
<i>I wish they would've prepared</i>
<i>something better.</i>

325
00:20:06.999 --> 00:20:09.209
Since my stupid old man is watching.

326
00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:29.438
He stopped them!

327
00:20:29.605 --> 00:20:31.648
Between their legs! We can get through!

328
00:20:32.107 --> 00:20:33.025
I wouldn't if I were you.

329
00:20:33.192 --> 00:20:35.861
I froze them when they were unbalanced.

330
00:20:37.905 --> 00:20:39.281
They'll fall over.

331
00:20:42.701 --> 00:20:44.119
<i>Todoroki from Class 1-A!</i>

332
00:20:44.286 --> 00:20:46.413
<i>He attacked and defended in one hit!</i>

333
00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.457
<i>How elegant!</i>

334
00:20:48.624 --> 00:20:50.959
Amazing! He's the first one through!

335
00:20:51.126 --> 00:20:53.629
It's. you know. practically unfair!

336
00:20:53.795 --> 00:20:56.256
His actions are logical and strategic.

337
00:20:56.423 --> 00:20:58.800
As expected of someone
who got in through recommendations!

338
00:20:59.301 --> 00:21:01.553
<i>He'd never fought them before.</i>

339
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.765
<i>but those Robo Infernos couldn't</i>
<i>get past his elite moves!</i>

340
00:21:14.858 --> 00:21:15.943
<i>Gotta hurry!</i>

341
00:21:17.486 --> 00:21:19.446
You can't beat those.

342
00:21:20.072 --> 00:21:20.989
Run…

343
00:21:21.532 --> 00:21:23.992
Run away. Izuku!

344
00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.579
<i>I have to get past these robots</i>
<i>while also paying attention</i>

345
00:21:27.746 --> 00:21:29.331
<i>to the obstacles around me.</i>

346
00:21:30.832 --> 00:21:31.959
<i>Idiot. why?</i>

347
00:21:32.417 --> 00:21:34.211
<i>Why can't I move?</i>

348
00:21:37.172 --> 00:21:38.799
