1
00:00:02.127 --> 00:00:04.129
<i>The world has become a superhuman society.</i>

2
00:00:04.296 --> 00:00:07.966
<i>and about 80% of the world's population</i>
<i>now has some kind of special trait.</i>

3
00:00:08.217 --> 00:00:10.093
<i>In this world swirling with chaos.</i>

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.180
<i>the profession that everyone</i>
<i>once dreamed about and admired</i>

5
00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:15.098
<i>came into the limelight.</i>

6
00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:19.478
<i>Heroes of justice fighting villains</i>
<i>and saving people from distress.</i>

7
00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:26.485
<i>Yes. this is the story</i>
<i>of how I became the greatest hero.</i>

8
00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:02.497
I'll definitely become a hero
and make money

9
00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:06.001
and let my parents take it easy.

10
00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:08.544
You're amazing. Deku.

11
00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:10.631
I keep seeing more and more
amazing sides to you.

12
00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:12.424
<i>During the cavalry battle.</i>

13
00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:16.094
<i>I thought</i>
<i>it'd be easier to team up with friends.</i>

14
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:19.973
<i>but now that I think about it.</i>
<i>I might've been trying to rely on you.</i>

15
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:24.520
That's why. when Iida
said he'd challenge you.

16
00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:27.272
it actually made me feel
a little embarrassed.

17
00:02:28.607 --> 00:02:29.942
Uraraka…

18
00:02:31.777 --> 00:02:34.821
Everyone's facing the future
and trying their hardest.

19
00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.825
That means we're all rivals. right?

20
00:02:39.952 --> 00:02:40.827
That's why…

21
00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:45.165
Let's meet in the finals!

22
00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:49.503
BAKUGO VS. URARAKA

23
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.506
<i>The eighth</i>
<i>and last match of the first round!</i>

24
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.551
<i>He was kind of famous in middle school!</i>

25
00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:57.344
<i>This isn't the face of a regular person!</i>

26
00:02:57.511 --> 00:03:00.097
<i>From the hero course. it's Katsuki Bakugo!</i>

27
00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:01.431
<i>Versus…</i>

28
00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:03.517
<i>She's the one I'm rooting for!</i>

29
00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:06.103
<i>From the hero course. it's Ochaco Uraraka!</i>

30
00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:12.276
You're the one that makes
things float. right. Round Face?

31
00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:13.735
Round…

32
00:03:14.236 --> 00:03:16.029
If you're gonna withdraw. do it now.

33
00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:18.073
You won't get off with just an "ouch."

34
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.329
Midoriya.

35
00:03:25.581 --> 00:03:27.666
What was the strategy
you were going to tell

36
00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:30.252
Uraraka earlier for her
to use against Bakugo?

37
00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:32.963
It wasn't much. really.

38
00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:35.299
Kacchan's strong.

39
00:03:36.008 --> 00:03:39.136
<i>In a real close combat fight.</i>
<i>he has almost no openings.</i>

40
00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:44.057
<i>and the more he moves. the more he sweats.</i>
<i>making his Explosion Quirk stronger.</i>

41
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.603
He can use the blasts from his explosions
to move around in the air.

42
00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:53.150
<i>but if Uraraka touches Kacchan</i>
<i>and uses her Quirk to make him float.</i>

43
00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:56.236
<i>then she would have the upper hand.</i>

44
00:03:57.321 --> 00:03:58.197
That's why…

45
00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:01.658
the first thing Uraraka should do is…

46
00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:05.787
Eighth match. start!

47
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:08.582
…a swift attack!

48
00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:10.459
Withdrawing isn't a choice!

49
00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.127
All right! That's good.

50
00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:15.172
Even if it's an accident. as long as
she can touch him. she can make him float!

51
00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:19.384
Bakugo won't want Uraraka
to get close to him.

52
00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:23.263
That's why Kacchan won't want to evade.
He'll want to counterattack!

53
00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:25.849
Then. die!

54
00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:28.060
<i>Kacchan…</i>

55
00:04:28.227 --> 00:04:31.146
<i>You usually start with a big right swing.</i>

56
00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:36.318
<i>Here!</i>

57
00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:39.571
<i>Here…</i>

58
00:04:41.657 --> 00:04:43.408
<i>If I dodge here…</i>

59
00:04:47.246 --> 00:04:48.121
Uraraka!

60
00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.207
Did he blast her?

61
00:04:50.374 --> 00:04:53.877
Even though you're fighting a girl.
you have no mercy. do you. Bakugo?

62
00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:55.879
This is no good.

63
00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:58.173
Even if I knew about it.
I couldn't react in time.

64
00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.219
I'll take care of you.

65
00:05:04.847 --> 00:05:06.807
Don't underestimate me!

66
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:14.565
<i>She made her jacket float</i>
<i>and sent it over there?</i>

67
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.900
<i>She did it in an instant. too!</i>

68
00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:19.528
<i>If I make him float now…</i>

69
00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:26.493
He moved after he saw her?

70
00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:29.997
With that reaction time. it doesn't
matter if there's a smokescreen.

71
00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:33.000
With Uraraka not being able to activate
her Quirk unless she touches him.

72
00:05:33.584 --> 00:05:36.837
she's at a disadvantage
with Bakugo's reflexes.

73
00:05:39.173 --> 00:05:40.257
Too slow!

74
00:05:48.307 --> 00:05:49.683
Take this!

75
00:05:52.895 --> 00:05:53.937
Ochaco…

76
00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:55.564
I can't watch!

77
00:05:56.398 --> 00:06:00.027
Bakugo. don't tell me…
your tastes run in <i>that</i> direction…

78
00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:06.074
Not yet!

79
00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:19.379
Uraraka keeps attacking
without rest. but… this is…

80
00:06:22.883 --> 00:06:24.218
Uraraka…

81
00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:29.014
Her substitution earlier didn't work.
so she's getting desperate.

82
00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:32.559
What an idiot.

83
00:06:35.938 --> 00:06:37.773
Hey. shouldn't you stop this?

84
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.525
<i>Isn't he going too far?</i>

85
00:06:44.363 --> 00:06:45.405
I can't watch.

86
00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:47.950
Hey! How can you say you
want to be a hero like that?

87
00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:49.493
If there's such a huge
difference in your abilities.

88
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.454
then hurry up and send her out of bounds!

89
00:06:54.706 --> 00:06:56.875
Stop bullying
and playing with the poor girl!

90
00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:58.377
Yeah!

91
00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:02.881
<i>There's booing from part of the crowd…</i>

92
00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:05.425
But honestly. I also feel the sa--

93
00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.886
An elbow? What're ya doin'?

94
00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:10.556
Was that a pro saying he's playing around?

95
00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:12.474
-How many years have you been a pro?
-Huh?

96
00:07:13.267 --> 00:07:14.726
<i>If you're saying that</i>
<i>with a straight face.</i>

97
00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:16.478
<i>there's no point in you</i>
<i>watching anymore. so go home!</i>

98
00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:20.023
Go home. and look into changing careers!

99
00:07:20.983 --> 00:07:22.734
Mr. Aizawa?

100
00:07:24.027 --> 00:07:27.948
<i>Bakugo is being careful because he's</i>
<i>acknowledged the strength of his opponent</i>

101
00:07:28.115 --> 00:07:29.408
<i>who has made it this far.</i>

102
00:07:30.158 --> 00:07:32.286
<i>It's because he's doing</i>
<i>everything he can to win</i>

103
00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:35.122
<i>that he can't go easy on her</i>
<i>or let his guard down.</i>

104
00:07:38.417 --> 00:07:39.543
Not yet…

105
00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:41.170
She's still…

106
00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:44.214
not dead!

107
00:07:45.549 --> 00:07:48.051
It's about time… I think…

108
00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:51.847
Thanks. Bakugo…

109
00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:56.518
for not letting your guard down.

110
00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:57.895
Huh?

111
00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.897
It can't be helped from where Bakugo is.

112
00:08:00.564 --> 00:08:05.152
but it's embarrassing for a pro in the
stands to start booing without noticing.

113
00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:08.113
<i>She kept her body low as she advanced.</i>

114
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.240
<i>concentrating</i>
<i>Bakugo's attacks on the ground.</i>

115
00:08:10.407 --> 00:08:11.867
<i>storing up weapons.</i>

116
00:08:12.743 --> 00:08:13.619
<i>And then.</i>

117
00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:17.623
she narrowed his field
of vision with relentless attacks

118
00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:20.250
to keep him from noticing.

119
00:08:23.504 --> 00:08:25.714
I'm gonna win!

120
00:08:32.763 --> 00:08:33.931
A meteor shower?

121
00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:34.972
You should've noticed.

122
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.975
She had a desperate plan
like that up her sleeve?

123
00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:42.063
<i>With this much debris.</i>

124
00:08:42.231 --> 00:08:44.024
<i>whether he's evading or counterattacking.</i>

125
00:08:44.191 --> 00:08:45.692
<i>there will definitely be an opening!</i>

126
00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:50.239
<i>In that moment. I'll get close</i>
<i>to him with my secret move!</i>

127
00:08:53.367 --> 00:08:57.329
<i>I'll win! I'll win and be like Deku. too!</i>

128
00:09:25.566 --> 00:09:28.694
Since you're friends with Deku.

129
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.823
I thought you'd be up to something…

130
00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:36.159
In one shot…

131
00:09:37.703 --> 00:09:40.789
<i>Bakugo delivers a satisfying explosion!</i>

132
00:09:40.956 --> 00:09:45.335
<i>He blasts boldly through</i>
<i>Uraraka's secret plan!</i>

133
00:09:48.964 --> 00:09:50.591
That was close…

134
00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:54.469
<i>I did as much as I could…</i>

135
00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:57.973
<i>But he wasn't fazed at all.</i>

136
00:09:58.724 --> 00:10:00.142
<i>Uraraka…</i>

137
00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:04.855
<i>Even so…</i>

138
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:09.568
All right. let's get serious then.

139
00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:11.570
Uraraka!

140
00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:14.781
<i>If it were Deku…</i>

141
00:10:15.908 --> 00:10:17.910
he wouldn't give up…

142
00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:29.254
<i>Uraraka's down!</i>

143
00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:36.345
My… body… won't do… what I want…

144
00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:38.722
Uraraka…

145
00:10:38.889 --> 00:10:41.892
She passed her limit a long time ago.

146
00:10:45.229 --> 00:10:46.897
I also…

147
00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:49.483
also…

148
00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:52.903
can still…

149
00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:55.989
<i>When I get big.</i>

150
00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:58.742
I'll help you and Mommy!

151
00:11:01.078 --> 00:11:03.664
I appreciate the thought. Ochaco.

152
00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:08.502
But as your dad. I'd be even happier
if you could achieve your dream.

153
00:11:08.877 --> 00:11:09.837
When that happens.

154
00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:12.214
<i>you can take us to Hawaii!</i>

155
00:11:14.967 --> 00:11:18.303
I'll become… a hero…

156
00:11:23.809 --> 00:11:25.060
Daddy…

157
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.148
<i>Uraraka's out of commission.</i>

158
00:11:30.858 --> 00:11:33.151
<i>Bakugo advances to the second round!</i>

159
00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:40.909
KATSUKI BAKUGO

160
00:11:41.535 --> 00:11:43.161
Take her to Recovery Girl.

161
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.038
<i>I know.</i>

162
00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:51.336
<i>The eighth match of the first round…</i>

163
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.463
Oh. Uraraka…

164
00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:56.633
<i>Oh yeah.</i>
<i>Bakugo advances to the second round.</i>

165
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.594
<i>If you're gonna do it. do it properly.</i>

166
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.096
<i>Now. let's pull ourselves together--</i>

167
00:12:01.263 --> 00:12:02.181
<i>You're really letting</i>
<i>your personal feelings take over…</i>

168
00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:04.558
<i>The first round is all done!</i>

169
00:12:04.975 --> 00:12:08.187
<i>Let's move on to the next round</i>
<i>quickly after a short break!</i>

170
00:12:09.688 --> 00:12:11.648
PLAYER WAITING ROOM 2

171
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.236
Let's meet in the finals!

172
00:12:18.405 --> 00:12:19.448
<i>Uraraka…</i>

173
00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:25.537
Whoa. Kacchan?

174
00:12:25.704 --> 00:12:27.372
What the… What the hell do you want?
Die. scum!

175
00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:29.791
Oh. well. I'm next. so…

176
00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.752
I was going to get ready
in the waiting room…

177
00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:34.463
Also. congrats on winning the first round…

178
00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:35.797
Later…

179
00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:38.133
That was your idea. wasn't it?

180
00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:41.136
That damned desperate plan.

181
00:12:41.845 --> 00:12:44.515
You just have to be annoying.
don't you? What the hell--

182
00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:45.641
It wasn't.

183
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.227
All of it…

184
00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:51.772
Uraraka planned it all thinking
about how she could beat you.

185
00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:54.858
If you thought that was
annoying. that was because…

186
00:12:55.651 --> 00:12:58.362
Uraraka was leading
you around by the nose!

187
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:04.618
Hey. Bakugo!

188
00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:07.663
That was tough. huh? Playing the bad guy.

189
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:12.668
Even if it was because of the match-up.
you played an amazing villain. Bakugo.

190
00:13:12.835 --> 00:13:15.045
Shut up! Be quiet!

191
00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:20.425
But man. I can't believe you were able
to aim such a huge blast at a frail girl.

192
00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:22.803
I couldn't help but hold back.

193
00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.472
She completely sealed you off. Kaminari.

194
00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:27.891
You know what. Tsu…

195
00:13:30.519 --> 00:13:32.771
What part of her was frail?

196
00:13:36.108 --> 00:13:38.193
PLAYER WAITING ROOM 2

197
00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.696
Man. I lost…

198
00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:43.490
Huh…

199
00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:49.454
I got carried away at the end
thinking I could do it. dang it.

200
00:13:49.955 --> 00:13:52.666
Uraraka. what about your injuries?
Are you okay?

201
00:13:53.125 --> 00:13:55.502
Yeah. Recovery Girl took care of me!

202
00:13:55.669 --> 00:13:58.130
It was only moderate healing
so it wouldn't drain my stamina.

203
00:13:58.297 --> 00:14:00.591
so I've still got scratches
and stuff. though.

204
00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:04.219
Man. but that Bakugo was really strong!

205
00:14:04.386 --> 00:14:05.929
He totally got me.

206
00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:08.974
I need to work harder. too!

207
00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:13.562
Are you all right?

208
00:14:13.729 --> 00:14:15.981
I'm fine! Better than expected!

209
00:14:16.148 --> 00:14:17.357
DADDY

210
00:14:18.483 --> 00:14:21.820
I mean. you immediately
started looking ahead. Deku.

211
00:14:22.112 --> 00:14:24.072
and just because I lost
doesn't mean I can lose.

212
00:14:24.239 --> 00:14:25.407
That's…

213
00:14:27.284 --> 00:14:30.162
<i>The draw from the seventh match</i>
<i>of the first round.</i>

214
00:14:30.329 --> 00:14:32.706
<i>Kirishima and Tetsutetsu!</i>

215
00:14:32.873 --> 00:14:34.333
<i>The winner of their arm wrestling match</i>

216
00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:37.628
<i>to decide</i>
<i>who advances to the second round is…</i>

217
00:14:44.176 --> 00:14:45.677
<i>Winner. Kirishima!</i>

218
00:14:45.844 --> 00:14:47.137
<i>He advances to the second round!</i>

219
00:14:47.304 --> 00:14:50.891
-Yes!
-<i>The one who won his ticket was Kirishima!</i>

220
00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:53.560
My metal fatigue…

221
00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:56.230
I should've eaten more iron!

222
00:14:58.607 --> 00:15:01.026
It was a good match.

223
00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:05.697
So youthful!

224
00:15:05.864 --> 00:15:09.159
<i>Now we've got everyone</i>
<i>who's advancing to the second round!</i>

225
00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:12.162
So. let's get started!

226
00:15:12.704 --> 00:15:14.164
Already?

227
00:15:14.915 --> 00:15:15.791
Later…

228
00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.751
Oh. sorry Deku!

229
00:15:17.918 --> 00:15:19.962
You weren't able to prepare
at all since I was here.

230
00:15:20.128 --> 00:15:21.505
No. I'm fine.

231
00:15:23.799 --> 00:15:25.843
I'll be watching. 'kay? Good luck.

232
00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:28.136
Thanks.

233
00:15:40.941 --> 00:15:43.569
Sorry about not picking up earlier. Daddy.

234
00:15:43.735 --> 00:15:46.738
<i>It's fine. sorry for calling</i>
<i>when you're busy.</i>

235
00:15:46.905 --> 00:15:48.824
<i>Your mom and I watched you on TV.</i>

236
00:15:49.283 --> 00:15:50.367
<i>You were so close!</i>

237
00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:52.077
<i>But you were amazing!</i>

238
00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:54.246
It wasn't that close.

239
00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:55.998
And I wasn't amazing.

240
00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:57.875
I rushed too much in the end. too.

241
00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:02.588
I didn't have a plan
for what to do after that. either.

242
00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:06.425
I was completely beaten.

243
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.135
<i>Is that so?</i>

244
00:16:08.302 --> 00:16:10.596
<i>I don't understand complicated things.</i>

245
00:16:10.762 --> 00:16:14.725
<i>but just because you lost doesn't</i>
<i>mean your path's been closed off. right?</i>

246
00:16:14.892 --> 00:16:16.518
<i>There's always next year. right?</i>

247
00:16:17.853 --> 00:16:19.605
The further you advance.

248
00:16:19.771 --> 00:16:22.482
the more you can show how well
you do against different types.

249
00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:25.777
The scouts can't tell with just one match.

250
00:16:26.403 --> 00:16:28.530
<i>What're you in such a hurry for?</i>

251
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.325
I mean…

252
00:16:32.075 --> 00:16:34.536
I want to hurry and help you guys…

253
00:16:36.747 --> 00:16:40.709
<i>Ochaco. it's fine even if you don't rush.</i>

254
00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:46.548
<i>You feeling that way shows you're kind.</i>

255
00:16:46.715 --> 00:16:49.968
<i>so I know you'll be a great hero.</i>

256
00:16:59.436 --> 00:17:00.938
<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>

257
00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:03.982
<i>There's no way she's not frustrated.</i>

258
00:17:04.191 --> 00:17:06.401
<i>Even so. I can't believe</i>
<i>I said that I could help…</i>

259
00:17:07.152 --> 00:17:09.320
<i>I couldn't do anything for her.</i>

260
00:17:10.571 --> 00:17:11.990
<i>Instead…</i>

261
00:17:12.699 --> 00:17:15.117
I'll be watching. 'kay? Good luck.

262
00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:19.289
<i>…</i>she<i> encouraged </i>me<i> again.</i>

263
00:17:28.924 --> 00:17:30.425
Endeavor?

264
00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:32.386
Oh. there you are.

265
00:17:32.553 --> 00:17:35.889
Endeavor… What are you doing here?

266
00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.476
I watched your fight.

267
00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:41.854
You have a wonderful Quirk.

268
00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:45.148
You created so much wind pressure
just by flicking your fingers.

269
00:17:45.774 --> 00:17:48.026
If we're talking about power alone.

270
00:17:48.318 --> 00:17:50.863
yours is comparable to All Might's.

271
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:53.532
What are you…

272
00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:56.326
What are you trying to say?

273
00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.370
I must go.

274
00:17:59.121 --> 00:18:02.249
<i>Endeavor knows about One For All?</i>

275
00:18:02.416 --> 00:18:05.377
<i>No. from the way he talked.</i>
<i>he doesn't know.</i>

276
00:18:05.544 --> 00:18:08.046
<i>Anyway. this is the one person</i>
<i>I can't let find out.</i>

277
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:12.843
It is my Shoto's duty
to surpass All Might.

278
00:18:14.428 --> 00:18:19.099
His match with you will be
a very instructive test bed.

279
00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:24.980
Please don't disgrace yourself in it.

280
00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.984
<i>Without using my damn old man's Quirk…</i>

281
00:18:30.235 --> 00:18:31.111
No…

282
00:18:32.154 --> 00:18:37.159
I'll reject him completely
by winning first place without using it.

283
00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:40.204
That was all I wanted to say.

284
00:18:40.454 --> 00:18:42.206
I apologize for bothering
you right before the match.

285
00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:45.167
I…

286
00:18:45.918 --> 00:18:47.544
am not All Might.

287
00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:49.213
That's obviou--

288
00:18:49.379 --> 00:18:51.256
That's obvious. right?

289
00:18:52.674 --> 00:18:55.594
Todoroki isn't you. either.

290
00:19:05.437 --> 00:19:09.066
<i>All Might has his eye on you. doesn't he?</i>

291
00:19:10.901 --> 00:19:12.319
<i>Todoroki…</i>

292
00:19:14.321 --> 00:19:18.283
<i>It is my Shoto's duty</i>
<i>to surpass All Might.</i>

293
00:19:19.785 --> 00:19:21.078
<i>Midoriya…</i>

294
00:19:22.746 --> 00:19:24.540
<i>Just remember this…</i>

295
00:19:25.415 --> 00:19:30.254
<i>I will make that into a hero</i>
<i>that will surpass you one day.</i>

296
00:19:35.884 --> 00:19:37.761
Those two haven't started yet?

297
00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:41.431
I've gotta watch.

298
00:19:41.598 --> 00:19:42.808
Were your eyes hurt?

299
00:19:42.975 --> 00:19:44.643
You must hurry to Recovery Girl!

300
00:19:45.018 --> 00:19:46.311
I already went.

301
00:19:46.478 --> 00:19:48.230
This is. you know… It's different.

302
00:19:48.397 --> 00:19:49.606
It's different?

303
00:19:50.858 --> 00:19:53.652
If that's the case. then you must've been
really frustrated earlier.

304
00:19:53.819 --> 00:19:55.612
Rather than feeling regretful right now.

305
00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:58.031
you should use this next match
as a source of encouragement.

306
00:19:58.198 --> 00:19:59.366
Yeah.

307
00:19:59.533 --> 00:20:00.492
That's true.

308
00:20:02.703 --> 00:20:04.997
<i>Thanks for waiting. everybody!</i>

309
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:08.709
The first match of the second round
is a big match!

310
00:20:09.251 --> 00:20:11.211
<i>The man who won a huge victory</i>
<i>in the first round</i>

311
00:20:11.378 --> 00:20:13.172
<i>and literally left the audience frozen…</i>

312
00:20:13.881 --> 00:20:16.216
<i>From the hero course. it's Shoto Todoroki!</i>

313
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.803
<i>On the other hand. this guy</i>
<i>barely made it past the first round!</i>

314
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.723
<i>What kind of fight</i>
<i>will he show us this time?</i>

315
00:20:23.182 --> 00:20:26.101
<i>From the hero course. it's Izuku Midoriya!</i>

316
00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:30.731
So you're here.

317
00:20:32.024 --> 00:20:33.233
Todoroki.

318
00:20:37.279 --> 00:20:39.907
Tokoyami. what do you think of this match?

319
00:20:40.365 --> 00:20:43.702
It depends on whether or not
Midoriya jumps in close to Todoroki.

320
00:20:43.869 --> 00:20:47.915
Yeah. What is Deku
going to do about that ice?

321
00:20:51.752 --> 00:20:54.880
Watch carefully and prepare.
Tomura Shigaraki.

322
00:20:55.506 --> 00:20:59.343
They may become obstacles to you one day.

323
00:21:00.928 --> 00:21:03.180
That's a load of crap.

324
00:21:06.642 --> 00:21:08.769
Izuku…

325
00:21:10.812 --> 00:21:12.272
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

326
00:21:12.814 --> 00:21:17.027
<i>Those two both tried</i>
<i>to save you. didn't they?</i>

327
00:21:17.194 --> 00:21:18.070
Yeah.

328
00:21:19.404 --> 00:21:21.657
<i>It's just a feeling.</i>
<i>but I think those two…</i>

329
00:21:22.407 --> 00:21:24.952
give off the same vibe.

330
00:21:26.703 --> 00:21:28.455
<i>At this year's sports festival.</i>

331
00:21:28.622 --> 00:21:30.582
<i>both have shown top class performances!</i>

332
00:21:30.749 --> 00:21:33.460
<i>It's like two great rivals</i>
<i>fighting against each other!</i>

333
00:21:34.169 --> 00:21:35.045
<i>Now…</i>

334
00:21:35.546 --> 00:21:37.840
<i>Midoriya versus Todoroki!</i>

335
00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:43.053
<i>Start!</i>

336
00:23:13.727 --> 00:23:15.062
<i>Here's the preview.</i>

337
00:23:15.229 --> 00:23:18.273
<i>The battle between Todoroki</i>
<i>and me is finally starting.</i>

338
00:23:18.774 --> 00:23:20.317
<i>I'll end this quickly.</i>

339
00:23:20.484 --> 00:23:23.779
<i>It's true that just Todoroki's ice</i>
<i>from his right side is strong…</i>

340
00:23:23.946 --> 00:23:25.113
<i>I told you.</i>

341
00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:29.910
<i>I will win without using that man's Quirk</i>
<i>and reject him completely.</i>

342
00:23:30.077 --> 00:23:33.038
-I <i>am your opponent!</i>
<i>-What?</i>

343
00:23:33.205 --> 00:23:35.499
<i>Next time. "Shoto Todoroki: Origin."</i>

344
00:23:36.083 --> 00:23:39.044
<i>He remembers words</i>
<i>that he had forgotten once before.</i>

345
00:23:39.211 --> 00:23:40.462
<i>Go beyond!</i>

346
00:23:40.838 --> 00:23:42.422
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
