00:00:04.046 --> 00:00:05.714
From the news chopper to the studio…

2
00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:09.176
I'm reporting live
from the skies of Hosu City!

3
00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:12.054
I'm reporting on a different story.
but look at this!

4
00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:16.391
There is fire and smoke rising
from different locations on the streets.

5
00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:20.938
Are these from accidents.
or from rioting villains?

6
00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:23.815
We are not getting any information
about any of this.

7
00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:27.528
I will report as soon
as I know the situation!

8
00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:29.488
Okay. cut!

9
00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:32.908
Keep shooting.

10
00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:37.120
I wonder what that is?

11
00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:39.873
-Where?
-Over there.

12
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.167
By the water tank
on top of the highest building.

13
00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:43.377
Can you get it?

14
00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:49.216
There are people! Two of them!

15
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.717
Curious onlookers?

16
00:00:51.093 --> 00:00:52.386
In a place like that?

17
00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:08.443
Let's go back.

18
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.281
Were you satisfied
with the results. Tomura Shigaraki?

19
00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:16.243
Idiot. That depends on tomorrow.

20
00:01:38.724 --> 00:01:41.476
<i>I am Izuku Midoriya. born Quirkless</i>

21
00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:44.062
<i>and a student at U.A. High.</i>

22
00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.608
<i>With the help of my friends. I will become</i>
<i>the greatest hero of all time!</i>

23
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.359
<i>In </i>My Hero Academia<i>!</i>

24
00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:53.882
THE AFTERMATH OF HERO KILLER: STAIN

25
00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.510
HOSU GENERAL HOSPITAL

26
00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:58.387
Were you able to sleep. Midoriya?

27
00:02:59.054 --> 00:03:00.430
No. not really.

28
00:03:00.764 --> 00:03:01.682
I didn't think so.

29
00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:03.141
Me neither.

30
00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:07.813
Thinking about it now.
we did something amazing. huh?

31
00:03:08.105 --> 00:03:09.273
Yeah.

32
00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:14.653
Seeing an ending like that really makes
you feel like it's a miracle we're alive.

33
00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:20.701
With my leg like this. he probably
could've killed us if he'd wanted to.

34
00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:24.913
Yeah. We were obviously
left alive on purpose.

35
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.999
You're amazing
to have been able to face him

36
00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:29.585
after all the murderous intent
directed at you.

37
00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:30.961
No. that's not it.

38
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:33.797
I…

39
00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:37.217
Oh. are you wounded kids awake?

40
00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:38.510
Gran Torino!

41
00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:40.429
Manual…

42
00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:43.682
Kid. I've got a lot of complaints for you.

43
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:45.434
Oh! Sorr--

44
00:03:45.601 --> 00:03:48.645
But before that. you've got a visitor.

45
00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:56.778
Hosu's chief of police. Kenji Tsuragamae.

46
00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.531
<i>Tsuragamae! Chief?</i>

47
00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:04.620
Oh. you can just stay seated. woof.

48
00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:05.871
<i>"Woof"!</i>

49
00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:10.125
You must be the U.A. students
who brought down the hero killer. right?

50
00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:11.168
Yes.

51
00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:14.338
<i>The chief of police came all this way…</i>
<i>Why?</i>

52
00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:17.048
Regarding the hero killer we arrested…

53
00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:20.427
He had fairly serious injuries.
with burns and broken bones.

54
00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:23.263
and is receiving treatment
under strict guard. woof.

55
00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:26.975
Since you are U.A. students.
I'm sure you already know

56
00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:30.229
that when superpowers
were still becoming the norm.

57
00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.564
the police attached high importance
to leadership and standards

58
00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:35.108
and made sure Quirks
were not used as weapons.

59
00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:40.531
And then. the profession of "hero"
emerged to fill that gap. woof.

60
00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:43.158
<i>For an individual's use of force</i>

61
00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:45.869
<i>and power that can easily kill others…</i>

62
00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:50.374
<i>actions that normally would be appropriate</i>
<i>to denounce. to be accepted officially</i>

63
00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:55.170
<i>is thanks to early heroes who followed the</i>
<i>ethics and rules of the profession. woof.</i>

64
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.090
Even up against the hero killer.

65
00:04:58.257 --> 00:05:01.134
for uncertified individuals
to cause injury with their Quirks

66
00:05:01.844 --> 00:05:04.471
without specific instruction
from their guardians

67
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.099
or supervisors is a clear
violation of the rules.

68
00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:09.351
The three of you.

69
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.353
and the pro heroes Endeavor.

70
00:05:11.687 --> 00:05:14.857
Manual. and Gran Torino

71
00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:17.693
must receive strict punishment.

72
00:05:18.861 --> 00:05:20.279
Wait a minute.

73
00:05:20.863 --> 00:05:23.407
If Iida hadn't done anything.
Native would've been killed.

74
00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.493
If Midoriya hadn't come.
the two of them would've been killed.

75
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.414
No one realized
that the Hero Killer had appeared.

76
00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:33.208
Are you saying we should've followed
the rules and watched people get killed?

77
00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:34.251
Wait!

78
00:05:34.418 --> 00:05:35.419
Are you saying

79
00:05:35.586 --> 00:05:37.421
that as long as it turns out all right.
it's okay to bend the rules?

80
00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:42.843
Isn't it a hero's job to save people?

81
00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:46.430
That is why you are not
a full-fledged hero yet.

82
00:05:46.722 --> 00:05:49.933
Goodness. what are you being
taught by U.A.

83
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.602
and Endeavor. woof?

84
00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:52.853
You dog!

85
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.646
Stop it. He is absolutely right.

86
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:56.064
Hang on a minute.

87
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.400
Hear him out until the end.

88
00:05:58.734 --> 00:06:02.321
That was the official opinion
of the police.

89
00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:07.326
And the punishment and such would only
happen if this were all made public. woof.

90
00:06:08.202 --> 00:06:11.914
If this were made public. you would
probably be applauded by the public.

91
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.624
but you would not be able
to escape punishment.

92
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.294
On the other hand. this is a bit
underhanded. but if it is not made public.

93
00:06:17.461 --> 00:06:20.797
the burn scars would support Endeavor
being the hero who saved the day.

94
00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:22.633
and it would end there. woof.

95
00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:26.220
Thankfully. there were very few witnesses.

96
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.264
This violation
could be crushed here. woof.

97
00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:34.436
But this would also mean no one would know
about your good judgment or achievements.

98
00:06:35.938 --> 00:06:37.064
Which do you prefer?

99
00:06:38.482 --> 00:06:43.529
Personally. I don't want to be the one
to find fault with promising young ones

100
00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:45.614
because of one big mistake. woof.

101
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.115
Either way.

102
00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:50.536
we will need to take responsibility for
being negligent in our supervisory duties.

103
00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:57.167
I am truly sorry.

104
00:06:57.543 --> 00:07:00.212
All right.
You'll cause trouble for others!

105
00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:01.880
If you understand. then don't do it again!

106
00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:03.215
I won't!

107
00:07:04.383 --> 00:07:06.343
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.137
Please take care of it.

109
00:07:09.638 --> 00:07:10.722
Because of the unfairness of adults.

110
00:07:11.265 --> 00:07:15.394
you will not be able to receive the praise
you would probably have gotten.

111
00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:16.728
but at least.

112
00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:20.357
as someone who also
protects the peace.

113
00:07:21.024 --> 00:07:22.150
I can say thank you.

114
00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:25.612
Please start with that next time.

115
00:07:26.864 --> 00:07:28.073
Todoroki…

116
00:07:29.408 --> 00:07:32.661
<i>The fight in the alley that</i>
<i>started in an unexpected way</i>

117
00:07:32.828 --> 00:07:34.997
<i>ended like this without anyone</i>
<i>knowing about it.</i>

118
00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:41.378
<i>But its influence would continue to</i>
<i>eat away at us without anyone the wiser…</i>

119
00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:43.338
They said they arrested the hero killer!

120
00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:44.506
Wow! Amazing!

121
00:07:44.673 --> 00:07:46.383
Seriously? Who beat him?

122
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.094
Endeavor!
As expected of the number two hero!

123
00:07:49.261 --> 00:07:51.096
I feel better.
but it's kind of unfortunate.

124
00:07:51.263 --> 00:07:52.806
Yeah. I know what you mean.

125
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:57.436
<i>The three villains arrested</i>
<i>and restrained during Hosu City's riots</i>

126
00:07:57.603 --> 00:07:59.980
<i>are all men with unknown</i>
<i>addresses and identities.</i>

127
00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:02.441
<i>Based on their distinctive appearance</i>

128
00:08:02.608 --> 00:08:05.694
<i>and the presence of two people</i>
<i>NHA TV filmed by chance.</i>

129
00:08:05.861 --> 00:08:07.696

<i>Why did he keep committing crimes?</i>

00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:52.449
<i>I'm reporting live from</i>
<i>Ekou Street in Hosu City.</i>

143
00:08:52.616 --> 00:08:54.535
<i>Last night. just after eight p.m..</i>

144
00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:57.955
<i>Hero Killer: Stain</i>
<i>was arrested by Endeavor on this street.</i>

145
00:08:59.915 --> 00:09:01.583
It's all anyone's talking about.

146
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:05.128
Are the Nomus just secondary?

147
00:09:10.634 --> 00:09:14.763
Once the night is over.
the world will have forgotten about you.

148
00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:20.686
Not only have they not forgotten.
but we ended up being the side story.

149
00:09:23.689 --> 00:09:25.524
GENIUS OFFICE

150
00:09:25.941 --> 00:09:29.278
Regarding the incident last night
in Hosu City in west Tokyo

151
00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:31.905
with the arrest of Hero Killer: Stain

152
00:09:32.531 --> 00:09:35.450
and the villains that resembled
the Nomu who attacked U.A….

153
00:09:35.951 --> 00:09:37.786
You are probably all
worried about that right now.

154
00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:41.039
Yes. it is something
I am also very worried about.

155
00:09:41.832 --> 00:09:44.042
People tend to only pay
attention to big events.

156
00:09:44.376 --> 00:09:48.297
However. it is especially at times
like this that heroes must remain calm.

157
00:09:48.964 --> 00:09:51.008
Chaos can sometimes tempt people

158
00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:54.678
and draw out the cruelty that
lies sleeping inside them at their core.

159
00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:58.182
Which means. it will be business
as usual for us today. as well.

160
00:09:58.974 --> 00:10:01.435
Let us brace our minds
and bodies with our tight jeans.

161
00:10:01.602 --> 00:10:03.520
Sure. Best Jeanist!

162
00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:07.274
<i>I want to go home right now…</i>

163
00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.818
Oh. I got a reply from Midoriya!

164
00:10:10.611 --> 00:10:14.907
It was at Hosu City. so that location
information was an SOS after all. huh?

165
00:10:15.199 --> 00:10:16.783
I'm glad I reported it.

166
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:17.826
Hey!

167
00:10:17.993 --> 00:10:20.037
Fourth Kind's gonna hit you!

168
00:10:20.204 --> 00:10:21.079
Let's get going!

169
00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:23.665
Wait a sec! I'm gonna reply.

170
00:10:24.875 --> 00:10:27.085
Didn't I tell you that
you must always be punctual?

171
00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:28.921
Sorry. sir!

172
00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:30.756
All right. we're going on patrol!

173
00:10:30.923 --> 00:10:31.840
Yes. sir!

174
00:10:32.758 --> 00:10:34.593
<i>No matter how damaged your hair.</i>

175
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.055
<i>the new ingredient.</i>
<i>U008 will penetrate deep into each hair.</i>

176
00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:39.681
<i>Curl…</i>

177
00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:41.141
<i>Curl…</i>

178
00:10:41.308 --> 00:10:42.518
<i>Curl. all you want.</i>

179
00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:45.646
<i>Easy curls with just a spritz!</i>

180
00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:48.023
<i>Hair spray. UNERI.</i>

181
00:10:49.066 --> 00:10:51.193
<i>Letting women ride the waves of the times.</i>

182
00:10:52.611 --> 00:10:54.071
They sure work fast.

183
00:10:54.238 --> 00:10:57.783
This is a demo.
so it'll air on TV in about a month.

184
00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:59.535
With lots of CG!

185
00:11:00.118 --> 00:11:02.412
We're gonna be on TV. huh?

186
00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:05.415
Heroes… We are heroes…

187
00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:08.085
Now. shall we go on patrol?

188
00:11:10.337 --> 00:11:11.296
Yes. ma'am!

189
00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:16.301
I see. well. I'm just glad
you and Iida are both okay.

190
00:11:16.802 --> 00:11:20.138
When I got just the address.
I got really nervous.

191
00:11:20.472 --> 00:11:23.851
<i>Sorry. Uraraka. There was a lot</i>
<i>going on. so I couldn't contact you.</i>

192
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.395
I know you went through a lot.

193
00:11:26.562 --> 00:11:29.565
Get some rest!
And tell me more about it later.

194
00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:32.109
<i>-Okay.</i>
-Uravity. we're starting basic training.

195
00:11:32.276 --> 00:11:33.360
Oh. right. sir!

196
00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:35.070
Well. I'll see you at school.

197
00:11:35.237 --> 00:11:37.155
Sorry to bother you while you're busy!
Bye!

198
00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:39.324
Your boyfriend?

199
00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:41.410
No! That's not it!

200
00:11:41.577 --> 00:11:43.120
URARAKA

201
00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:46.498
<i>Talking on the phone with a girl is…</i>
<i>amazing!</i>

202
00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:49.501
<i>Man. her voice was so close!</i>

203
00:11:54.006 --> 00:11:57.176
Oh. Iida. just now. Uraraka said…

204
00:11:57.342 --> 00:11:58.302
Midoriya.

205
00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:03.098
Iida just finished getting examined.

206
00:12:07.019 --> 00:12:10.189
My left hand might have long-term damage.

207
00:12:12.608 --> 00:12:15.110
<i>Long-term… damage?</i>

208
00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:21.241
<i>Long-term… damage?</i>

209
00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:23.577
Both of my arms were pretty beat up.

210
00:12:23.994 --> 00:12:26.496
but it looks like the damage
to my left arm was especially severe.

211
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:30.083
There was damage to my brachial plexus.

212
00:12:31.043 --> 00:12:33.795
But it just means that I'll have trouble
moving my hand and fingers

213
00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:35.839
and experience some numbness.

214
00:12:36.298 --> 00:12:37.174
Apparently.

215
00:12:37.341 --> 00:12:39.468
there's a possibility that it can be
healed with nerve transplant surgery.

216
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.847
When I found the Hero Killer.

217
00:12:44.515 --> 00:12:46.058
<i>I stopped being able to think.</i>

218
00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:49.061
<i>The first thing I should've done</i>
<i>was tell Manual.</i>

219
00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:52.272
<i>But I forgot myself in my anger.</i>

220
00:12:53.315 --> 00:12:56.735
<i>Being taken in by the hatred before you</i>
<i>and trying to fulfill your own desires…</i>

221
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.863
<i>That is the furthest</i>
<i>from what a hero should be.</i>

222
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:05.077
I hate him. but he spoke the truth.

223
00:13:05.661 --> 00:13:06.620
That's why.

224
00:13:07.246 --> 00:13:09.581
until I become a true hero.

225
00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:11.917
I think I want to leave
my left hand as it is.

226
00:13:13.043 --> 00:13:14.253
Iida…

227
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:17.589
<i>Back then.</i>

228
00:13:18.382 --> 00:13:19.675
<i>if I had been more emphatic…</i>

229
00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:22.636
<i>No. stop.</i>

230
00:13:23.762 --> 00:13:25.639
<i>Iida's already accepted it.</i>

231
00:13:25.931 --> 00:13:27.933
<i>It would be rude of me to apologize.</i>

232
00:13:29.977 --> 00:13:32.312
Iida. I feel the same way.

233
00:13:35.524 --> 00:13:37.192
<i>I will let this hand guide me.</i>

234
00:13:39.528 --> 00:13:42.197
Let's become stronger… together.

235
00:13:52.249 --> 00:13:53.876
I feel… kind of bad…

236
00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:56.003
About what?

237
00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:01.717
I feel like if I get involved…
other people mess up their hands…

238
00:14:04.136 --> 00:14:05.137
Is it a curse?

239
00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:08.932
HOSU GENERAL HOSPITAL

240
00:14:09.099 --> 00:14:11.518
Todoroki.
I didn't know you could make jokes!

241
00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:13.020
No. I'm not joking.

242
00:14:13.187 --> 00:14:15.397
I'm like "The Hand Crusher" or something.

243
00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:19.318
"The Hand Crusher"!

244
00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:25.616
<i>A phone call is here!</i>

245
00:14:25.782 --> 00:14:26.658
<i>A phone--</i>

246
00:14:27.117 --> 00:14:28.285
Yes. hello?

247
00:14:28.452 --> 00:14:30.829
<i>That ringtone is annoying as usual.</i>

248
00:14:31.747 --> 00:14:33.081
Sir!

249
00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:35.751
<i>Izuku Midoriya! Goodness!</i>

250
00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:37.461
Thanks to him. I'm getting a pay cut.

251
00:14:37.628 --> 00:14:40.005
and my teaching license
is being revoked for six months.

252
00:14:40.172 --> 00:14:43.759
Well. considering the extenuating
circumstances. it couldn't be helped.

253
00:14:44.343 --> 00:14:47.346
The part where he just starts moving
without thinking is just like you.

254
00:14:47.513 --> 00:14:48.388
Toshinori!

255
00:14:48.764 --> 00:14:50.432
I humbly apologize!

256
00:14:50.599 --> 00:14:53.185
It is because of my insufficient teaching…

257
00:14:53.519 --> 00:14:55.854
To cause you such trouble…

258
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:57.564
Oh dear…

259
00:14:57.731 --> 00:15:00.275
<i>I don't care about my teaching license</i>
<i>anymore anyway.</i>

260
00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:06.490
I only got it to teach you so I could keep
my promise to your predecessor. Shimura.

261
00:15:06.657 --> 00:15:09.409
And I truly appreciate what you did.

262
00:15:09.576 --> 00:15:13.121
I am who I am today
because of your teaching.

263
00:15:13.288 --> 00:15:15.624
<i>You say that. but you never come to visit.</i>

264
00:15:15.791 --> 00:15:19.878
It's just that…
My new life as a teacher is so busy…

265
00:15:20.337 --> 00:15:24.508
I called today
to talk about the hero killer.

266
00:15:24.842 --> 00:15:28.095
I only saw him in person
for a few minutes.

267
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:30.514
but even so. he had me shaking.

268
00:15:30.931 --> 00:15:34.393
To be able to frighten
someone like you. Gran Torino…

269
00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.979
But he had already been tied up.
so what was it?

270
00:15:37.855 --> 00:15:40.983
The pressure I felt from him
was probably his strong ideology…

271
00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:44.862
<i>or the intimidation from his obsession.</i>

272
00:15:45.028 --> 00:15:46.947
<i>I'm not saying this to praise him.</i>

273
00:15:47.114 --> 00:15:52.119
<i>but it's the same quality as that</i>
<i>"Symbol of Peace" thing you have.</i>

274
00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:54.121
The same quality…

275
00:15:54.288 --> 00:15:57.124
<i>To put it simply. it's charisma.</i>

276
00:15:57.833 --> 00:15:59.042
<i>As the investigation continues.</i>

277
00:15:59.209 --> 00:16:00.794
<i>his ideology</i>
<i>and opinion will be all over the media.</i>

278
00:16:00.961 --> 00:16:03.839
<i>online news. TV. magazines…</i>

279
00:16:04.214 --> 00:16:10.220
<i>The current age. for better or worse.</i>
<i>is one of suppression.</i>

280
00:16:10.387 --> 00:16:13.056
<i>People influenced by his ideas</i>
<i>will definitely appear.</i>

281
00:16:13.891 --> 00:16:16.810
<i>It's true that there will be</i>
<i>those influenced by him.</i>

282
00:16:16.977 --> 00:16:19.146
<i>but they will probably appear</i>
<i>sporadically.</i>

283
00:16:19.313 --> 00:16:22.316
<i>When they appear one by one. heroes will</i>
<i>take care of them like they did this time.</i>

284
00:16:22.858 --> 00:16:24.818
That's where the League of Villains
comes in.

285
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:29.573
<i>The Hosu incident suggests that Stain</i>
<i>and the League are connected somehow.</i>

286
00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:32.159
<i>With this.</i>

287
00:16:32.326 --> 00:16:34.703
<i>the League will go from being thought</i>
<i>of as a bunch of juvenile delinquents</i>

288
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:36.288
<i>that attacked U.A.</i>

289
00:16:36.455 --> 00:16:38.165
<i>to being recognized as the group</i>

290
00:16:38.332 --> 00:16:39.750
<i>with that ideology.</i>

291
00:16:40.501 --> 00:16:43.712
<i>In other words. there's a receptacle</i>
<i>ready to receive them.</i>

292
00:16:45.005 --> 00:16:47.132
<i>Even if the malice</i>
<i>of each individual is small.</i>

293
00:16:47.299 --> 00:16:49.051
<i>if all that evil gathers under one will.</i>

294
00:16:49.218 --> 00:16:52.513
<i>it will swell up</i>
<i>to hundreds of times that.</i>

295
00:16:53.347 --> 00:16:56.725
If the enemy general knew
this would happen from the beginning

296
00:16:56.892 --> 00:16:59.353
then he's pretty good.

297
00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.688
<i>He's steadily getting rid of obstacles.</i>

298
00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:05.983
<i>trying to create conditions</i>
<i>to further his own purpose.</i>

299
00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:10.821
When I heard from Tsukauchi
that Nomu had multiple Quirks.

300
00:17:10.989 --> 00:17:13.367
I had a bad feeling.

301
00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:16.994
<i>The man who killed my sworn friend</i>
<i>and your master.</i>

302
00:17:17.162 --> 00:17:23.502
<i>the previous One For All holder. Shimura.</i>
<i>and opened that hole in your stomach…</i>

303
00:17:24.502 --> 00:17:28.549
<i>All For One</i>
<i>must be starting to move again.</i>

304
00:17:30.676 --> 00:17:33.804
For him to have survived after that injury

305
00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:36.807
is a reality I don't want to believe.

306
00:17:39.518 --> 00:17:44.022
Toshinori. that child
admires you so bravely.

307
00:17:44.815 --> 00:17:47.943
<i>You should find time to tell him properly</i>

308
00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:52.322
<i>about everything concerning</i>
<i>you and One For All.</i>

309
00:17:58.078 --> 00:17:59.955
<i>Two days after the Hosu incident.</i>

310
00:18:00.539 --> 00:18:04.877
<i>the hero killer's identity started</i>
<i>being exposed from various angles.</i>

311
00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:10.048
Recently. there've been
less people willing to break the law.

312
00:18:10.674 --> 00:18:13.844
My buddies are all complaining
about not being able to sell anything.

313
00:18:14.011 --> 00:18:15.387
It's a pain.

314
00:18:16.263 --> 00:18:19.266
'Cause it's a serious crime to develop
or sell support items

315
00:18:19.433 --> 00:18:22.477
and costumes without a license…

316
00:18:22.978 --> 00:18:28.150
On top of that. there have been rumors
recently that legit support companies

317
00:18:28.317 --> 00:18:31.278
have been selling on the black market
to people without hero licenses.

318
00:18:33.113 --> 00:18:35.324
I miss the days back before All Might.

319
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.534
I was still young back then. too.

320
00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:41.371
The villains were wild and impulsive.
and that turned into enthusiasm

321
00:18:41.538 --> 00:18:42.915
the whole country was teeming with.

322
00:18:43.457 --> 00:18:45.042
It was a good time.

323
00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:50.422
But when All Might appeared.
everything changed.

324
00:18:51.507 --> 00:18:54.426
It's all thanks to that Symbol of Justice.

325
00:18:55.219 --> 00:18:57.888
Maybe it's time for me to retire.

326
00:18:58.347 --> 00:18:59.431
About that.

327
00:18:59.598 --> 00:19:00.474
Listen to this.

328
00:19:00.933 --> 00:19:05.270
Just between you and me.
I know of a way to make some cash.

329
00:19:05.604 --> 00:19:11.026
I'm only telling you because
I know you guys have quality goods.

330
00:19:12.903 --> 00:19:14.363
Have you seen this video?

331
00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:16.657
Huh? Who's this?

332
00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:20.994
It's a video of the Hero Killer.
He's hot right now.

333
00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:31.630
<i>Hero Killer: Stain.</i>
<i>Real name: Chizome Akaguro.</i>

334
00:19:31.964 --> 00:19:33.006
<i>All Might's debut</i>

335
00:19:33.173 --> 00:19:35.467
<i>left a deep impression on him.</i>
<i>and he set his sights on becoming a hero.</i>

336
00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:38.053
<i>He enrolled in a private hero high school</i>

337
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.513
<i>but was disappointed in the fundamentally</i>

338
00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.057
<i>depraved view of heroes taught</i>
<i>by the educational system.</i>

339
00:19:42.224 --> 00:19:44.059
<i>He dropped out in the summer</i>
<i>of his first year.</i>

340
00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:45.769
<i>Until the end of his teenage years.</i>

341
00:19:45.936 --> 00:19:47.437
<i>he called for</i>
<i>a return to the old idea of heroes</i>

342
00:19:47.604 --> 00:19:49.231
<i>making speeches on the street</i>

343
00:19:49.481 --> 00:19:51.733
<i>until he realized</i>
<i>resignedly that words had no power.</i>

344
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.570
<i>For the next ten years.</i>
<i>in order to fulfill his "duty."</i>

345
00:19:54.736 --> 00:19:57.406
<i>he studied and trained</i>
<i>in killing techniques on his own.</i>

346
00:19:57.573 --> 00:19:59.741
<i>During this time. his parents passed away.</i>

347
00:19:59.908 --> 00:20:03.328
<i>and that affair</i>
<i>was considered non-criminal.</i>

348
00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:06.582
<i>He emphasized a return</i>
<i>to the old idea of heroes.</i>

349
00:20:06.915 --> 00:20:09.418
<i>Heroes should not seek compensation.</i>

350
00:20:09.877 --> 00:20:13.213
<i>The title of "hero" must only be granted</i>
<i>to those who epitomize self-sacrifice.</i>

351
00:20:14.006 --> 00:20:17.217
<i>The present-day heroes</i>
<i>are fakes who are all talk.</i>

352
00:20:17.676 --> 00:20:22.306
<i>He wanted society to realize this</i>
<i>through his purges one after another.</i>

353
00:20:22.973 --> 00:20:26.810
<i>Someone must be dyed in blood…</i>

354
00:20:28.103 --> 00:20:31.940
I must take back
what it means to be a hero!

355
00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:37.196
<i>Come! Try and get me. you fakes!</i>

356
00:20:39.114 --> 00:20:42.576
The only one I'll let kill me

357
00:20:42.743 --> 00:20:44.244
<i>is the true hero…</i>

358
00:20:45.412 --> 00:20:48.665
All Might!

359
00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:55.005
This keeps getting uploaded and taken
down online. like a game of cat and mouse.

360
00:20:55.172 --> 00:20:56.965
Both sides have realized…

361
00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:59.927
Especially the last part…

362
00:21:00.093 --> 00:21:03.013
This guy's way of life is infectious.

363
00:21:03.931 --> 00:21:08.560
From scoundrels with countless
previous convictions to felons on the run.

364
00:21:08.727 --> 00:21:10.562
all the major players…

365
00:21:11.563 --> 00:21:14.525
Including me. of course.

366
00:21:15.651 --> 00:21:18.487
<i>Not that many people have noticed yet.</i>

367
00:21:19.154 --> 00:21:23.200
<i>but the evil that was scattered.</i>
<i>hiding deep and quiet in places</i>

368
00:21:23.367 --> 00:21:25.494
<i>where no one could see them.</i>

369
00:21:26.578 --> 00:21:28.288
<i>has now been hit by a single fever.</i>

370
00:21:28.956 --> 00:21:32.543
<i>To go to the organization</i>
<i>Hero Killer: Stain is part of…</i>

371
00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:36.922
<i>They have started heading</i>
<i>to the League of Villains.</i>

372
00:23:13.185 --> 00:23:14.186
<i>Here's the preview!</i>

373
00:23:14.353 --> 00:23:18.440
<i>I wonder how everyone's internships</i>
<i>went while I was in the hospital…</i>

374
00:23:18.607 --> 00:23:20.108
<i>You curious. Midoriya?</i>

375
00:23:20.275 --> 00:23:22.110
<i>Asu… I mean. Tsu!</i>

376
00:23:22.277 --> 00:23:24.530
<i>Then we'll respond to your request</i>

377
00:23:24.696 --> 00:23:27.032
<i>by showing Class A at their internships.</i>

378
00:23:27.199 --> 00:23:28.283
<i>I'm looking forward to that.</i>

379
00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:31.328
<i>But then. your part in the episode</i>
<i>will be smaller.</i>

380
00:23:31.495 --> 00:23:32.454
<i>Ribbit. ribbit.</i>

381
00:23:32.621 --> 00:23:35.040
<i>Next time. "Everyone's Internships."</i>

382
00:23:35.207 --> 00:23:37.918
<i>You can enjoy watching me</i>
<i>in this anime-original episode!</i>

383
00:23:38.085 --> 00:23:39.419
<i>Go beyond!</i>

384
00:23:39.586 --> 00:23:41.588
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
