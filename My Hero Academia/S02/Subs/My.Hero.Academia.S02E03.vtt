00:00:02.127 --> 00:00:04.254
<i>The world has become a superhuman society.</i>

2
00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:08.175
<i>and about 80% of the world's population</i>
<i>now has some kind of special trait.</i>

3
00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:10.093
<i>In this world swirling with chaos.</i>

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.180
<i>the profession that everyone</i>
<i>once dreamed about and admired</i>

5
00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:15.140
<i>came into the limelight.</i>

6
00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.478
<i>Heroes of justice fighting villains</i>
<i>and saving people from distress.</i>

7
00:00:20.938 --> 00:00:26.902
<i>Yes. this is the story of how</i>
<i>I became the greatest hero.</i>

8
00:01:59.077 --> 00:02:00.037
Midoriya.

9
00:02:02.706 --> 00:02:03.790
I'm going to beat you.

10
00:02:09.253 --> 00:02:11.006
The students from the other courses

11
00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:13.091
are aiming for the top
with everything they've got!

12
00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.762
I can't afford to fall behind.

13
00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:21.350
I'll be going for it
with everything I have. too.

14
00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:32.486
IN THEIR OWN QUIRKY WAYS

15
00:02:33.362 --> 00:02:36.365
<i>The U.A. sports festival</i>
<i>first-year stage qualifier!</i>

16
00:02:36.782 --> 00:02:40.827
The first game is an obstacle course race!

17
00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:45.958
It's a cruel chicken race where anything
goes as long as you stay on course!

18
00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:47.042
Hey.

19
00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.669
We'll bring you the exciting scenes

20
00:02:48.836 --> 00:02:52.673
<i>-with camera robots set around the course!</i>
<i>-You don't need me. do you?</i>

21
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.675
<i>Now then…</i>

22
00:02:54.842 --> 00:02:57.678
<i>Can the golden eggs</i>

23
00:02:57.845 --> 00:03:02.683
<i>aiming to be future heroes</i>
<i>get through the mass of Robo Infernos?</i>

24
00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:05.561
If they went through all this trouble.

25
00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:08.355
I wish they would've prepared
something better.

26
00:03:11.942 --> 00:03:14.152
Since my stupid old man is watching.

27
00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:30.294
He stopped them!

28
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.296
Between their legs! We can get through!

29
00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:33.672
I wouldn't if I were you.

30
00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:36.466
I froze them when they were unbalanced.

31
00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:39.636
They'll fall over.

32
00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:52.733
<i>The first one through the first barrier</i>
<i>is Shoto Todoroki from Class 1-A!</i>

33
00:03:55.027 --> 00:03:57.196
Hey! Someone's trapped underneath!

34
00:03:57.613 --> 00:03:58.989
Wouldn't that kill them?

35
00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:01.158
Will people <i>die</i> at this sports festival?

36
00:04:05.204 --> 00:04:07.080
Like I'd die!

37
00:04:07.873 --> 00:04:11.335
<i>Kirishima from Class 1-A</i>
<i>was underneath! That's crazy!</i>

38
00:04:11.502 --> 00:04:12.878
That bastard. Todoroki!

39
00:04:13.045 --> 00:04:15.214
He timed it on purpose
so it'd be right when they fell.

40
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.089
If it hadn't been me.
someone would've died!

41
00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:20.427
<i>Eijiro Kirishima!</i>
<i>Quirk: Hardening!</i>

42
00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:23.180
<i>His body can get super hard!</i>

43
00:04:23.347 --> 00:04:26.183
<i>He can become the strongest spear.</i>
<i>or the strongest shield!</i>

44
00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:29.603
That Class A…

45
00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:33.565
really is filled with bastards!

46
00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:36.151
<i>Tetsutetsu from Class B</i>
<i>was also underneath!</i>

47
00:04:36.318 --> 00:04:37.611
<i>That's crazy!</i>

48
00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:39.571
If it hadn't been me.
someone would've died!

49
00:04:40.531 --> 00:04:43.200
<i>Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu.</i>
<i>Quirk: Steel!</i>

50
00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:45.536
<i>His body can become like steel!</i>

51
00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:48.413
<i>He can become the strongest spear.</i>
<i>or the strongest shield!</i>

52
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.457
Our Quirks are pretty much the same?

53
00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:52.000
I have a hard enough time
standing out as it is!

54
00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:53.752
Wait. you little…

55
00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.754
Those guys are lucky.

56
00:04:55.921 --> 00:04:57.965
They can get through without
being afraid of getting crushed.

57
00:04:58.632 --> 00:05:01.677
Anyway. let's work together
for now to clear a path!

58
00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:05.931
Bakugo?

59
00:05:06.098 --> 00:05:08.559
<i>Like I'd let you get ahead of me!</i>

60
00:05:10.686 --> 00:05:12.354
<i>Class 1-A's Bakugo!</i>

61
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:14.189
<i>Since the bottom's blocked.</i>
<i>he goes overhead!</i>

62
00:05:14.565 --> 00:05:15.691
Clever!

63
00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:20.529
You seem like you'd be
the type to plow straight through.

64
00:05:20.696 --> 00:05:22.406
but you can go around when you need to.
huh?

65
00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:25.367
I'm going to hitch a ride!

66
00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:29.705
<i>Hanta Sero.</i>
<i>Quirk: Tape!</i>

67
00:05:29.872 --> 00:05:32.040
<i>He can shoot tape-like</i>
<i>material from his elbows!</i>

68
00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:33.750
<i>He can also wind it up and use it to move!</i>

69
00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:35.878
<i>Or cut it off and use it as a trap!</i>

70
00:05:36.587 --> 00:05:38.422
-Land!
-Aye. aye!

71
00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:42.301
<i>Fumikage Tokoyami.</i>
<i>Quirk: Dark Shadow!</i>

72
00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:46.180
<i>He's got a shadow-like monster</i>
<i>living inside him</i>

73
00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:47.848
<i>that can materialize</i>
<i>and change shape elastically!</i>

74
00:05:53.145 --> 00:05:56.982
As expected. most of the group
that's gone ahead is from Class A.

75
00:05:58.567 --> 00:06:01.612
Class B and the other courses
aren't bad. either!

76
00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:02.905
It's just…

77
00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:05.532
…Class A doesn't spend
a lot of time standing around.

78
00:06:19.755 --> 00:06:21.840
Those who experienced firsthand

79
00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:24.635
<i>that world above them through</i>
<i>the incident at USJ…</i>

80
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:25.802
Release!

81
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.430
<i>Those who had fear</i>
<i>planted in their hearts…</i>

82
00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:31.767
<i>Those who dealt with it</i>
<i>and pulled through…</i>

83
00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:36.688
They all used that experience
to drown out their hesitation.

84
00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:40.567
<i>I can't rely on One For All</i>
<i>this early in the competition!</i>

85
00:06:44.947 --> 00:06:47.032
It's the armor
of the one Todoroki defeated!

86
00:06:49.201 --> 00:06:52.162
<i>That robot will lock onto</i>
<i>the target and track it.</i>

87
00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:54.498
<i>I'll make it build up momentum…</i>

88
00:06:54.665 --> 00:06:56.375
<i>And then…</i>

89
00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:57.918
<i>It won't be able to stop suddenly!</i>

90
00:07:00.003 --> 00:07:01.839
<i>Move!</i>

91
00:07:03.257 --> 00:07:06.677
<i>This can be a shield. too!</i>
<i>It'll be useful!</i>

92
00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:16.895
Yaoyorozu!

93
00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:18.438
A piece of cake.

94
00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:25.195
The path is clear!

95
00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:28.866
She defeated
those zero-point villains so easily?

96
00:07:29.408 --> 00:07:31.535
No wonder
she got in through recommendations.

97
00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:35.706
During the entrance exam.
they were there to be avoided.

98
00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:40.586
If you see them as things to be defeated.
they're dumb hunks of metal.

99
00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:42.713
You'll start to see openings.

100
00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:47.176
I want you to tell the world "I am here!"

101
00:07:49.178 --> 00:07:51.346
<i>I told him that even though</i>
<i>I knew it'd be unreasonable.</i>

102
00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:53.515
<i>It doesn't matter if it's close!</i>

103
00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:55.350
<i>Just get to the next round!</i>

104
00:07:56.435 --> 00:07:59.062
<i>Hey. hey!</i>
<i>The first barrier's a piece of cake?</i>

105
00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:02.191
Then what about the second?

106
00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:05.402
<i>If you fall. you're out!</i>

107
00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:07.863
<i>If you don't wanna fall. then crawl!</i>

108
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:09.907
<i>It's "The Fall"!</i>

109
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.076
When did they build this stage?

110
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.536
Tsu?

111
00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:16.038
Ribbit!

112
00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:17.539
Ribbit.

113
00:08:18.207 --> 00:08:20.083
This is like a glorified tight rope.

114
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:21.585
She's fast!

115
00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:24.755
Glitter.

116
00:08:24.922 --> 00:08:27.466
Here it is!
Here's my chance to show off!

117
00:08:28.217 --> 00:08:31.637
It's time for my support items
to be in the limelight!

118
00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:35.224
Look. all you support companies
across the country!

119
00:08:35.933 --> 00:08:37.433
Wire arrows and…

120
00:08:37.601 --> 00:08:39.727
hover soles! Glitter!

121
00:08:39.895 --> 00:08:40.938
You're from the support course?

122
00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:43.732
What? It's okay to bring in items?

123
00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:47.611
The hero course undergoes
combat training regularly. right?

124
00:08:47.778 --> 00:08:49.738
In order to keep things fair.

125
00:08:49.905 --> 00:08:52.074
we are allow to equip items and costumes.

126
00:08:52.241 --> 00:08:54.785
as long as we developed them ourselves!

127
00:08:54.952 --> 00:08:57.246
Or perhaps I should say…

128
00:08:58.247 --> 00:09:00.374
for those of us in the support course.

129
00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:03.544
this is the place

130
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.673
where we can show off our ideas
and skills to companies!

131
00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:12.970
Come. take a look. all you companies!
Especially the big ones!

132
00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:18.225
Look at my super cute babies!

133
00:09:26.984 --> 00:09:27.985
Wow.

134
00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:29.862
That's so annoying…

135
00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:31.321
I can't lose!

136
00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:32.990
That's some misplaced equality!

137
00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:35.909
Nice…

138
00:09:38.954 --> 00:09:40.163
<i>A lot of different people</i>

139
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.501
are working hard
for their chance. huh. Eraser Head?

140
00:09:44.668 --> 00:09:47.129
What are you idiots stopping for?

141
00:09:49.715 --> 00:09:52.968
<i>And now. the leader of the pack</i>
<i>is easily getting through first!</i>

142
00:09:53.677 --> 00:09:56.555
<i>Looks like he's getting fired up.</i>
<i>A slow starter?</i>

143
00:09:57.306 --> 00:09:59.016
Damn it!

144
00:10:02.603 --> 00:10:04.563
My older brother
is probably also watching.

145
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:07.357
I can't let him see me act uncool!

146
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.360
<i>That's so uncool!</i>

147
00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:12.988
That guy in first place is way ahead!

148
00:10:13.155 --> 00:10:14.615
His Quirk is really strong.

149
00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:16.909
but his natural athletic ability
and judgment

150
00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:18.744
are also a cut above everyone else's.

151
00:10:18.911 --> 00:10:23.665
Of course it is.
That's the Flame Hero. Endeavor's son.

152
00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:27.586
No wonder! The blood of the guy
second only to All Might. huh?

153
00:10:27.753 --> 00:10:30.672
There'll be fighting over
who gets him as a sidekick!

154
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:35.260
<i>The lead pack is a step ahead. but below</i>
<i>them. everyone's clumped together!</i>

155
00:10:35.427 --> 00:10:38.138
<i>They haven't announced</i>
<i>how many people will make it through.</i>

156
00:10:38.305 --> 00:10:40.182
<i>so you can't relax! Push forward!</i>

157
00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:42.476
Izuku…

158
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:50.943
<i>And now. we've quickly</i>
<i>arrived at the final barrier!</i>

159
00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:52.903
<i>The reality here is…</i>

160
00:10:53.487 --> 00:10:55.322
<i>that it's a minefield!</i>

161
00:10:55.489 --> 00:10:58.575
<i>It's set up so that you can tell</i>
<i>where the mines are if you look carefully!</i>

162
00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:00.827
<i>So you have to exploit your eyes and legs!</i>

163
00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:05.082
By the way. these landmines are for games.
so they're not that powerful.

164
00:11:05.624 --> 00:11:09.711
but they're loud and flashy enough
to make you wet your pants!

165
00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:11.213
That depends on the person.

166
00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:13.924
<i>First place is already there?</i>

167
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.593
<i>Faster!</i>

168
00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:23.976
<i>I see. This is an obstacle that puts</i>
<i>those in the lead at a disadvantage.</i>

169
00:11:24.142 --> 00:11:25.811
<i>Trying to make it entertaining. huh?</i>

170
00:11:30.148 --> 00:11:31.817
This doesn't affect me!

171
00:11:33.986 --> 00:11:38.198
Bastard. don't declare
war to the wrong person!

172
00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:41.785
<i>And now.</i>
<i>we've got someone new in the lead!</i>

173
00:11:41.952 --> 00:11:46.039
<i>Rejoice. mass media! It's the kind</i>
<i>of development you guys love!</i>

174
00:11:48.417 --> 00:11:49.793
<i>Hey. hey. hey.</i>

175
00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.171
<i>the rest of the pack is</i>
<i>also speeding up!</i>

176
00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:53.422
<i>However!</i>

177
00:11:53.589 --> 00:11:56.508
<i>Even as they push and pull at each other.</i>
<i>can the two at the top remain in the lead?</i>

178
00:12:07.019 --> 00:12:08.562
It's far…

179
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.609
But there's still stuff I have to do!

180
00:12:22.284 --> 00:12:25.204
I'm gonna borrow your idea. Kacchan!

181
00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:34.421
<i>There's a huge explosion at the back!</i>

182
00:12:34.922 --> 00:12:36.840
<i>What's with that force?</i>

183
00:12:43.597 --> 00:12:44.556
What?

184
00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:47.142
<i>Was it an accident.</i>
<i>or did he do it on purpose?</i>

185
00:12:47.309 --> 00:12:52.397
<i>Class A's Midoriya is in</i>
<i>hot pursuit with that blast!</i>

186
00:12:56.777 --> 00:12:58.779
<i>Landmines used for games…</i>

187
00:12:58.946 --> 00:13:01.448
<i>The type with fuses that</i>
<i>go off if you step on them.</i>

188
00:13:01.615 --> 00:13:03.659
<i>They're not that powerful.</i>

189
00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:06.203
<i>but if I lose my balance</i>
<i>and set off a bunch of them.</i>

190
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:07.996
<i>I'll lose a lot of time.</i>

191
00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:10.374
<i>If I take injuries</i>
<i>and stamina into account.</i>

192
00:13:10.541 --> 00:13:13.168
<i>it'd be better to slow down</i>
<i>and avoid them.</i>

193
00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:16.505
<i>The jumpers can't jump carelessly either.</i>

194
00:13:16.672 --> 00:13:19.716
<i>and the further ahead you are.</i>
<i>the more landmines you'll have to avoid.</i>

195
00:13:20.175 --> 00:13:22.761
<i>They probably can't go</i>
<i>very fast with all the obstacles.</i>

196
00:13:23.554 --> 00:13:24.680
<i>Look carefully!</i>

197
00:13:24.847 --> 00:13:26.932
<i>The places where those in front avoided…</i>

198
00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:30.561
<i>Everyone was the most careful</i>
<i>around the entrance.</i>

199
00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:32.396
<i>There are a lot of landmines left.</i>

200
00:13:32.563 --> 00:13:33.564
<i>It'll be fine.</i>

201
00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.357
-What's Midoriya doing?
-<i>Don't be impatient here!</i>

202
00:13:35.524 --> 00:13:37.401
<i>In the lead are Bakugo and Todoroki!</i>

203
00:13:37.568 --> 00:13:40.237
<i>They'll get through the last barrier soon!</i>

204
00:13:40.404 --> 00:13:41.280
All right.

205
00:13:44.408 --> 00:13:45.993
I'm gonna borrow your idea. Kacchan!

206
00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:48.662
<i>Super explosive speed turbo!</i>

207
00:13:55.377 --> 00:13:56.461
That's…

208
00:13:57.171 --> 00:14:01.258
<i>Class A's Midoriya is in hot pursuit</i>
<i>with that blast!</i>

209
00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:05.804
<i>Actually. he's taken the lead!</i>

210
00:14:05.971 --> 00:14:08.056
LET'S FIGHT FOR VICTORY!!

211
00:14:08.223 --> 00:14:10.434
<i>I flew just like I'd planned.</i>

212
00:14:10.601 --> 00:14:12.269
<i>but there's so much force!</i>

213
00:14:12.436 --> 00:14:13.437
<i>And…</i>

214
00:14:13.979 --> 00:14:16.231
<i>I didn't think about landing!</i>

215
00:14:18.025 --> 00:14:19.067
Deku!

216
00:14:19.234 --> 00:14:21.778
Don't go ahead of me!

217
00:14:23.614 --> 00:14:25.741
<i>This'll give those in the back a path…</i>

218
00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:28.535
<i>but I don't have time</i>
<i>to worry about what's behind me!</i>

219
00:14:28.869 --> 00:14:31.872
The two <i>formerly</i> in the lead have
stopped trying to slow each other down

220
00:14:32.039 --> 00:14:33.790
<i>and are chasing Midoriya!</i>

221
00:14:33.957 --> 00:14:36.752
<i>Now that they have a common enemy.</i>
<i>they've stopped fighting!</i>

222
00:14:36.919 --> 00:14:39.338
<i>The fight's not over yet. though!</i>

223
00:14:39.505 --> 00:14:41.256
<i>What are you saying?</i>

224
00:14:42.508 --> 00:14:43.425
<i>Oh no…</i>

225
00:14:43.592 --> 00:14:44.676
<i>I'm losing speed!</i>

226
00:14:44.843 --> 00:14:45.928
<i>That's not surprising.</i>

227
00:14:46.094 --> 00:14:47.471
<i>They'll overtake me in an instant!</i>

228
00:14:48.055 --> 00:14:49.723
<i>Thinking about the time I'd lose landing.</i>

229
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:51.934
<i>there's no way I'd be able</i>
<i>to take back the lead.</i>

230
00:14:52.351 --> 00:14:55.062
<i>Damn it! No! Don't let go!</i>

231
00:14:55.521 --> 00:14:58.899
<i>Grab hold of that chance you got to get</i>
<i>in front of these two.</i>

232
00:14:59.066 --> 00:15:01.401
<i>and don't let go!</i>

233
00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:03.987
<i>If I can't take back the lead.</i>

234
00:15:04.947 --> 00:15:07.741
<i>then I can't let them get ahead of me!</i>

235
00:15:15.457 --> 00:15:18.794
<i>Midoriya swiftly blocks those behind him!</i>

236
00:15:19.127 --> 00:15:21.797
<i>Would you believe it?</i>
<i>He cleared the minefield in an instant!</i>

237
00:15:24.716 --> 00:15:27.177
<i>Eraser Head. your class is amazing!</i>

238
00:15:27.344 --> 00:15:29.304
What're you teaching them?

239
00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:31.431
I didn't do anything.

240
00:15:32.724 --> 00:15:35.936
<i>They got each other fired up on their own.</i>

241
00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.190
<i>-U.A. sports festival. first-year stage!</i>
<i>-Not listening!</i>

242
00:15:40.357 --> 00:15:45.821
<i>Who could've predicted the developments</i>
<i>at the beginning or this conclusion?</i>

243
00:15:46.989 --> 00:15:50.701
<i>Right now. the first person back</i>
<i>in the stadium is that man…</i>

244
00:15:52.369 --> 00:15:55.664
<i>Izuku Midoriya's made a huge splash!</i>

245
00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:03.338
Izu…

246
00:16:05.924 --> 00:16:07.968
Hey. that kid's…

247
00:16:09.011 --> 00:16:11.972
Oh yeah. If I remember correctly.
he's from last year…

248
00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:13.182
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

249
00:16:15.976 --> 00:16:17.978
This brat is…

250
00:16:49.092 --> 00:16:53.305
<i>This sports festival is a competition</i>
<i>where they have to aim for the top.</i>

251
00:16:53.472 --> 00:16:55.474
<i>even if it means defeating</i>
<i>their friends and classmates.</i>

252
00:16:56.892 --> 00:16:59.895
<i>Modern heroes depend a lot</i>
<i>on their popularity.</i>

253
00:17:00.062 --> 00:17:04.358
<i>so they need to have that desire</i>
<i>to be above all the others.</i>

254
00:17:05.776 --> 00:17:08.569
<i>At your core. you are a hero</i>
<i>who wants to help others.</i>

255
00:17:09.445 --> 00:17:11.823
<i>That is why I chose you.</i>

256
00:17:13.116 --> 00:17:17.538
<i>but I thought that was also your weakness.</i>

257
00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.792
<i>I was worrying over absolutely nothing!</i>

258
00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:23.961
<i>Sorry!</i>

259
00:17:24.127 --> 00:17:26.797
<i>You should still try to stop</i>
<i>being such a crybaby. though.</i>

260
00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:28.924
What do you think?

261
00:17:29.383 --> 00:17:32.094
First of all. Midoriya's stock
will climb fast.

262
00:17:32.553 --> 00:17:35.013
However.
he still has not shown his Quirk yet.

263
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.515
so it's hard to predict what will happen.

264
00:17:37.099 --> 00:17:42.145
If you took on management of an agency.
how would you market him? Opinions?

265
00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:43.272
What do you think?

266
00:17:43.438 --> 00:17:45.023
His appearance is out.

267
00:17:45.399 --> 00:17:47.359
If he were particular
about his abilities or aesthetics.

268
00:17:47.526 --> 00:17:49.486
we could highlight those parts.

269
00:17:49.653 --> 00:17:52.531
but without the raw material to work with…

270
00:17:52.698 --> 00:17:53.740
<i>That business course!</i>

271
00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:55.617
<i>They never change. huh?</i>

272
00:17:56.618 --> 00:17:57.619
<i>The business course!</i>

273
00:17:57.786 --> 00:18:00.664
<i>There is not really any benefit to them</i>
<i>participating in the sports festival!</i>

274
00:18:01.123 --> 00:18:01.999
<i>Therefore.</i>

275
00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:06.712
<i>they cultivate their instincts by selling</i>
<i>things or doing marketing simulations!</i>

276
00:18:06.879 --> 00:18:08.172
<i>They've got a lot of free time!</i>

277
00:18:13.677 --> 00:18:14.636
Again…

278
00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:16.054
Damn!

279
00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:18.098
Damn it!

280
00:18:19.349 --> 00:18:22.311
<i>And now.</i>
<i>they're finishing one after another!</i>

281
00:18:22.477 --> 00:18:26.648
<i>We'll make a list of the results later.</i>
<i>but for now. good work!</i>

282
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.530
Deku! You were amazing!

283
00:18:33.989 --> 00:18:35.157
Uraraka?

284
00:18:35.324 --> 00:18:36.700
First place is amazing!

285
00:18:36.867 --> 00:18:38.577
That's so frustrating. dang it!

286
00:18:38.744 --> 00:18:40.537
It was just…

287
00:18:42.831 --> 00:18:44.625
<i>I was just lucky!</i>

288
00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:48.003
<i>I just happened to be able to use</i>
<i>something I thought I could use.</i>

289
00:18:48.587 --> 00:18:50.714
<i>What's amazing was my luck.</i>

290
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.425
<i>It was a lucky punch.</i>

291
00:18:56.386 --> 00:19:00.641
<i>My real ability will be tested after this.</i>

292
00:19:05.521 --> 00:19:06.939
This isn't how it was supposed to…

293
00:19:08.315 --> 00:19:09.733
I killed two birds with one stone!

294
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.235
I'm a genius!

295
00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:13.737
You're the worst!

296
00:19:15.239 --> 00:19:19.117
<i>The first game of the first-year stage</i>
<i>is finally over.</i>

297
00:19:19.952 --> 00:19:22.412

CLASS A: YUGA AOYAMA

317
00:19:55.028 --> 00:19:57.614
<i>The top 42</i>
<i>made it through to the next round.</i>

318
00:19:57.781 --> 00:20:00.367
<i>It's unfortunate. but don't worry</i>
<i>even if you didn't make it!</i>

319
00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:03.370
<i>We've prepared other chances</i>
<i>for you to shine.</i>

320
00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.457
<i>The real competition begins next!</i>

321
00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:10.460
<i>The press cavalry will be all over it!</i>

322
00:20:10.627 --> 00:20:12.212
<i>Give it your all!</i>

323
00:20:15.007 --> 00:20:18.802
<i>Now then. here is the second game.</i>
<i>I already know what it is.</i>

324
00:20:19.219 --> 00:20:22.055
<i>but what could it be?</i>

325
00:20:22.431 --> 00:20:25.767
<i>I just said it. and now here it is…</i>

326
00:20:26.768 --> 00:20:28.103
A cavalry battle?

327
00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.605
I'm bad at those…

328
00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:32.774
It's not an individual event.
so I wonder how it'll work…

329
00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:34.443
<i>Let me explain.</i>

330
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:39.865
<i>The participants can form teams</i>
<i>of two to four people as they wish.</i>

331
00:20:40.324 --> 00:20:43.493
<i>It's basically the same</i>
<i>as a regular cavalry battle.</i>

332
00:20:44.036 --> 00:20:45.746
<i>but the one thing that's different is…</i>

333
00:20:46.205 --> 00:20:47.623
<i>based on the results of the last game.</i>

334
00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:50.417
<i>each person</i>
<i>has been assigned a point value.</i>

335
00:20:50.751 --> 00:20:53.462
A point-based system
like the entrance exam. huh?

336
00:20:53.629 --> 00:20:54.963
That's easy to understand.

337
00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.256
In other words.

338
00:20:56.423 --> 00:20:59.218
each team is worth different points
depending on who's on the team!

339
00:20:59.384 --> 00:21:00.719
I see!

340
00:21:01.428 --> 00:21:04.223
<i>You guys don't hold back</i>
<i>even though I'm talking. huh?</i>

341
00:21:05.098 --> 00:21:09.436
<i>Yes. that's right! And the points assigned</i>
<i>go up by five starting from the bottom.</i>

342
00:21:09.603 --> 00:21:14.149
<i>So 42nd place gets five points.</i>
<i>and 41st gets ten points!</i>

343
00:21:15.025 --> 00:21:18.153
<i>And the point value</i>
<i>assigned to first place is…</i>

344
00:21:18.487 --> 00:21:19.655
<i>ten million!</i>

345
00:21:21.323 --> 00:21:23.742
Ten million?

346
00:21:24.243 --> 00:21:25.994
<i>Ten million. huh?</i>

347
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.581
<i>In other words. if you take down</i>
<i>the first place player's team…</i>

348
00:21:29.748 --> 00:21:33.043
<i>…you can stand at the top</i>
<i>no matter what place you're in!</i>

349
00:21:34.878 --> 00:21:35.879
<i>That's right.</i>

350
00:21:37.005 --> 00:21:38.674
<i>It's survival of the fittest.</i>

351
00:21:38.841 --> 00:21:41.593
<i>with a chance for those</i>
<i>at the bottom to overthrow the top!</i>

352
00:23:13.143 --> 00:23:14.520
PREVIEW

353
00:23:14.686 --> 00:23:17.481
<i>Let's talk about the next episode. Deku.</i>

354
00:23:17.648 --> 00:23:19.525
<i>The second round is the cavalry battle!</i>

355
00:23:19.691 --> 00:23:21.735
<i>Usually. four people fight as a team. but…</i>

356
00:23:21.902 --> 00:23:23.987
<i>No one wants to be on my team!</i>

357
00:23:24.488 --> 00:23:26.490
<i>Deku. you're lonely. huh?</i>

358
00:23:26.657 --> 00:23:28.367
<i>Did I get labeled a loner</i>
<i>without knowing it?</i>

359
00:23:28.534 --> 00:23:30.410
<i>Deku. you're lonely. huh?</i>

360
00:23:30.577 --> 00:23:32.204
<i>She said it twice!</i>

361
00:23:32.371 --> 00:23:34.122
<i>Next time. "Strategy. Strategy. Strategy"!</i>

362
00:23:34.289 --> 00:23:37.584
<i>Deku's tears will shoot out like a geyser!</i>

363
00:23:37.751 --> 00:23:38.961
Go beyond!

364
00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.631
Plus Ultra!
