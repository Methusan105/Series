1
00:00:02.044 --> 00:00:03.212
<i>The fifth match.</i>

2
00:00:03.754 --> 00:00:07.841
<i>the exam with Team Uraraka</i>
<i>and Aoyama against Thirteen.</i>

3
00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:09.551
<i>is in its final stages…</i>

4
00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:13.096
We were so close!

5
00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:16.350
Oh no. I won't let you get away!

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.435
<i>This isn't good. We'll get caught!</i>

7
00:00:18.602 --> 00:00:19.520
<i>Think!</i>

8
00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.104
<i>Think about how to get out of this!</i>

9
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:22.689
<i>Think!</i>

10
00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.317
<i>What would Deku do in a time like this…</i>

11
00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:26.360
Hey.

12
00:00:26.777 --> 00:00:28.028
Hold on! Right now. I'm--

13
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.198
You were thinking about what
Izuku Midoriya would do. weren't you?

14
00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:34.451
Do you…

15
00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:37.079
like him?

16
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.423
<i>You should not fight</i>
<i>on your opponent's field</i>

17
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.927
but on your own field. see?

18
00:00:55.514 --> 00:00:56.640
What?

19
00:00:56.807 --> 00:00:58.100
Whee

20
00:00:58.267 --> 00:00:59.893
and catch!

21
00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:09.361
<i>What I learned with Gunhead just</i>
<i>happened to come in handy right now!</i>

22
00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:31.717
<i>I am Izuku Midoriya. born Quirkless</i>

23
00:01:31.884 --> 00:01:34.344
<i>and a student at U.A. High.</i>

24
00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:37.848
<i>With the help of my friends. I will become</i>
<i>the greatest hero of all time!</i>

25
00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:39.391
<i>In </i>My Hero Academia<i>!</i>

26
00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:43.956
STRIPPING THE VARNISH

27
00:02:45.207 --> 00:02:48.335
<i>Team Aoyama and Uraraka have passed!</i>

28
00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:50.212
Nice judgment. Uraraka!

29
00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.674
I can't believe she thought to use
her opponent's power to get in close!

30
00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:54.716
Ribbit…

31
00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:59.471
To me. it looked like Ochaco
just happened to let go. though…

32
00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:00.722
Really?

33
00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:05.894
Yes. I wonder what she was talking
about with Aoyama right before she let go?

34
00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:09.648
Who knows? We can't hear
what they're saying over here.

35
00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:14.486
Uraraka passed. huh?
I don't expect any less.

36
00:03:14.653 --> 00:03:17.447
-Congrats to you and Yaoyorozu. too!
-Ribbit!

37
00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.242
Thanks. Midoriya.

38
00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:24.162
I wonder which team will
take the practical exam next?

39
00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.457
The sixth match
is Team Ashido and Kaminari.

40
00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:29.668
They will be up against Principal Nezu.

41
00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:32.462
The principal. huh?

42
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:35.048
I wonder how he'll fight…

43
00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:37.301
We must watch carefully.

44
00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:38.552
-Yeah.
-Ribbit.

45
00:03:40.137 --> 00:03:43.098
<i>Team Ashido and Kaminari. practical exam.</i>

46
00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:44.433
<i>Ready. go!</i>

47
00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:48.520
Kaminari. what do you wanna do?

48
00:03:48.687 --> 00:03:49.938
Basically. run.

49
00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:51.815
Even if we're found.
the principal's small.

50
00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:53.775
so I should be able to take
care of him with my electricity.

51
00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:55.986
Ashido. you shouldn't use your Quirk!

52
00:03:56.153 --> 00:03:58.071
It'll be bad if you melt the principal.

53
00:03:58.238 --> 00:03:59.406
Yeah. right?

54
00:04:02.993 --> 00:04:04.745
What's that sound?

55
00:04:05.204 --> 00:04:07.873
It's not the principal… is it?

56
00:04:12.336 --> 00:04:13.253
Run!

57
00:04:15.214 --> 00:04:17.507
Kaminari. what's going on?

58
00:04:17.673 --> 00:04:21.845
I don't know. but I'm sure
the principal's behind it!

59
00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:24.181
That's right.

60
00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:27.309
The principal's riding in the crane?

61
00:04:27.476 --> 00:04:29.853
But how is he attacking them?

62
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.022
He's so far away from them.

63
00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:34.483
It's probably with his forecasts.

64
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.526
Forecasts?

65
00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:40.322
Yes. What's more. he probably reached
those through sophisticated calculations.

66
00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:44.117
What chain reaction will be caused
depending on what I break where…

67
00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:50.082
Those calculations are
as easy as making a cup of tea.

68
00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:57.923
And you two aren't noticing

69
00:04:59.675 --> 00:05:04.304
<i>that the paths to the escape gate</i>
<i>are getting sealed off one by one.</i>

70
00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:07.349
Intellectual-type villains will sit back
and watch from the sidelines.

71
00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:13.522
<i>Principal Nezu. Quirk: High Specs.</i>

72
00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:16.775
<i>He's an animal with a Quirk</i>
<i>that makes him smarter than humans!</i>

73
00:05:17.401 --> 00:05:20.737
<i>He's a unique being that you won't find</i>
<i>anywhere else in the world!</i>

74
00:05:22.865 --> 00:05:26.869
Humans did a bunch of experiments
on Nezu in the past.

75
00:05:27.286 --> 00:05:29.997
so in times like this. he can't
help but let out his true self.

76
00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.250
Kaminari. you can't do
anything with your electricity?

77
00:05:33.417 --> 00:05:36.545
I don't know where he is.
so I can't waste my shots.

78
00:05:36.712 --> 00:05:38.547
Do you want a dead weight on your hands?

79
00:05:38.714 --> 00:05:40.007
Anyway. all we can do is run!

80
00:05:40.174 --> 00:05:41.717
Which way's the escape gate?

81
00:05:41.884 --> 00:05:43.468
Probably… this way!

82
00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:48.807
No way!

83
00:05:54.563 --> 00:05:56.148
Is he trying to bury us alive?

84
00:05:56.607 --> 00:05:58.483
There's still a way out!

85
00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.738
Come on. use your heads!
Think carefully! Rack your brains!

86
00:06:02.905 --> 00:06:04.239
Kaminari. this way!

87
00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:05.365
Okay!

88
00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:11.830
We'd end up taking a detour.

89
00:06:11.997 --> 00:06:14.041
but if we go out through
the other side to the escape gate…

90
00:06:18.504 --> 00:06:20.672
He's one step ahead
of everything they can think of.

91
00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:24.927
And they can't attack if they
don't know where the principal is.

92
00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:28.138
His plan is so completely perfect…

93
00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:32.768
In the end. they couldn't make it to
the escape gate before time ran out.

94
00:06:32.935 --> 00:06:33.894
and…

95
00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:39.149
<i>Team Ashido and Kaminari</i>
<i>retires due to running out of time.</i>

96
00:06:39.316 --> 00:06:41.318
-Damn it!
-Man!

97
00:06:43.487 --> 00:06:47.783
And I left one escape
route for you. too. Too bad.

98
00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:53.747
Kaminari… Ashido…

99
00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:56.667
They really couldn't do a thing.

100
00:06:57.084 --> 00:06:59.002
They must be very frustrated.

101
00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:03.257
What? Mina's team lost?

102
00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:07.386
Yes. The principal's
strategy was too perfect.

103
00:07:07.553 --> 00:07:10.556
Really? That's too bad!

104
00:07:11.557 --> 00:07:13.600
Uraraka. congratulations on passing!

105
00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:16.228
Thanks! You too. Iida!

106
00:07:16.395 --> 00:07:19.690
Ochaco. when you were
fighting against Thirteen.

107
00:07:19.857 --> 00:07:21.817
what were you talking to Aoyama about?

108
00:07:21.984 --> 00:07:23.819
Hm? We were talking about…

109
00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:26.989
Do you… like him?

110
00:07:28.824 --> 00:07:31.952
Nothing! That's not how it is!

111
00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:33.495
-What's the matter. Uraraka?
-That's not it! It's not!

112
00:07:33.662 --> 00:07:35.914
-Your face is red. Are you sick?
-It's not!

113
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:38.375
Something happened. huh. Ochaco?

114
00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:44.381
<i>Team Koda and Jiro. practical exam.</i>

115
00:07:44.548 --> 00:07:45.757
<i>Ready. go!</i>

116
00:07:47.426 --> 00:07:48.760
Let's avoid combat with Present Mic

117
00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:51.597
if possible
and head toward the escape gate.

118
00:07:52.014 --> 00:07:52.973
Sound good?

119
00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:55.225
All right. let's go!

120
00:07:56.643 --> 00:08:00.647
The practical exam matches up
students with the teachers

121
00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:02.357
they'd have the hardest time
with on purpose. right?

122
00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:03.567
Yes.

123
00:08:03.734 --> 00:08:06.361
It's easy to understand
Jiro and Koda's match up.

124
00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:07.529
Ribbit.

125
00:08:07.696 --> 00:08:09.865
They're up against Mr. Present Mic.

126
00:08:10.616 --> 00:08:12.701
The two of them have sound-related Quirks.

127
00:08:12.868 --> 00:08:15.871
What will they do against
a Quirk that drowns out sound?

128
00:08:17.206 --> 00:08:20.667
Come on. let's hurry up and finish this.

129
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.838
I don't like working with
<i>ardor</i> in an <i>arbor</i> like this.

130
00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:31.220
Yeah!

131
00:08:34.847 --> 00:08:36.265
So loud!

132
00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:41.104
Koda! You can control animals
with your Quirk. right?

133
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.440
Can't you get the birds
to attack him or something?

134
00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:46.151
EVEN IF I WANTED TO ORDER THEM TO DO THAT.

135
00:08:46.318 --> 00:08:47.194
PRESENT MIC'S VOICE

136
00:08:47.361 --> 00:08:48.529
WILL MAKE THE ANIMALS RUN AWAY!

137
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.282
Even if I plug my ears.
I feel like my eardrums would burst.

138
00:08:53.325 --> 00:08:55.619
<i>He's not just better…</i>

139
00:08:55.786 --> 00:08:57.829
<i>He's like a new and enhanced version!</i>

140
00:08:57.996 --> 00:08:59.456
<i>I can't even get close to him!</i>

141
00:08:59.915 --> 00:09:01.583
Even if we got close to him.

142
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.211
whether to handcuff him
or escape through the gate.

143
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:06.129
he's probably in front of the gate.

144
00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:08.006
so we wouldn't be able
to avoid fighting him.

145
00:09:08.924 --> 00:09:09.800
Hurry up and…

146
00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:12.845
come out!

147
00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:14.179
My ears!

148
00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:17.891
You coming yet?

149
00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:20.894
I can't take this anymore! I can't…

150
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.149
<i>Present Mic. Quirk: Voice.</i>

151
00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:29.820
<i>He's got crazy volume.</i>
<i>crazy high pitches. and crazy low tones.</i>

152
00:09:30.529 --> 00:09:31.738
<i>With his first cry.</i>

153
00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:34.283
<i>his parents and the delivery doctor</i>
<i>had blood coming out of their ears.</i>

154
00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:38.287
<i>By the way. the device on his neck</i>
<i>is a directional speaker.</i>

155
00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:43.584
Hurry up!

156
00:09:48.338 --> 00:09:50.924
If this keeps up. our eardrums'll be shot.

157
00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:52.134
What should we do?

158
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.596
An ant?

159
00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:00.726
Koda! Can you control bugs?

160
00:10:00.893 --> 00:10:02.853
There was a bug! A little ant.

161
00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:17.826
He's not good with bugs. huh?

162
00:10:17.993 --> 00:10:24.416
There you are!

163
00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:27.377
This isn't good… For now…

164
00:10:28.837 --> 00:10:29.755
Cancel out!

165
00:10:35.052 --> 00:10:37.262
What a cheap sound.

166
00:10:39.306 --> 00:10:41.058
Do you have a plan?

167
00:10:43.227 --> 00:10:46.230
-What should we--
-You coming yet?

168
00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:49.191
<i>We need some way to break out of this!</i>

169
00:10:49.358 --> 00:10:51.360
<i>At this rate. we won't even be able</i>
<i>to get close to him.</i>

170
00:10:51.527 --> 00:10:53.028
<i>What a joke!</i>

171
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:55.489
Koda…

172
00:10:55.656 --> 00:10:58.951
Just tell me if it's possible
for you to control bugs or not.

173
00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:01.453
IT'S POSSIBLE…

174
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.704
Then…

175
00:11:08.377 --> 00:11:09.920
Sorry. I know it's scary. but…

176
00:11:10.087 --> 00:11:12.548
Hey!

177
00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:14.842
He's too strong!

178
00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:16.718
I can't think of anything else!

179
00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:22.057
If you can do it. we might be able to win!

180
00:11:23.934 --> 00:11:27.312
You can do it. You want
to be a hero. don't you?

181
00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:31.149
If so. then let's pass this!

182
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.947
<i>Jiro's ears are…</i>

183
00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:42.411
<i>Because I've just been</i>
<i>running away. Jiro's…</i>

184
00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.336
<i>You got into U.A.?</i>

185
00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:54.089
As your mom. I'm so happy!

186
00:11:54.256 --> 00:11:56.967
Koji. you're amazing!

187
00:11:57.509 --> 00:12:01.221
<i>That's right. I got into</i>
<i>my dream school. U.A.!</i>

188
00:12:02.306 --> 00:12:04.433
<i>U.A.. where we're always moving forward!</i>

189
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:09.646
<i>That's right. my heart</i>
<i>should always be Plus Ultra!</i>

190
00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:11.023
Go on. little ones.

191
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:14.193
Now is the time to take out
the man responsible for the noise.

192
00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:16.028
-You can totally talk!
-Listen…

193
00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:23.327
What. are they planning
on hiding until time's up?

194
00:12:32.753 --> 00:12:35.339
<i>They're coming from underground.</i>
<i>where it's hard for sound to travel!</i>

195
00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:39.885
<i>This is why I hate forests!</i>

196
00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:46.642
That's hard even for a pro…

197
00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:49.144
Koda. that's harsh…

198
00:12:49.645 --> 00:12:51.897
How pathetic.
to be taken down by some bugs!

199
00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:56.693
<i>Team Koda and Jiro have passed!</i>

200
00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:01.698
EIGHTH MATCH
TEAM HAGAKURE AND SHOJI VS SNIPE

201
00:13:01.865 --> 00:13:04.660
Shoji. at this rate. we can't move at all!

202
00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:06.912
Calm down. it's just a diversion.

203
00:13:07.079 --> 00:13:09.915
Even so.
escaping will be a Herculean task.

204
00:13:10.082 --> 00:13:11.208
The only consolation

205
00:13:11.375 --> 00:13:14.211
is that our opponent's movements
are slowed by the weights.

206
00:13:14.962 --> 00:13:18.298
Now. let's see
who's better at hide-and-seek.

207
00:13:21.093 --> 00:13:22.511
A smoke bomb?

208
00:13:22.678 --> 00:13:23.846
Is he trying to obstruct our view?

209
00:13:24.555 --> 00:13:26.723
But he'll have to deal with it. too.

210
00:13:27.266 --> 00:13:29.101
However. I can feel your presence.

211
00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:39.611
Are you all right. Hagakure?

212
00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:42.197
Hagakure?

213
00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:46.618
So that's what she's doing.

214
00:13:49.872 --> 00:13:51.915
You're being too rash!

215
00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:05.345
Aren't you giving up a little too easily?

216
00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:07.973
Got him!

217
00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.183
When did you--

218
00:14:11.143 --> 00:14:12.019
Bounce?

219
00:14:12.186 --> 00:14:14.563
Mr. Snipe!

220
00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:17.691
It was a misunderstanding! It was beyond
my control! I didn't do it on purpose!

221
00:14:18.734 --> 00:14:22.070
<i>Team Hagukure and Shoji have passed!</i>

222
00:14:22.237 --> 00:14:26.325
As expected. Hagakure is a cut above
when it comes to covert activities!

223
00:14:26.909 --> 00:14:28.160
Shoji also did a good job

224
00:14:28.327 --> 00:14:31.121
helping by drawing Mr. Snipe's attention
away from her.

225
00:14:31.288 --> 00:14:32.247
-Ribbit.
-Yeah!

226
00:14:33.999 --> 00:14:36.627
<i>Team Mineta and Sero. practical exam.</i>

227
00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:37.711
<i>Ready. go!</i>

228
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.672
Deku. you're up next. right?

229
00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:42.716
You're not going to the exam area?

230
00:14:42.883 --> 00:14:48.388
Oh. yeah. it is. but I'll watch
everyone fight until the last minute.

231
00:14:48.764 --> 00:14:51.934
It's useful to see how
everyone's using their Quirks.

232
00:14:52.476 --> 00:14:54.728
but I also feel like I'm getting
strength from watching them.

233
00:14:55.312 --> 00:14:57.689
Everyone's really amazing.

234
00:14:57.856 --> 00:15:00.442
Even if they couldn't pass.
they fought until the end…

235
00:15:00.609 --> 00:15:03.445
They're all excellent
U.A. students who never give up!

236
00:15:03.612 --> 00:15:04.488
Yeah!

237
00:15:04.655 --> 00:15:06.365
-Well…
-There's one…

238
00:15:06.532 --> 00:15:08.992
Who's totally given up.

239
00:15:11.537 --> 00:15:12.663
Mineta?

240
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:16.375
Damn it! How can I take this stupid test?

241
00:15:16.542 --> 00:15:21.713
This is crap! It's completely unfair!
How can I take such an unfair test?

242
00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:25.217
But he was looking forward
to the training camp so much!

243
00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:27.636
Why is he so ready to run away?

244
00:15:27.803 --> 00:15:29.972
If it's gotten that far.
it might be hard for him…

245
00:15:30.764 --> 00:15:35.185
For this practical exam.
All Might. Mic. Cementoss.

246
00:15:35.352 --> 00:15:38.856
and Midnight are all especially hard.

247
00:15:40.649 --> 00:15:42.234
<i>Depending on the person.</i>

248
00:15:42.401 --> 00:15:45.112
<i>it isn't hard to imagine someone being</i>
<i>checkmated or feeling like they are.</i>

249
00:15:45.946 --> 00:15:48.365
<i>Midnight. Quirk: Somnambulist.</i>

250
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:52.244
<i>She can make people fall asleep</i>
<i>with the fragrance coming from her body.</i>

251
00:15:52.411 --> 00:15:55.122
<i>It works better on boys than girls!</i>

252
00:15:55.289 --> 00:15:57.332
<i>It's working. it's working.</i>

253
00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:03.380
Grape Juice. the gate's
in the opposite direction.

254
00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:08.302
Sero. damn it! I won't forgive you!

255
00:16:08.719 --> 00:16:10.095
Why is he crying blood?

256
00:16:10.262 --> 00:16:12.014
Maybe because he's jealous of Sero?

257
00:16:12.181 --> 00:16:14.391
Sero. you bastard!

258
00:16:17.436 --> 00:16:18.353
Look out!

259
00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.147
Don't get too close. Mineta!

260
00:16:30.199 --> 00:16:31.450
Chest!

261
00:16:31.617 --> 00:16:32.701
And--

262
00:16:33.327 --> 00:16:34.369
Knees!

263
00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:38.749
If Sero hadn't saved me. then I'd
be in that position right about now!

264
00:16:39.333 --> 00:16:40.459
Mineta…

265
00:16:40.918 --> 00:16:44.254
It might be hard for a kid
like that to survive in this place.

266
00:16:45.339 --> 00:16:46.632
What do you mean?

267
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:52.054
<i>U.A. is constantly preparing walls</i>
<i>and making the students overcome them.</i>

268
00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.807
<i>In order to keep overcoming</i>
<i>those walls without losing steam.</i>

269
00:16:55.974 --> 00:16:59.394
<i>the students need</i>
<i>a concrete goal to focus on.</i>

270
00:17:00.896 --> 00:17:03.899
It's not so easy a path that one
can climb it with vague feelings

271
00:17:04.066 --> 00:17:06.108
of wanting to be a hero.

272
00:17:06.777 --> 00:17:09.154
Even if they do become heroes.

273
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.616
people whose end goal is
to become a hero have no future.

274
00:17:14.785 --> 00:17:19.373
<i>In the end. is there a goal in</i>
<i>that child's heart that he can focus on?</i>

275
00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:31.009
I want to touch a woman's body…
I want to be popular with the ladies…

276
00:17:31.635 --> 00:17:32.886
He's very direct.

277
00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:37.766
What the heck? Why is my exam
the only one like this?

278
00:17:37.933 --> 00:17:41.520
Just one sniff and you'll fall
asleep and be forced to retire…

279
00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:44.523
Jeez!

280
00:17:45.023 --> 00:17:49.027
Mineta. did you really come
to U.A. wanting to be a hero?

281
00:17:50.863 --> 00:17:53.156
Shut up. what's wrong with that?

282
00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.535
What? No way. is it really true?

283
00:17:56.702 --> 00:17:59.037
Yeah. I'm serious! Wanna
go together next time?

284
00:17:59.204 --> 00:18:01.081
Yeah. sure!

285
00:18:05.544 --> 00:18:08.088
I wanted to be popular with girls.
That's why I wanted to be a hero.

286
00:18:09.506 --> 00:18:13.260
I thought that I'd be popular
once I became a hero.

287
00:18:18.599 --> 00:18:21.018
I thought that I'd be popular…

288
00:18:25.606 --> 00:18:30.527
I thought I'd stay enshrined
in front of the gate until time ran out.

289
00:18:30.694 --> 00:18:33.113
but I suppose that's too inconsiderate.

290
00:18:34.323 --> 00:18:38.327
If someone runs away from me screaming.

291
00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:41.455
my sadistic side starts
to throb so much I can't help it.

292
00:18:41.622 --> 00:18:45.959
This is it! The eyes of a predator
who's cornered its prey!

293
00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:49.129
You really are toeing
the line there. Midnight!

294
00:18:50.297 --> 00:18:52.925
That's right. whether it's through
your nose or your mouth…

295
00:18:53.091 --> 00:18:55.886
If you take just one breath.
it'll be over for you.

296
00:18:56.053 --> 00:18:58.222
What do you think
you can do in that state?

297
00:19:00.224 --> 00:19:02.643
That's right! You'd run. right?

298
00:19:03.727 --> 00:19:05.145
<i>That's not it.</i>

299
00:19:05.312 --> 00:19:10.651
<i>After coming to this school and having</i>
<i>a brush with death. I realized…</i>

300
00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:14.196
<i>It's not that they're cool</i>
<i>because they're heroes…</i>

301
00:19:14.738 --> 00:19:17.115
<i>They're heroes because they're cool!</i>

302
00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:20.035
<i>Right. Midoriya?</i>

303
00:19:22.246 --> 00:19:25.958
Just how long do you plan on keeping
that up while holding your breath?

304
00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:28.710
That's not it…

305
00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:35.467
It's not that I'm a fan
of pervy heroes like you!

306
00:19:36.134 --> 00:19:39.638
I ran away from the gate. and whined.

307
00:19:39.805 --> 00:19:43.433
and fanned your sadistic side
and drew you all the way here…

308
00:19:44.309 --> 00:19:48.063
I did all that in order to be cool!

309
00:19:49.273 --> 00:19:50.983
Are you saying you had me
in the palm of your hand?

310
00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:52.943
That's fine. I won't let you!

311
00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:57.239
YOUR FRAGRANCE WON'T WORK LIKE THIS!

312
00:19:57.781 --> 00:19:59.116
<i>Sero's Tape!</i>

313
00:19:59.616 --> 00:20:02.619
Can you fight
in that state of suffocation?

314
00:20:04.913 --> 00:20:06.874
There's no need to fight.

315
00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:11.086
Because my special move…

316
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.047
already worked!

317
00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:17.676
Grape Rush!

318
00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:23.557
You're pretty amazing.

319
00:20:25.017 --> 00:20:27.311
He got her stuck far away from the gate

320
00:20:27.477 --> 00:20:29.438
so her Somnambulist
wouldn't be able to reach!

321
00:20:29.938 --> 00:20:32.316
Oh. he's pretty clever.

322
00:20:32.774 --> 00:20:35.485
He had me completely fooled.

323
00:20:36.862 --> 00:20:38.071
<i>Thinking it through.</i>

324
00:20:38.614 --> 00:20:42.492
<i>wanting to be popular with girls</i>
<i>is also a goal one can focus on.</i>

325
00:20:46.997 --> 00:20:48.457
Jeez.

326
00:20:48.999 --> 00:20:51.668
<i>If you hadn't tried to save me.</i>

327
00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:54.463
<i>then I wouldn't have had</i>
<i>to work this hard.</i>

328
00:20:55.881 --> 00:20:59.134
<i>Just this once. we'll save</i>
<i>the boobs for another day!</i>

329
00:21:00.886 --> 00:21:04.348
<i>Team Mineta and Sero have passed!</i>

330
00:21:04.515 --> 00:21:06.141
All right. they passed!

331
00:21:06.308 --> 00:21:08.352
Mineta's plan worked!

332
00:21:08.519 --> 00:21:11.396
-Ribbit.
-Deku. it's your…

333
00:21:13.941 --> 00:21:15.901
<i>Mineta. congrats!</i>

334
00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.195
<i>I'll also try to become a great hero</i>

335
00:21:18.362 --> 00:21:20.781
<i>so that I won't lose</i>
<i>to the others in our clas…</i>

336
00:21:34.378 --> 00:21:36.421
<i>Team Midoriya and Bakugo.</i>

337
00:21:37.172 --> 00:21:38.423
<i>practical exam.</i>

338
00:21:38.882 --> 00:21:40.717
<i>Ready. go!</i>

339
00:23:13.101 --> 00:23:14.520
<i>Here's the preview!</i>

340
00:23:15.103 --> 00:23:18.232
<i>The last match of the practical exam</i>
<i>is Kacchan and me versus All Might!</i>

341
00:23:18.398 --> 00:23:20.526
<i>In order for us</i>
<i>to win against All Might…</i>

342
00:23:20.692 --> 00:23:22.236
