1
00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:34.845
What's that?

2
00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:39.099
Is this like the entrance exam
where the lesson's already started?

3
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:40.475
Don't move!

4
00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:46.315
Those are villains.

5
00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:53.155
Thirteen and Eraser Head. huh?

6
00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:57.201
The teacher's schedule
we received the other day

7
00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.912
said that All Might was
also supposed to be here.

8
00:02:01.163 --> 00:02:04.374
The trespassing the other day was
the work of these scumbags after all. huh?

9
00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:06.877
Where is he?

10
00:02:07.044 --> 00:02:10.881
I went through the trouble
of bringing this whole crowd. too…

11
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.427
All Might… The Symbol of Peace…

12
00:02:15.594 --> 00:02:17.137
I can't believe he's not here.

13
00:02:18.013 --> 00:02:20.849
I wonder if he'll come
if we kill some kids?

14
00:02:23.352 --> 00:02:26.104
<i>What the pro heroes fight against</i>

15
00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:29.107
<i>and what they face…</i>

16
00:02:32.903 --> 00:02:35.739
<i>is an extraordinary evil.</i>

17
00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:41.119
EPISODE TEN:
ENCOUNTER WITH THE UNKNOWN

18
00:02:42.663 --> 00:02:44.831
-What? Villains?
-No way…

19
00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:48.335
There's no way they could
get into a hero school!

20
00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:51.213
Teacher. what about
the trespasser sensors?

21
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.674
<i>We have them. of course. but…</i>

22
00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:58.387
Did they only appear here.
or around the whole school?

23
00:02:58.971 --> 00:03:01.682
Either way.
if the sensors are not responding.

24
00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.477
that means they have someone
with a Quirk that can do that.

25
00:03:06.103 --> 00:03:08.522
An isolated area separated
from the main campus

26
00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.608
during a time when a class
is supposed to be here.

27
00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.736
They might be fools.
but they're not dumb.

28
00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:19.908
This surprise attack was carefully
planned with some sort of goal in mind.

29
00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:24.788
Thirteen. start the evacuation.

30
00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:26.081
Try calling the school.

31
00:03:26.957 --> 00:03:29.585
These villains even had something
to counteract the sensors.

32
00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:32.379
It's possible someone with
radio-wave-type powers is interfering.

33
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:34.715
Kaminari. You try contacting
the school with your Quirk. too.

34
00:03:34.882 --> 00:03:35.757
Yessir.

35
00:03:36.258 --> 00:03:38.385
What about you. sir?
Will you fight by yourself?

36
00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:41.638
With that many.
even if you can erase their Quirks…

37
00:03:42.181 --> 00:03:44.141
Eraser Head's fighting style

38
00:03:44.308 --> 00:03:46.894
is capturing
after erasing the enemy's Quirk.

39
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.437
A frontal battle is…

40
00:03:49.188 --> 00:03:51.440
You can't be a hero
with just one trick.

41
00:03:53.192 --> 00:03:55.277
I'm leaving it to you. Thirteen.

42
00:03:58.864 --> 00:04:00.199
Shooting squad. let's go.

43
00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:03.952
Didn't our intel say it would just be
Thirteen and All Might?

44
00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:05.621
-Who's that?
-I don't know!

45
00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:08.999
But if he thinks he can come
at us from the front by himself…

46
00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:10.542
then he's a huge idiot!

47
00:04:12.878 --> 00:04:15.631
-Huh? My Quirk…
-The bullets won't come out?

48
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.680
Idiot. he's Eraser Head!

49
00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:26.517
He can erase Quirks
just by looking at them!

50
00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:27.643
Erase?

51
00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:31.980
Are you gonna erase the Quirks of
heteromorphic-type villains like us. too?

52
00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:33.815
No. I can't.

53
00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:38.862
But the skills of guys like you…

54
00:04:40.322 --> 00:04:43.116
are statistically more likely
to manifest

55
00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:44.618
in close combat…

56
00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:48.997
so I've taken measures against that.

57
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.834
<i>He's also strong</i>
<i>in hand-to-hand combat.</i>

58
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.087
<i>and since he's hiding his eyes</i>
<i>with goggles.</i>

59
00:04:55.254 --> 00:04:58.006
<i>you can't tell</i>
<i>whose Quirk he's erasing.</i>

60
00:04:58.924 --> 00:05:00.509
<i>When he fights against a group.</i>

61
00:05:00.676 --> 00:05:02.761
<i>that makes it harder for them</i>
<i>to work together.</i>

62
00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:07.766
<i>I see.</i>

63
00:05:08.267 --> 00:05:12.771
I hate pro heroes. The masses
don't stand a chance against them.

64
00:05:17.234 --> 00:05:18.110
Wow…

65
00:05:18.944 --> 00:05:21.864
Mr. Aizawa's actually good at fighting
by himself against a lot of people. huh?

66
00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:23.991
This is no time for analysis!

67
00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:25.617
Hurry up and take shelter!

68
00:05:34.418 --> 00:05:36.211
I won't let you.

69
00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:40.757
<i>Shoot! I just blinked once and the guy</i>
<i>who looks like the most trouble got away…</i>

70
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:47.514
Nice to meet you.
We are the League of Villains.

71
00:05:48.182 --> 00:05:52.060
It may be presumptuous of us.
but we have invited ourselves in

72
00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:55.022
to the home of the heroes.
U.A. High School.

73
00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.777
in order to have All Might.
the Symbol of Peace. take his last breath.

74
00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:03.155
Huh?

75
00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:07.326
I believe All Might
should have been here.

76
00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:12.247
Has there been some kind of change?

77
00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:17.753
Well. that is neither here nor there.
This is the part I am to play.

78
00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:29.640
Did you consider that you'd get beaten
by us before you did it?

79
00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:36.063
Oh dear. that was close.

80
00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:41.860
That's right. Even if you are students.
you are excellent golden eggs.

81
00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:44.029
<i>No! Move away. you two!</i>

82
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.741
My job is to scatter you all

83
00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:50.494
and torture you to death!

84
00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:52.412
What the…

85
00:06:57.543 --> 00:06:58.794
Ribbit…

86
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.885
Everyone!

87
00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:19.106
<i>A warp?</i>

88
00:07:19.273 --> 00:07:21.191
<i>Is that his Quirk?</i>

89
00:07:21.859 --> 00:07:23.694
<i>They want to kill All Might?</i>

90
00:07:23.861 --> 00:07:26.446
<i>What in the world is going on?</i>

91
00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:28.240
<i>What the heck?</i>

92
00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:33.912
Here he comes!

93
00:07:34.997 --> 00:07:37.040
I don't have anything against you.

94
00:07:37.708 --> 00:07:38.917
but see ya!

95
00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:42.171
Midoriya!

96
00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:43.255
Ribbit!

97
00:07:44.965 --> 00:07:46.383
See ya…

98
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.051
See ya.

For a frog…

101
00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:09.781
your boobs… are pretty big.

102
00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:11.033
Ribbit.

103
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.997
Thanks. Asui.

104
00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:20.000
Call me "Tsu."

105
00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:23.420
<i>Tsuyu Asui! Quirk: Frog.</i>

106
00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:27.299
<i>She can do pretty much anything</i>
<i>a frog can! As expected!</i>

107
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.511
This has turned
into a bad situation. though.

108
00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:33.304
Yeah. What the villain said earlier…

109
00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:37.017
All Might should have been here.

110
00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:40.562
Has there been some kind of change?

111
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.066
They knew U.A.'s schedule!

112
00:08:44.775 --> 00:08:45.859
<i>Looking at the big picture.</i>

113
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.863
<i>those guys must've set up the media</i>
<i>intrusion the other day</i>

114
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.448
<i>to get information.</i>

115
00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:56.828
They were waiting to pounce.
just as Todoroki said.

116
00:08:56.995 --> 00:08:58.497
But. but…

117
00:08:58.664 --> 00:09:01.333
It's not like they can kill All Might!

118
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.878
Once All Might comes.
he'll pound those guys!

119
00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:06.797
-Mineta.
-Huh?

120
00:09:06.964 --> 00:09:11.218
Don't you think they are trying so hard
because they have a way to kill him?

121
00:09:12.636 --> 00:09:17.057
Guys that strong just told us
they would torture us to death. you know.

122
00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:22.229
I wonder if we'll be able to hold out
until All Might arrives…

123
00:09:22.396 --> 00:09:24.481
Even if All Might comes.

124
00:09:24.648 --> 00:09:26.900
I wonder if we will all make it out
in one piece…

125
00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.028
Midoriya!

126
00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:31.738
What the heck is that?

127
00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:33.407
Ribbit!

128
00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:37.452
You bastard! I'll kill you!

129
00:09:39.246 --> 00:09:42.332
There's a ton of them!

130
00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:47.254
<i>Those guys have a way to defeat All Might.</i>

131
00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:49.006
<i>She's probably right about that.</i>

132
00:09:49.173 --> 00:09:51.758
<i>I can't think of any other possibility.</i>

133
00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:53.677
<i>Why do they want to kill him?</i>

134
00:09:53.844 --> 00:09:57.556
<i>Because he's become a person</i>
<i>who deters villains and evil?</i>

135
00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:00.726
<i>Because he's the one and only</i>
<i>Symbol of Peace?</i>

136
00:10:04.897 --> 00:10:07.107
<i>No. I mean…</i>

137
00:10:07.608 --> 00:10:10.068
You can become a hero.

138
00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:13.155
I like that!

139
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:17.159
<i>Right now. I don't…</i>

140
00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:19.786
<i>Come. young Midoriya.</i>

141
00:10:20.746 --> 00:10:22.164
Congrats on getting accepted.

142
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.625
<i>I don't…</i>

143
00:10:25.459 --> 00:10:27.878
<i>It's fine now. Why?</i>

144
00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:30.088
<i>Because I am here.</i>

145
00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:33.926
<i>I don't care about why!</i>

146
00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.888
-If those guys…
-Ribbit.

147
00:10:38.931 --> 00:10:41.725
…have a way to defeat All Might.

148
00:10:41.892 --> 00:10:46.563
then right now. we should be
stopping whatever they're planning.

149
00:10:48.065 --> 00:10:50.734
By fighting and winning!

150
00:10:57.449 --> 00:10:59.743
It's pathetic to lose
against a single child.

151
00:11:00.744 --> 00:11:03.455
Get a hold of yourself.
You're an adult. aren't you?

152
00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:07.459
COLLAPSE ZONE

00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:55.674
<i>is not in service. or has been</i>
<i>temporarily disconnected.</i>

158
00:11:58.594 --> 00:12:01.638
I can't reach Thirteen or Aizawa…

159
00:12:03.015 --> 00:12:06.101
Whatever the reason.
I am neglecting my teaching duties

160
00:12:06.268 --> 00:12:08.270
because of what happened
outside of work hours.

161
00:12:08.437 --> 00:12:10.647
I did something very foolish.

162
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.234
What if I go say something at the end?

163
00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:17.112
My body will last
for another ten minutes or so.

164
00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:23.327
I will g…

165
00:12:25.204 --> 00:12:26.205
Hold your horses.

166
00:12:28.332 --> 00:12:29.791
Principal Nezu!

167
00:12:30.209 --> 00:12:35.547
Yes! Am I a mouse? A dog?
A bear? My real identity is…

168
00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:36.924
the principal!

169
00:12:38.175 --> 00:12:41.178
Your fur is well-groomed today. as usual.

170
00:12:41.345 --> 00:12:42.804
The secret is keratin.

171
00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:45.849
Humans can't get
this kind of color and luster.

172
00:12:46.016 --> 00:12:48.101
But let's talk about that later.

173
00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:50.270
Look at this!

174
00:12:50.812 --> 00:12:54.775
"All Might resolves three incidents
in only one hour!"

00:12:57.528 --> 00:12:59.905

<i>who still cause trouble</i>

00:13:00.072 --> 00:13:01.949
<i>in this town even with you here.</i>

177
00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:05.702
<i>but you also shouldn't react</i>
<i>every time you hear of an incident!</i>

178
00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:08.872
You really haven't changed at all.
have you?

179
00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:10.541
Your hero activities are limited

180
00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:12.668
because of your injury
and its aftereffects.

181
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:17.214
Along with that. you need to train
your One For All successor.

182
00:13:17.381 --> 00:13:19.633
Since you insist on remaining
the Symbol of Peace.

183
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.470
the only way you can keep the world
from finding out about both of those

184
00:13:23.637 --> 00:13:24.930
is for you to come here.

185
00:13:25.097 --> 00:13:27.641
That's why I suggested
you become a teacher.

186
00:13:29.977 --> 00:13:33.188
I think you can stay here
and relax for a little longer.

187
00:13:34.398 --> 00:13:38.235
In actuality. you can only teach
this next class for a little bit. right?

188
00:13:38.402 --> 00:13:40.279
I'm the one who suggested it.

189
00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:42.781
but since you've accepted the position.

190
00:13:42.948 --> 00:13:45.617
I wish you'd prioritize
your teaching duties.

191
00:13:45.784 --> 00:13:49.204
I mean. there are
a lot of hero agencies in this town.

192
00:13:49.371 --> 00:13:50.873
It is as you say.

193
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:55.335
But that is why
I was preparing to go to USJ.

194
00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:58.005
Even if you went now. you would
be forced to return right away. right?

195
00:13:58.547 --> 00:14:01.466
If that's the case. then you might as well
listen to my theories on teaching

196
00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:04.761
-and use that to help you in the future.
<i>-He's pouring tea…</i>

197
00:14:06.847 --> 00:14:07.764
Have a drink.

198
00:14:08.307 --> 00:14:11.143
<i>He's always been long-winded.</i>

199
00:14:12.311 --> 00:14:16.148
<i>What bothers me most is that I didn't get</i>
<i>a voicemail and couldn't connect at all…</i>

200
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.610
First of all. regarding the vulnerability
and responsibility

201
00:14:19.776 --> 00:14:21.820
of being both hero and teacher…

202
00:14:21.987 --> 00:14:25.032
You haven't changed at all either. sir.

203
00:14:31.413 --> 00:14:33.707
Shoji. is everyone here?

204
00:14:33.874 --> 00:14:35.459
Can you check?

205
00:14:35.626 --> 00:14:39.171
Everyone's scattered.
but they're all in this building.

206
00:14:41.465 --> 00:14:44.134
Damn it. physical attacks
can't hit him. and he can warp things…

207
00:14:44.301 --> 00:14:46.053
His Quirk's the worst!

208
00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.098
<i>-Class rep!</i>
-Yes?

209
00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:51.808
<i>I entrust this duty to you.</i>

210
00:14:51.975 --> 00:14:54.978
Run to the school and tell them
about what is happening here.

211
00:14:55.896 --> 00:14:59.608
<i>The alarms are not sounding.</i>
<i>and our phones don't have signal.</i>

212
00:14:59.775 --> 00:15:02.194
<i>The alarm system</i>
<i>is based on infrared rays.</i>

213
00:15:02.361 --> 00:15:04.488
<i>Even though Eraser Head</i>

214
00:15:04.655 --> 00:15:07.866
<i>is erasing people's Quirks</i>
<i>left and right.</i>

215
00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:09.368
<i>they are still not working.</i>

216
00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:13.247
<i>which means they must have someone</i>
<i>with an interference Quirk</i>

217
00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:14.873
<i>who hid right when they arrived.</i>

218
00:15:15.541 --> 00:15:19.253
<i>It would be faster for you to run</i>
<i>than for us to find that person.</i>

219
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:22.506
But it would be a disgrace as class rep
to leave everyone behind…

220
00:15:22.673 --> 00:15:24.174
Go. Emergency Exit!

221
00:15:24.716 --> 00:15:26.343
If you can get outside. there are alarms.

222
00:15:26.844 --> 00:15:29.847
That's why these guys
are only doing this inside. right?

223
00:15:30.013 --> 00:15:32.099
As long as you go outside.
they won't follow you!

224
00:15:32.266 --> 00:15:35.060
Blow away this fog with your legs!

225
00:15:35.936 --> 00:15:38.313
<i>Use your Quirk in order to save others!</i>

226
00:15:41.108 --> 00:15:45.028
I can totally support you
like I did in the cafeteria!

227
00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:46.446
I will!

228
00:15:47.489 --> 00:15:49.199
Please. class rep!

229
00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.542
Even if you have no other choice.

230
00:15:58.709 --> 00:16:01.670
are there really idiots who talk
about their plans in front of the enemy?

231
00:16:02.171 --> 00:16:04.840
<i>We did it because it doesn't</i>
<i>matter if we're found out!</i>

232
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:09.011
<i>Black Hole!</i>

233
00:16:13.724 --> 00:16:15.809
What do you mean. fight? Are you stupid?

234
00:16:16.602 --> 00:16:19.062
These guys might kill All Might. right?

235
00:16:19.229 --> 00:16:21.231
You're contradicting yourself. Midoriya!

236
00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:23.692
The best plan would be to sit tight

237
00:16:23.859 --> 00:16:26.737
and wait for the U.A. heroes
to come save us. of course!

238
00:16:26.904 --> 00:16:31.783
Mineta. those guys down there are clearly
assuming we'll fight in the water. right?

239
00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.035
Are you ignoring me?

240
00:16:34.203 --> 00:16:36.288
Does that mean they knew
what was in these facilities

241
00:16:36.455 --> 00:16:37.998
before they gathered people?

242
00:16:38.165 --> 00:16:39.041
Yeah.

243
00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:43.921
For people who gathered
that much intel so meticulously.

244
00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:45.881
there's something strange.

245
00:16:46.048 --> 00:16:47.841
They sent you. Asu…

246
00:16:48.008 --> 00:16:48.926
Ribbit?

247
00:16:49.092 --> 00:16:52.804
I mean. Tsu…
to the shipwreck zone.

248
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:56.099
Your own pace is fine.

249
00:16:56.266 --> 00:16:57.392
Oh. is that right?

250
00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:59.102
Well. what about it?

251
00:17:00.437 --> 00:17:01.522
This means. in other words.

252
00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:04.191
the villains probably don't know
what our Quirks are.

253
00:17:04.983 --> 00:17:06.944
Ribbit. That's true…

254
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:10.321
If they knew that I was a frog.

255
00:17:10.489 --> 00:17:13.200
then they probably would have thrown me
into that fire zone over there.

256
00:17:13.742 --> 00:17:16.036
They probably separated us
because they didn't know our Quirks

257
00:17:16.203 --> 00:17:20.207
so they planned to overpower us
with numbers.

258
00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:23.460
We have inferior numbers
and less experience.

259
00:17:23.961 --> 00:17:25.462
Our only hope

260
00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:28.966
lies in the fact that our opponents
don't know what our Quirks are!

261
00:17:29.633 --> 00:17:31.718
The enemy isn't trying to climb the boat.

262
00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:33.720
That supports my hypothesis!

263
00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:39.935
But that probably means
they aren't underestimating us. either.

264
00:17:43.772 --> 00:17:46.900
I'll tell you more about my Quirk.

265
00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:51.154
I can jump high. stick to walls.

266
00:17:51.321 --> 00:17:54.908
and stick my tongue out
up to about twenty meters.

267
00:17:55.075 --> 00:17:59.246
I can also spit out my stomach
and wash it.

268
00:17:59.413 --> 00:18:03.417
and secrete toxic mucus
that actually just stings a little.

269
00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:05.919
<i>"Secrete"?</i>

270
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:10.382
The last two are practically useless.
so you can probably forget about them.

271
00:18:10.924 --> 00:18:13.719
I already kind of knew.
but you're really strong.

272
00:18:13.886 --> 00:18:15.762
I have super strength.
but once I use it.

273
00:18:16.555 --> 00:18:18.807
<i>I'm pretty much out of commission.</i>

274
00:18:18.974 --> 00:18:21.518
<i>It's like a double-edged sword.</i>

275
00:18:23.228 --> 00:18:26.690
My Quirk lets these stick super tight.

276
00:18:27.399 --> 00:18:30.444
Depending on how I'm feeling.
they can even stick for a whole day.

277
00:18:30.611 --> 00:18:32.988
They grow back after I pull them off.

278
00:18:33.155 --> 00:18:34.698
but if I pull off too many.
I'll start bleeding.

279
00:18:35.199 --> 00:18:38.202
They don't stick to me.
They just bounce off.

280
00:18:47.503 --> 00:18:51.298
That's why I said
we should just wait quietly!

281
00:18:51.465 --> 00:18:54.009
My Quirk is totally unfit for battle!

282
00:18:54.176 --> 00:18:55.427
That's not it!

283
00:18:55.594 --> 00:18:58.180
It's an amazing Quirk.
so we should think of a way to use it…

284
00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:05.729
I'm getting impatient.
Let's end this quickly!

285
00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.023
What power…

286
00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:10.275
The ship's broken.

287
00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:12.945
You can't give up!

288
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:20.160
What are you doing?
The enemy will figure out your Quirk…

289
00:19:20.661 --> 00:19:21.787
What the heck are these?

290
00:19:21.954 --> 00:19:23.705
They're being cautious
and not touching them?

291
00:19:26.792 --> 00:19:29.503
The boat will sink in less than a minute.

292
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.256
Once they get into the water.
we're sure to win.

293
00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:34.591
That's true…

294
00:19:34.967 --> 00:19:38.095
Mineta. did you really enter U.A.
to become a hero?

295
00:19:38.262 --> 00:19:40.973
Shut up! It's weirder
to not be scared right now!

296
00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:43.517
We were only in junior high
until a little while ago!

297
00:19:43.684 --> 00:19:46.728
Who would've thought that we would be
almost killed right after starting school?

298
00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:50.566
I wish I could've at least
touched Yaoyorozu's boobs first!

299
00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:52.568
When the enemy…

300
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:56.864
When the enemy becomes certain
of their victory. that will be our chance.

301
00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:01.034
<i>All Might said so before on TV.</i>

302
00:20:02.119 --> 00:20:03.453
What?

303
00:20:05.706 --> 00:20:06.999
This is the only way…

304
00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:08.709
to win!

305
00:20:14.548 --> 00:20:17.718
You really must be kids.
with all the chirping and screaming.

306
00:20:17.885 --> 00:20:21.263
Hey. Shigaraki said just
don't let down your guard. remember?

307
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:24.308
Don't judge them by their ages.
Look at their Quirks.

308
00:20:24.474 --> 00:20:25.601
It's common sense. isn't it?

309
00:20:26.977 --> 00:20:31.440
Because our Quirks will definitely
have an advantage in the water.

310
00:20:35.027 --> 00:20:38.113
<i>-Act like Kacchan…</i>
-You serious. Midoriya?

311
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.990
Die!

312
00:20:40.157 --> 00:20:41.909
He's a kid after all.

313
00:20:43.827 --> 00:20:47.206
<i>Even if it's a smash. I can't get them</i>
<i>all at once if they form a circle.</i>

314
00:20:47.372 --> 00:20:49.374
<i>Anyway. even if we get through</i>
<i>this shipwreck zone.</i>

315
00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:50.918
<i>there are still other enemies.</i>

316
00:20:51.084 --> 00:20:52.336
<i>I can't sacrifice my arm!</i>

317
00:20:52.503 --> 00:20:54.421
After he hits the water…

318
00:20:54.588 --> 00:20:57.841
<i>Imagine… the egg not exploding!</i>

319
00:21:01.011 --> 00:21:02.429
Mineta…

320
00:21:04.139 --> 00:21:07.518
<i>Even though he's shaking…</i>
<i>Even though he's the same as me…</i>

321
00:21:07.684 --> 00:21:08.936
<i>Even though he's scared…</i>

322
00:21:09.102 --> 00:21:11.522
<i>Why?</i>

323
00:21:13.315 --> 00:21:15.692
Delaware Smash!

324
00:21:26.203 --> 00:21:28.664
Tsu! Mineta!

325
00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:30.874
Ribbit!

326
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:41.635
Damn it! What the heck. Midoriya?

327
00:21:42.427 --> 00:21:44.888
Why are you acting so cool?

328
00:21:47.391 --> 00:21:48.392
Even I…

329
00:21:48.809 --> 00:21:51.019
Even I can…!

330
00:21:52.729 --> 00:21:53.814
Hey!

331
00:21:53.981 --> 00:21:55.357
I'm getting dragged in…

332
00:21:57.526 --> 00:21:59.278
Is this that kid's?

333
00:21:59.444 --> 00:22:01.363
What is it? I can't get it off!

334
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:05.784
If a strong force is applied
to the surface of the water.

335
00:22:05.951 --> 00:22:07.035
it'll spread…

336
00:22:07.744 --> 00:22:10.247
and then converge back in the middle!

337
00:22:11.373 --> 00:22:12.374
-Move!
-Get away!

338
00:22:12.541 --> 00:22:13.917
-You too!
-You're in my way!

339
00:22:16.295 --> 00:22:17.880
Rounded everyone up at once.

340
00:22:18.839 --> 00:22:20.924
I guess it's like we've cleared

341
00:22:21.091 --> 00:22:23.051
the first hurdle.

342
00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.431
<i>You're both amazing!</i>

343
00:24:01.108 --> 00:24:02.401
NEXT TIME

344
00:24:02.568 --> 00:24:06.321
<i>Everyone. do your best</i>
<i>until Iida comes back with help!</i>

345
00:24:06.488 --> 00:24:08.699
