00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.760
That's mean. Kacchan.

2
00:00:09.927 --> 00:00:11.553
Can't you see he's crying?

3
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.097
If you keep going.

4
00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:16.642
I'll never forgive you!

5
00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:21.355
Even though you're Quirkless.

6
00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:25.817
you're pretending to be a hero. Deku?

7
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:43.544
<i>All men are not created equal.</i>

8
00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:52.010
<i>This was the reality I learned</i>
<i>about society at the young age of four.</i>

9
00:00:53.512 --> 00:00:58.267
<i>And that was my first and last setback.</i>

IZUKU MIDORIYA

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:19.788
TATOOIN STATION

12
00:01:20.956 --> 00:01:22.833
That's a huge villain!

13
00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:59.596
<i>It all began in China. in Qingqing City.</i>

14
00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:03.267
<i>There was news that a baby</i>
<i>that gave off light was born.</i>

15
00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:05.519
PAPA

16
00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:09.314
<i>Ever since then. superpowers</i>
<i>were discovered in various places.</i>

17
00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:12.484
<i>and time passed without</i>
<i>the cause being identified.</i>

18
00:03:13.652 --> 00:03:16.905
<i>Before we knew it.</i>
<i>the supernatural became normal.</i>

19
00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:19.157
<i>and dreams became reality.</i>

20
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.661
<i>The world has become</i>
<i>a superhuman society.</i>

21
00:03:22.828 --> 00:03:26.415
<i>and about 80% of the world's population</i>
<i>now has some kind of special trait.</i>

22
00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:29.710
<i>In this world swirling with chaos.</i>

23
00:03:29.877 --> 00:03:33.338
<i>the profession that everyone</i>
<i>once dreamed about and admired</i>

24
00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:35.382
<i>came into the limelight.</i>

25
00:03:40.304 --> 00:03:41.388
<i>That profession is…</i>

26
00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:51.690
Oh. it's Death Arms!

27
00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.234
He carries out justice
through his great physical strength!

28
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:55.944
The Punching Hero!

29
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:04.494
Everyone. this is dangerous.
Stay back. stay back!

30
00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:08.665
The rescue specialist. Backdraft.
is here. too!

31
00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:14.046
But man. turning into a monster's
an amazing Quirk.

32
00:04:14.213 --> 00:04:15.547
What did he do?

33
00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:19.009
He stole someone's bag and
went out of control when he was cornered.

34
00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:21.428
A Quirk like that.
and he's a bag snatcher?

35
00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:23.931
I'm sorry. the train's…

36
00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:27.392
Yes. I don't know what time
I will make it into work…

37
00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:30.729
You can do it. Kamui!

38
00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:38.362
Get away!

39
00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:41.907
Who's fighting?

40
00:04:46.203 --> 00:04:47.829
Kamui Woods!

41
00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:54.795
The young and talented rising star!

42
00:04:54.962 --> 00:04:57.464
You were the one asking.
but you gave a perfect commentary. kid.

43
00:04:57.631 --> 00:04:58.590
You're a fanboy. aren't you?

44
00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:00.259
Uh. well…

45
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.904
Illegal use of powers during rush hour
and robbery resulting in bodily injury.

46
00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:23.824
You are the incarnation of evil.

47
00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:27.828
Oh. here it comes!

48
00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:29.997
Show us something flashy. Tree-Man!

49
00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:31.874
Pre-emptive…

50
00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:33.834
Binding…

51
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:36.044
…Lacquered Chain Prison!

52
00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:37.629
Canyon Cannon!

53
00:05:45.262 --> 00:05:46.263
Huh?

54
00:05:51.268 --> 00:05:53.562
Here it is.

55
00:05:54.438 --> 00:05:57.399
Today is the day of my debut!

56
00:05:57.566 --> 00:05:59.985
My name is Mt. Lady.

57
00:06:00.152 --> 00:06:02.571
A pleasure
to make your ass-quaintance.

58
00:06:02.738 --> 00:06:06.491
Here it is.

59
00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:09.161
She's getting the credit…

60
00:06:10.746 --> 00:06:15.000
<i>Along with the superpowers</i>
<i>came an explosive increase in crime.</i>

61
00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:18.629
<i>As the country was stuck in the</i>
<i>slow progress of drastic law reforms.</i>

62
00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:22.883
<i>courageous people started performing</i>
<i>heroic acts from out of comic books.</i>

63
00:06:24.176 --> 00:06:27.513
<i>Guarding against superpowers</i>
<i>and defending against evil.</i>

64
00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:30.807
<i>Heroes were soon accepted</i>
<i>by the public.</i>

65
00:06:30.974 --> 00:06:33.685
<i>and it was established</i>
<i>as an official position.</i>

66
00:06:34.353 --> 00:06:38.941
<i>Based on their performance.</i>
<i>they are paid by the government</i>

67
00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:40.776
<i>and gain renown</i>
<i>among the masses.</i>

68
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:45.572
Gigantification. huh?

69
00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:48.158
She looks like she'll be popular.
and it's an amazing Quirk.

70
00:06:48.325 --> 00:06:50.744
but thinking about the damage to the city
that'll go hand in hand with that.

71
00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:53.372
its use might be limited?

72
00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:55.499
No. but whether or not
she can control the size…

73
00:06:55.666 --> 00:06:58.210
Hey wait. you're taking notes?
You wanna be a hero?

74
00:06:58.377 --> 00:06:59.670
That's great! You can do it!

75
00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.716
Yes! I'll do my best!

76
00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:08.720
EPISODE ONE
IZUKU MIDORIYA: ORIGIN

77
00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:11.598
ALDERA JUNIOR HIGH

78
00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:13.934
Since you're all third years.

79
00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:16.854
it's time for you
to think seriously about your future.

80
00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:19.940
I'll pass out handouts
for your future plans now. but…

81
00:07:21.108 --> 00:07:22.734
you're all…

82
00:07:25.696 --> 00:07:27.781
pretty much planning to go
into the hero course. right?

83
00:07:27.948 --> 00:07:29.741
Yes!

84
00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:32.494
Yes. yes.
you all have wonderful Quirks!

85
00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:36.081
But using your powers
at school is against the rules!

86
00:07:36.248 --> 00:07:37.457
Teach!

87
00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:40.669
Don't lump us all in the same group.

88
00:07:40.836 --> 00:07:45.382
I'm not gonna be stuck at the bottom
with the rest of these rejects!

89
00:07:45.549 --> 00:07:48.010
KATSUKI BAKUGO

90
00:07:48.177 --> 00:07:50.804
-That was uncalled for. Katsuki!
-Yeah. yeah!

91
00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:52.598
You all should shut up
like the extras you are!

92
00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:55.017
Oh. if I remember correctly.

93
00:07:55.184 --> 00:07:57.269
you want to go to U.A. High.
right. Bakugo?

94
00:07:57.436 --> 00:07:59.396
U.A.? That national school?

95
00:07:59.563 --> 00:08:01.440
It was in the top 0.2% this year.
you know!

96
00:08:01.607 --> 00:08:03.108
Their acceptance rate's
always really low. too!

97
00:08:03.275 --> 00:08:05.777
That's exactly why
you guys are just extras!

98
00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:09.406
I aced the mock test!

99
00:08:09.573 --> 00:08:12.159
I'm the only one at this school
who could possibly get into U.A.

100
00:08:13.035 --> 00:08:15.495
<i>I'll definitely surpass All Might</i>

101
00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:19.041
and become the top hero!

102
00:08:19.208 --> 00:08:21.919
My name'll be inscribed
on the list of top earners!

103
00:08:22.503 --> 00:08:24.963
Oh yeah. Midoriya
wanted to go to U.A.. too. right?

104
00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:32.929
Huh? Midoriya? No way!

105
00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:35.765
You can't get into the hero course
just by studying!

106
00:08:35.933 --> 00:08:39.186
They got rid of that rule!
There's just no precedent…

107
00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:44.066
Hey. Deku!

108
00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:48.195
You're below the rejects!
You're Quirkless!

109
00:08:48.362 --> 00:08:51.240
How can you even stand
in the same ring as me?

110
00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:53.784
No. wait. Kacchan!

111
00:08:53.951 --> 00:08:56.828
It's not like I'm trying
to compete with you or anything!

112
00:08:56.995 --> 00:08:57.996
Believe me!

113
00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:02.709
It's just that it's been my goal
ever since I was little.

114
00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:04.586
And well.

115
00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:06.505
I won't know unless I try.

116
00:09:06.672 --> 00:09:09.633
Whaddaya mean.
unless you try?

117
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.885
Are you taking the test for fun?

118
00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:14.471
What the hell can you do?

119
00:09:14.638 --> 00:09:16.557
You're Quirkless!

120
00:09:20.352 --> 00:09:23.897
12:02 P.M. - THE SAME CITY

121
00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:26.066
Thief!

122
00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:27.818
Someone!

123
00:09:28.694 --> 00:09:31.363
Catch me if you can!

124
00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:35.450
Huh? There's no hero around.

125
00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:38.328
Normally someone
would come right away.

126
00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:41.039
This guy's taking advantage
of the chaos from this morning.

127
00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:42.791
There are tons of people around

128
00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.793
who don't know what to do
with their Quirks.

129
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.628
There's no end to them.

130
00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:49.590
There is an end.

131
00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:54.386
Why?

132
00:09:58.891 --> 00:10:00.851
Because I am here!

133
00:10:12.196 --> 00:10:13.614
Hey. let's go to karaoke!

134
00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.616
Sure. nothing better to do.

135
00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:18.619
The incident this morning
is all over the headlines!

136
00:10:19.203 --> 00:10:22.247
I wanna hurry up and go home
so I can write it down in my notebook.

137
00:10:25.751 --> 00:10:28.253
We're not done talking yet. Deku.

138
00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:30.631
Katsuki. what's that?

139
00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:35.469
Huh? "Hero Analysis for the Future"?

140
00:10:35.636 --> 00:10:36.970
Seriously?

141
00:10:37.888 --> 00:10:39.223
Midoriya…

142
00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:41.141
It's fine. isn't it? Give it back!

143
00:10:44.937 --> 00:10:46.355
That's mean…

144
00:10:46.522 --> 00:10:47.689
What?

145
00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:51.485
Most top first-string heroes

146
00:10:51.652 --> 00:10:53.946
have stories about them
from their school days.

147
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.283
I want the shine
of being able to be called

148
00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.702
the only student
to make it into U.A.

149
00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:02.829
from this mediocre city
junior high school.

150
00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:05.374
I mean. I'm a perfectionist.

151
00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:07.376
He's so petty.

152
00:11:08.794 --> 00:11:10.838
So anyway.

153
00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:14.842
don't apply to U.A.. nerd.

154
00:11:20.556 --> 00:11:23.851
Come on. you could at least
say something back.

155
00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:29.231
Don't say that. He's pathetic.
He still can't face reality.

156
00:11:31.233 --> 00:11:35.070
If you wanna be a hero that badly.
there's a quick way to do it.

157
00:11:35.821 --> 00:11:38.156
Believe that you'll be born
with a Quirk in your next life

158
00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:40.450
and take a last chance dive
off the roof!

159
00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:46.790
What?

160
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:59.469
<i>Idiot! If I really jumped. that would mean</i>
<i>you instigated a suicide!</i>

161
00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:01.221
<i>Think before you speak!</i>

162
00:12:03.557 --> 00:12:05.726
That's not fish food. stupid.

163
00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:09.730
That's my notebook…

164
00:12:09.897 --> 00:12:10.939
Stupid…

165
00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:14.568
HERO ANALYSIS FOR THE FUTURE

166
00:12:14.735 --> 00:12:16.195
Stupid bastard…

167
00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:19.781
<i>Mom!</i>

168
00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:24.661
Mom. the computer!

169
00:12:24.828 --> 00:12:26.288
Again?

170
00:12:27.623 --> 00:12:29.416
Hurry!

171
00:12:30.042 --> 00:12:32.544
Jeez. you've probably added
ten thousand views

172
00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:34.254
just by yourself. Izuku.

173
00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:36.423
It's too scary for me. I can't watch it.

174
00:12:38.217 --> 00:12:40.135
<i>That was an old video.</i>

175
00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:43.472
<i>A disaster that happened</i>
<i>a long time ago.</i>

176
00:12:43.639 --> 00:12:47.684
<i>The video of a hero</i>
<i>that debuted right after that.</i>

177
00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:52.189
<i>Can you see that?</i>
<i>He's already saved a hundred people!</i>

178
00:12:52.356 --> 00:12:55.400
<i>That's crazy!</i>
<i>It hasn't even been ten minutes!</i>

179
00:12:55.567 --> 00:12:56.902
<i>That's crazy!</i>

180
00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:08.080
<i>He's laughing!</i>

181
00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:17.422
<i>It's fine now. Why?</i>

182
00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:23.637
<i>Because I am here.</i>

183
00:13:31.061 --> 00:13:32.855
He's so cool!

184
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.109
Once I get my Quirk.
I wanna be like him. too!

185
00:13:43.073 --> 00:13:44.491
You should probably give it up.

186
00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:52.082
That's… Is something wrong with him
after all?

187
00:13:52.249 --> 00:13:54.710
Most of the other kindergarteners' Quirks
have already manifested…

188
00:13:54.877 --> 00:13:56.837
He's the only one…

189
00:13:57.004 --> 00:14:00.382
Excuse me. but you're
fourth generation. right. ma'am?

190
00:14:00.549 --> 00:14:01.717
May I ask about your Quirk?

191
00:14:02.134 --> 00:14:03.635
Yes. of course.

192
00:14:03.802 --> 00:14:06.847
I can pull small objects to me.

193
00:14:07.014 --> 00:14:08.974
My husband can breathe fire.

194
00:14:09.141 --> 00:14:11.393
Normally. by age four.

195
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.396
he would have manifested
one of those Quirks.

196
00:14:14.563 --> 00:14:16.231
or some combination of the two.

197
00:14:17.149 --> 00:14:19.610
In the past. when the superpowers
first started showing up.

198
00:14:19.776 --> 00:14:22.154
the results of an early
research study were published.

199
00:14:22.321 --> 00:14:24.031
It became common practice

200
00:14:24.198 --> 00:14:26.241
to see if the pinky toe
was missing a joint or not.

201
00:14:27.034 --> 00:14:30.329
When parts of the body aren't used.
they're deemed unnecessary.

202
00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:33.999
People who didn't have the joint
were thought to be a newly evolved form.

203
00:14:35.167 --> 00:14:37.294
You can see by looking at this x-ray

204
00:14:37.461 --> 00:14:40.464
that Izuku has two joints.

205
00:14:42.132 --> 00:14:43.967
It's unusual to see that these days.

206
00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:47.137
but that means he has no Quirk.

207
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.521
<i>Can you see that?</i>

208
00:14:55.687 --> 00:14:57.898
<i>He's already saved</i>
<i>a hundred people!</i>

209
00:14:58.065 --> 00:15:00.692
<i>That's crazy!</i>
<i>It hasn't even been ten minutes!</i>

210
00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:01.860
<i>That's crazy!</i>

211
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.947
<i>He's laughing!</i>

212
00:15:05.781 --> 00:15:08.659
<i>It's fine now. Why?</i>

213
00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:10.577
<i>Because I am here.</i>

214
00:15:12.496 --> 00:15:13.747
Mom…

215
00:15:15.624 --> 00:15:19.837
He saves everyone with a smile.
no matter what trouble they're in.

216
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.383
He's such a cool hero.

217
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.229
Can I… be a hero. too?

218
00:15:42.985 --> 00:15:44.736
I'm sorry. Izuku!

219
00:15:44.903 --> 00:15:46.613
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

220
00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:54.204
<i>No. that's not it.</i>
<i>That's not it. Mom.</i>

221
00:15:55.831 --> 00:15:59.168
<i>What I wanted you to say</i>
<i>back then was…</i>

222
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.923
WATCH YOUR HEAD

223
00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:08.468
<i>You decided back then. didn't you?</i>

224
00:16:09.344 --> 00:16:12.639
<i>That's right. Don't worry</i>
<i>about what other people think!</i>

225
00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:15.809
<i>Hold your head up high</i>
<i>and plunge forward!</i>

226
00:16:29.948 --> 00:16:31.575
A villain?

227
00:16:32.743 --> 00:16:35.704
A medium-sized invisibility cloak…

228
00:16:42.586 --> 00:16:45.756
Don't worry. I'm just going
to take over your body.

229
00:16:45.923 --> 00:16:47.299
Calm down.

230
00:16:47.466 --> 00:16:50.135
It'll only hurt for about 45 seconds.

231
00:16:50.302 --> 00:16:52.429
You'll feel better soon.

232
00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:56.433
I can't… breathe…

233
00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:00.312
You can't grab me. I'm fluid!

234
00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:04.483
Thanks for your help.
You're my hero.

235
00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:09.905
I didn't think
that had come to this city.

236
00:17:11.573 --> 00:17:12.532
<i>My body…</i>

237
00:17:12.699 --> 00:17:14.867
<i>There's no strength…</i>

238
00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:20.540
<i>I'm dying… Am I dying?</i>

239
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.087
<i>I'm dying…</i>

240
00:17:25.671 --> 00:17:26.672
<i>Somebody…</i>

241
00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:29.132
<i>Somebody!</i>

242
00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:31.385
<i>No!</i>

243
00:17:37.099 --> 00:17:39.643
It's all right now. young man.

244
00:17:45.899 --> 00:17:47.901
I am here!

245
00:17:58.036 --> 00:18:01.832
Texas Smash!

246
00:18:09.715 --> 00:18:11.175
Wind pressure?

247
00:18:29.026 --> 00:18:33.447
<i>All… Might…</i>

248
00:18:36.867 --> 00:18:37.743
Hey!

249
00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:39.119
Hey!

250
00:18:40.662 --> 00:18:42.289
Oh. good!

251
00:18:46.293 --> 00:18:47.961
I'm glad you're okay!

252
00:18:48.462 --> 00:18:53.091
Sorry 'bout getting you caught up
in my villain fighting.

253
00:18:53.258 --> 00:18:55.928
I don't usually make mistakes like this.

254
00:18:56.094 --> 00:18:59.681
but I was in high spirits
on my day off in a new place.

255
00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:06.188
But. you were a big help. Thanks!

256
00:19:07.022 --> 00:19:08.440
I captured him safely!

257
00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:15.113
<i>The number one hero… All Might…</i>

258
00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.574
<i>He's the real thing!</i>

259
00:19:17.741 --> 00:19:22.204
<i>He looks</i>
<i>completely different in person!</i>

260
00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:27.501
Oh. right!
An autograph! Where should I…

261
00:19:27.918 --> 00:19:29.586
In that notebook.

262
00:19:30.045 --> 00:19:31.588
He already did!

263
00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:34.591
Thank you very much!

264
00:19:34.758 --> 00:19:37.427
It'll be an heirloom!
A family treasure!

265
00:19:37.594 --> 00:19:38.512
Okay!

266
00:19:39.221 --> 00:19:42.266
Well. I need to take this guy
to the police.

267
00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:45.394
See you again
on the other side of the screen!

268
00:19:46.645 --> 00:19:48.522
Wait. already?

269
00:19:48.689 --> 00:19:51.900
Pros are constantly fighting
enemies and time.

270
00:19:53.569 --> 00:19:54.653
<i>Wait…</i>

271
00:19:55.112 --> 00:19:58.282
<i>There are still… things I want to ask…</i>

272
00:19:59.658 --> 00:20:01.535
Well then.

273
00:20:02.786 --> 00:20:06.415
I'm counting on your continued support!

274
00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:09.084
Wait.

275
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:12.421
Hey!

276
00:20:12.921 --> 00:20:15.340
Let go of me!
Your fanaticism is too much!

277
00:20:15.507 --> 00:20:19.052
If I… let go now…
I'll die!

278
00:20:19.928 --> 00:20:20.846
That's true.

279
00:20:21.013 --> 00:20:24.183
I… have… a lot of things…

280
00:20:24.349 --> 00:20:27.144
I want to ask you directly!

281
00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:32.399
Okay! I get it.
so close your eyes and mouth!

282
00:20:44.328 --> 00:20:45.495
<i>Shit.</i>

283
00:20:58.091 --> 00:21:00.219
<i>That was scary…</i>

284
00:21:00.677 --> 00:21:05.057
Good grief. If you talk to the people
downstairs. I'm sure they'll let you down.

285
00:21:05.224 --> 00:21:08.602
I seriously am outta time.
so I really must go.

286
00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:10.562
Wait! Um…

287
00:21:10.729 --> 00:21:13.440
-No! I will not wait!
-But…

288
00:21:13.607 --> 00:21:15.442
You should probably give it up.

289
00:21:18.862 --> 00:21:20.572
<i>I'm sorry. Izuku!</i>

290
00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:23.283
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry!</i>

291
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.702
<i>What the hell can you do?</i>

292
00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:28.205
<i>You're Quirkless!</i>

293
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:37.422
<i>That might be true.</i>

294
00:21:39.174 --> 00:21:43.679
<i>But even so. I…</i>

295
00:21:51.854 --> 00:21:54.648
Even if I don't have a Quirk.
can I become a hero?

296
00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.112
Can even someone without a Quirk

297
00:22:00.821 --> 00:22:02.865
be like you?

298
00:22:15.043 --> 00:22:18.422
<i>My meeting with All Might.</i>
<i>this miracle.</i>

299
00:22:19.131 --> 00:22:22.551
<i>At the time.</i>
<i>I couldn't even imagine</i>

300
00:22:23.427 --> 00:22:27.514
<i>how much it would change my fate.</i>

301
00:24:01.066 --> 00:24:02.067
NEXT TIME

302
00:24:02.234 --> 00:24:04.069
<i>I am here</i>

303
00:24:04.236 --> 00:24:05.737
<i>for the next episode preview!</i>

304
00:24:06.154 --> 00:24:09.283
<i>What? The villain I caught escaped?</i>

305
00:24:09.449 --> 00:24:12.452
<i>It took a boy hostage</i>
<i>and is going wild around town?</i>

306
00:24:12.619 --> 00:24:15.831
<i>But I can't use my powers for much longer.</i>

307
00:24:16.999 --> 00:24:19.334
<i>You're pathetic. All Might!</i>

308
00:24:19.501 --> 00:24:21.587
<i>Is there another hero around?</i>

309
00:24:22.421 --> 00:24:24.590
<i>Next time.</i>
<i>"What It Takes to Be a Hero"!</i>

310
00:24:24.756 --> 00:24:26.925
<i>Pros are always risking their lives!</i>

311
00:24:27.092 --> 00:24:28.510
<i>Go beyond!</i>

312
00:24:28.677 --> 00:24:30.429
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
