00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:35.888
Hey. you!

2
00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:38.640
How are All Might's classes?

3
00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:42.644
Uh. excuse me.
I have to go to the nurse's office!

4
00:01:43.187 --> 00:01:44.479
Will you tell us about

5
00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:46.190
what the Symbol of Peace is like
as a teacher?

6
00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:48.275
What he's like?

7
00:01:48.442 --> 00:01:49.735
Um…

8
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.154
He's very muscular!

9
00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:54.990
What do you think of All Might
as a teacher?

10
00:01:55.157 --> 00:01:58.535
He made me recognize anew
that I attend an educational institution

11
00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:00.329
that is the best of the best.

12
00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.748
Of course. his dignity and character
go without saying.

13
00:02:02.915 --> 00:02:04.875
but we students are constantly
able to see his humorous side.

14
00:02:05.042 --> 00:02:07.836
It is a unique opportunity

15
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:12.591
to learn about being a top hero
directly from one.

16
00:02:12.758 --> 00:02:15.302
Excuse me!
Can you tell me about All Mi…

17
00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.514
Oh? You're the one who was
caught by the sludge villain…

18
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.556
Stop it!

19
00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:22.684
Um. about All Might…

20
00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:25.479
Wow. you're scruffy…
What's your deal?

21
00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:27.564
He's not on duty today.

22
00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:30.776
You are disturbing the classes.
Please leave.

23
00:02:31.443 --> 00:02:34.404
I would like to speak directly
with All Might…

24
00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:36.782
I feel like I've seen him before…

25
00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:38.909
Don't you think you're too scruffy?

26
00:02:39.076 --> 00:02:42.788
<i>I can't believe All Might was able</i>
<i>to work as a hero with all this.</i>

27
00:02:43.747 --> 00:02:45.958
Hey! Just a little time is fine!

28
00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:48.043
-Just let me see All Might…
-Ah. idiot!

29
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.672
What the…

30
00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.092
It's the U.A. Barrier.

31
00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:57.052
-That's what we call it.
-That's so lame!

32
00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:58.095
What the heck is that?

33
00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:02.683
If someone tries to get in without
a student ID or a pass to enter.

34
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.060
the security system kicks in.

35
00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.355
Apparently. there are sensors
all over the school.

36
00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:09.565
What the heck?

37
00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:11.692
They think they're so high and mighty.

38
00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.944
They could at least
give a brief comment.

39
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:16.822
Seriously.
we've been here for two days.

40
00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.073
and they still won't say anything.

41
00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:25.956
<i>The news that All Might had been hired</i>
<i>as a teacher at U.A. surprised the nation.</i>

42
00:03:26.123 --> 00:03:29.251
<i>and the media descended on the school</i>
<i>and caused a commotion for days.</i>

43
00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:33.755
<i>Everyone knew about it.</i>

44
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.801
<i>Yeah. everyone.</i>

45
00:03:39.428 --> 00:03:43.265
EPISODE NINE:
YEAH. JUST DO YOUR BEST. IIDA!

46
00:03:43.974 --> 00:03:46.518
Good work
on yesterday's combat training.

47
00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:49.688
I saw the video and results.

48
00:03:50.314 --> 00:03:56.278
Bakugo. you're talented.
so don't act like a kid.

49
00:03:57.279 --> 00:03:58.614
I know.

50
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.282
And Midoriya.

51
00:04:01.283 --> 00:04:03.994
You settled it
by breaking your arm again. huh?

52
00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:09.041
You can't keep saying
you can't help it

53
00:04:09.208 --> 00:04:11.835
because you can't control your Quirk.

54
00:04:12.628 --> 00:04:15.756
I don't like saying the same thing
over and over.

55
00:04:15.923 --> 00:04:18.716
As long as you fix the control issue.
there's a lot you'll be able to do.

56
00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:22.262
Feel a sense of urgency. Midoriya.

57
00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:23.347
Yes. sir!

58
00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:26.391
Now let's get down
to homeroom business.

59
00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:28.852
Sorry about the late notice.
but today. I'll have you…

60
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.605
<i>…take another special test?</i>

61
00:04:32.231 --> 00:04:33.982
…decide on a class representative.

62
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.610
<i>It's actually a normal school activity!</i>

63
00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:38.862
I want to be class rep! Pick me!

64
00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:40.989
-Me too!
-I want to do it. too.

65
00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:42.366
It's a job made for m…

66
00:04:42.533 --> 00:04:43.867
I'll be the leader!

67
00:04:44.368 --> 00:04:46.995
<i>In a normal class. students might feel</i>
<i>like they're just taking on daily duties.</i>

68
00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:48.121
<i>and this wouldn't happen.</i>

69
00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:50.207
<i>-But here in the hero course…</i>
-Let me do it! Me!

70
00:04:50.374 --> 00:04:55.629
<i>…it's a role that allows one to practice</i>
<i>being a top hero by leading a group.</i>

71
00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:57.047
Silence. please!

72
00:04:58.674 --> 00:05:01.885
It is a job with the serious
responsibility of leading others.

73
00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:04.179
It is not a job for just anyone
who wants to do it.

74
00:05:04.555 --> 00:05:07.224
It is a calling that requires
the trust of those around you.

75
00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:10.936
If we want to use democracy
to decide on a true leader.

76
00:05:11.687 --> 00:05:13.814
then we should hold an election
to choose one.

77
00:05:14.857 --> 00:05:16.817
Your hand is raised the highest!

78
00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:18.610
Why did you suggest that?

79
00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:20.612
We haven't known each other
for that long.

80
00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:22.406
so how can we have trust
or anything?

81
00:05:22.573 --> 00:05:24.283
If that's the case.
and everyone votes for themselves…

82
00:05:24.908 --> 00:05:28.036
Don't you think that is precisely why
whoever receives multiple votes here

83
00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:30.414
can be truly considered
the most suitable person?

84
00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:32.666
What do you think. Mr. Aizawa?

85
00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:35.544
I don't care. as long as you
decide before homeroom is over.

86
00:05:36.128 --> 00:05:37.462
Thank you very much!

87
00:05:40.966 --> 00:05:42.384
ELECTION RESULTS

88
00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:46.722
IZUKU MIDORIYA - THREE
MOMO YAOYOROZU - TWO

89
00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:47.973
I got three votes?

90
00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:50.726
Why Deku? Who voted for him?

91
00:05:50.893 --> 00:05:53.103
Well. it's better than voting for you.

92
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.771
What did you say?

93
00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:57.191
<i>It'll be scary if Bakugo finds out…</i>

94
00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:59.318
I give up! I give up!

95
00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:00.360
Zero votes…

96
00:06:00.944 --> 00:06:02.446
I knew that would happen…

97
00:06:02.613 --> 00:06:04.948
That is only to be expected
of a person's calling.

98
00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:07.159
You voted for someone else. huh?

99
00:06:07.326 --> 00:06:09.494
But you wanted to do it. too.

100
00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:12.414
What are you trying to do. Iida?

101
00:06:13.457 --> 00:06:15.334
Then. the class rep is Midoriya.

102
00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:17.753
and the deputy class rep
will be Yaoyorozu.

103
00:06:18.462 --> 00:06:21.173
Seriously?

104
00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:23.258
How vexing…

105
00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:25.219
That might not be too bad.

106
00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.513
After all's said and done.
Midoriya can be pretty fired up. anyway.

107
00:06:28.138 --> 00:06:31.934
And Yaoyorozu was cool when we were
going over the battle results!

108
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.436
LUNCH RUSH'S EATERY

109
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.772
There are a lot of people today. too!

110
00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:39.900
That's because everyone in the hero.
support. and management course

111
00:06:40.067 --> 00:06:41.944
meets in the same place.

112
00:06:46.657 --> 00:06:47.950
The rice is so delicious!

113
00:06:49.785 --> 00:06:52.204
Even though I've been chosen as class rep.

114
00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:53.705
I don't know if I'm qualified for it.

115
00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:54.957
You are.

116
00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:56.333
It'll be fine.

117
00:06:57.918 --> 00:07:01.421
Your courage and judgment
at critical moments

118
00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:03.841
make you worth following.

119
00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:05.634
That is why I voted for you.

120
00:07:05.801 --> 00:07:07.010
It was you?

121
00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:10.556
But didn't you want
to be class rep. too. Iida?

122
00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:11.765
I mean. you've got glasses
and everything.

123
00:07:11.932 --> 00:07:14.226
<i>Uraraka just talks without thinking…</i>

124
00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:18.522
Wanting to do it and being suitable for it
are different issues.

125
00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:21.400
I merely did
what I judged to be correct.

126
00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:22.693
"Merely"?

127
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.695
You don't usually use that word…

128
00:07:24.862 --> 00:07:26.196
Oh. that's…

129
00:07:26.989 --> 00:07:28.657
I've been thinking…

130
00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.743
Are you a rich boy. Iida?

131
00:07:32.077 --> 00:07:33.287
Rich…

132
00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:37.499
I tried to change how I talk
because I didn't want to be called that.

133
00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:46.133
<i>Yes. my family</i>
<i>have been heroes for generations.</i>

134
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.676
<i>I'm the second son.</i>

135
00:07:47.843 --> 00:07:50.220
<i>What? Wow!</i>

136
00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:52.723
Do you know
the Turbo Hero. Ingenium?

137
00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:53.974
Of course!

138
00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.393
He's a really popular hero

139
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.938
who has 65 sidekicks
working at his Tokyo agency!

140
00:08:00.522 --> 00:08:01.440
Don't tell me…

141
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.442
He is my elder brother!

142
00:08:03.609 --> 00:08:05.611
-He's telling us straight out!
-That's amazing!

143
00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:10.991
<i>He is a likable hero</i>
<i>who honors the rules and leads people.</i>

144
00:08:11.575 --> 00:08:15.746
I set my sights on being a hero
because I want to be like my brother.

145
00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:21.168
However. I think it is still too soon
for me to lead others.

146
00:08:21.335 --> 00:08:23.086
Unlike me. Midoriya realized

147
00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:25.797
the point of the practical portion
of the entrance exam.

148
00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:28.258
so he is more suitable for the job.

149
00:08:30.761 --> 00:08:33.597
This might be the first time
I've seen you smile. Iida.

150
00:08:33.764 --> 00:08:36.642
What. really? I smile!

151
00:08:37.601 --> 00:08:41.688
<i>Ingenium is to Iida</i>
<i>what All Might is to me.</i>

152
00:08:43.357 --> 00:08:45.609
<i>But. I should tell him…</i>

153
00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:48.070
About the entrance exam…

154
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.156
An alarm?

155
00:08:51.323 --> 00:08:52.991
<i>There has been</i>
<i>a level three security breach.</i>

156
00:08:53.158 --> 00:08:54.034
What?

157
00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:56.703
<i>All students please</i>
<i>evacuate outdoors promptly.</i>

158
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.122
-What's "level three security"?
-<i>I repeat…</i>

159
00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:01.875
It means someone is trespassing
on school grounds!

160
00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.877
I've never seen anything like this
in the three years I've been here!

161
00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:05.254
You should hurry. too!

162
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.756
LUNCH RUSH'S EATERY

163
00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:10.551
Don't push!

164
00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:12.135
Wait. I'm falling!

165
00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:14.721
-I said. don't push!
-Ow…

166
00:09:15.264 --> 00:09:16.515
What's going on all of a sudden?

167
00:09:16.682 --> 00:09:18.100
As expected of the best of the best.

168
00:09:18.267 --> 00:09:19.768
Everyone reacts quickly in a crisis!

169
00:09:20.686 --> 00:09:22.729
They're so quick
that it's causing a panic!

170
00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:24.273
Oh. shoot!

171
00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:26.108
-Midoriya!
-Deku!

172
00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:29.778
Who in the world trespassed?

173
00:09:30.362 --> 00:09:31.405
That's…

174
00:09:31.572 --> 00:09:33.156
the press!

175
00:09:33.532 --> 00:09:35.075
Give us All Might!

176
00:09:35.242 --> 00:09:36.326
He's here. isn't he?

177
00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:37.744
We told you. he's not here!

178
00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:40.247
If you just give us
one brief comment. we'll leave!

179
00:09:40.414 --> 00:09:43.166
If you guys get one comment. you'll want
another. That's just how you are.

180
00:09:43.876 --> 00:09:45.377
They're illegal trespassers. you know.

181
00:09:45.544 --> 00:09:47.045
You could call them villains.

182
00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:48.547
You think we can beat 'em up?

183
00:09:48.714 --> 00:09:52.009
Don't do it. Mic. They'll write up
a bunch of half-truths about you.

184
00:09:52.176 --> 00:09:54.178
Let's wait for the police.

185
00:09:54.595 --> 00:09:57.181
I wondered what it was.
but it's just the media.

186
00:09:57.347 --> 00:09:58.849
Everyone. calm dow…

187
00:09:59.016 --> 00:09:59.933
-Ouch!
-Ow!

188
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.059
Wait. someone fell!

189
00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:02.477
Don't push!

190
00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:03.896
<i>Where are the teachers?</i>

191
00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:05.772
<i>Are they busy</i>
<i>trying to deal with everything?</i>

192
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:09.359
-Everyone. stop! Slow down!
<i>-Kirishima! Kaminari!</i>

193
00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:10.861
What the heck?

194
00:10:12.404 --> 00:10:15.199
<i>Is there anyone here</i>
<i>who knows everything's fine?</i>

195
00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:17.868
<i>No one has noticed!</i>
<i>Everyone's panicking!</i>

196
00:10:19.453 --> 00:10:20.746
Uraraka!

197
00:10:20.913 --> 00:10:22.331
Iida!

198
00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:29.421
<i>What would Midoriya… or my brother…</i>
<i>do in this situation?</i>

199
00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:33.050
Uraraka!

200
00:10:36.428 --> 00:10:37.721
Make me…

201
00:10:38.222 --> 00:10:39.681
Make me float. Uraraka!

202
00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:52.236
<i>A place in everyone's line of sight…</i>

203
00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:56.740
Engine boost!

204
00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:02.829
Iida!

205
00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:10.629
<i>Be concise. clear. and bold!</i>

206
00:11:10.796 --> 00:11:11.880
BOOM

207
00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:13.757
Everyone. everything's fine!

208
00:11:16.218 --> 00:11:17.719
It is just the media!

209
00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:21.348
There is nothing to panic about.
Everything's fine!

210
00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:23.016
This is U.A.

211
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.770
Let us act in a way
befitting the best of the best.

212
00:11:31.692 --> 00:11:32.776
The police are here.

213
00:11:32.943 --> 00:11:34.236
Oh. good.

214
00:11:37.114 --> 00:11:40.325
Goodbye. bad mass media!

215
00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:46.331
Come on. class rep. Start.

216
00:11:47.124 --> 00:11:51.295
Now. let us decide
on the other class officers…

217
00:11:52.296 --> 00:11:55.090
But first. can I say something?

218
00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:00.554
I think… that Tenya Iida
should be the class rep after all!

219
00:12:02.806 --> 00:12:05.934
He was able to get everyone's
attention in such a cool way.

220
00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:09.813
I think it would be best
for Iida to do it.

221
00:12:12.149 --> 00:12:14.109
I'm good with that. too.

222
00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:16.695
Midoriya's saying it.

223
00:12:16.862 --> 00:12:19.573
and it's true that Iida was a big help
at the cafeteria today.

224
00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:22.826
Yeah. and he kind of looked
like the person

225
00:12:22.993 --> 00:12:25.162
on the emergency exit signs. didn't he?

226
00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:26.663
You're wasting time.

227
00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:30.667
I don't care what you do.
just hurry up and do it.

228
00:12:34.171 --> 00:12:37.633
If the class rep has nominated me.
then it cannot be helped.

229
00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:39.676
From this day forth. I. Tenya Iida.

230
00:12:39.843 --> 00:12:42.971
promise to do my best to carry out
the duties of class representative.

231
00:12:43.138 --> 00:12:44.723
We're counting on you.
Emergency Exit!

232
00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:46.725
Emergency Exit Iida!

233
00:12:47.226 --> 00:12:48.560
Do your best!

234
00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:50.479
What about me?

235
00:12:57.694 --> 00:13:02.908
How were the ordinary members of the press
able to do something like this?

236
00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:06.203
Someone instigated this.

237
00:13:06.787 --> 00:13:09.456
Did someone evil slip in.

238
00:13:09.623 --> 00:13:13.001
or was it intended
to be a declaration of war?

239
00:13:28.559 --> 00:13:31.895
Listen heroes.
don't come after me.

240
00:13:32.062 --> 00:13:35.649
If you do.
I'm gonna kill this rich family here.

241
00:13:36.525 --> 00:13:38.151
It's fine now. family!

242
00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:42.322
Missouri Smash!

243
00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:50.247
Why? Because I am here
on my way to work.

244
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.083
A hit-and-run!

245
00:13:53.709 --> 00:13:57.045
It'll be bad if I'm late. but…

246
00:14:00.382 --> 00:14:01.717
<i>I've gotten slower?</i>

247
00:14:02.926 --> 00:14:06.180
<i>After I gave young Midoriya</i>
<i>One For All.</i>

248
00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:09.183
<i>my powers have been weakening.</i>

249
00:14:10.893 --> 00:14:13.520
<i>On top of that.</i>
<i>after forcing myself that time.</i>

250
00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:16.356
<i>the time I can spend in that form</i>
<i>has gotten shorter than before.</i>

251
00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:21.862
<i>You told young Bakugo?</i>

252
00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.700
I'm sorry.

253
00:14:28.327 --> 00:14:30.454
I didn't even tell my mom.

254
00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:34.124
but for some reason.
I felt like I just had to tell him.

255
00:14:34.291 --> 00:14:36.126
I'm really sorry.

256
00:14:36.877 --> 00:14:39.254
<i>I judged that he was not</i>
<i>the type to show off.</i>

257
00:14:39.421 --> 00:14:41.507
<i>so I did not admonish him strongly.</i>

258
00:14:41.673 --> 00:14:44.343
<i>but this seems to be the result</i>
<i>of his sincerity backfiring.</i>

259
00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:49.431
Fortunately. young Bakugo
did not seem to take it seriously.

260
00:14:49.973 --> 00:14:51.850
so I'll let it go this time.

261
00:14:53.143 --> 00:14:54.978
But please don't do it again.

262
00:14:55.479 --> 00:14:58.524
Please think carefully about
what it means to have this power.

263
00:14:59.441 --> 00:15:00.442
If word gets out.

264
00:15:00.609 --> 00:15:02.361
it's clear that the world would be teeming

265
00:15:02.528 --> 00:15:04.530
with those trying to steal
the power from you.

266
00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.158
This secret should be kept
both to prevent chaos in society

267
00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:10.494
and for your sake.

268
00:15:12.162 --> 00:15:13.580
Do you understand?

269
00:15:15.624 --> 00:15:19.294
<i>Even if he is a suitable vessel.</i>
<i>he is still only a 15-year-old boy.</i>

270
00:15:20.087 --> 00:15:22.339
<i>I have to pull myself together.</i>

271
00:15:22.506 --> 00:15:25.175
Someone's barricaded themselves in
in the neighboring town!

272
00:15:28.554 --> 00:15:30.681
For today's hero basic training.

273
00:15:31.265 --> 00:15:34.101
it's turned into a class
with three instructors.

274
00:15:34.268 --> 00:15:36.270
All Might and me.
and one more person.

275
00:15:37.563 --> 00:15:38.647
<i>"Turned into"?</i>

276
00:15:38.814 --> 00:15:40.065
<i>I wonder if it's a special case?</i>

277
00:15:40.232 --> 00:15:42.150
Excuse me! What'll we be doing?

278
00:15:43.569 --> 00:15:46.029
Disasters. shipwrecks.
and everything in between.

279
00:15:46.196 --> 00:15:47.281
It's rescue training.

280
00:15:47.823 --> 00:15:50.617
Rescue… Looks like
it'll be a lot of work this time. too.

281
00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:51.660
Right?

282
00:15:51.827 --> 00:15:54.913
Idiot. this is the duty of a hero!

283
00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:57.165
My arms are ready to rumble!

284
00:15:57.332 --> 00:16:00.127
No one can beat me in water. ribbit.

285
00:16:00.544 --> 00:16:01.753
Hey. I'm not done.

286
00:16:03.255 --> 00:16:08.010
You can decide if you want
to wear your costume or not this time.

287
00:16:08.552 --> 00:16:12.890
Because there are probably costumes
that limit your abilities. too.

288
00:16:13.557 --> 00:16:17.728
The training will take place
off-campus. so we're taking a bus.

289
00:16:17.895 --> 00:16:19.855
That is all. Start getting ready.

290
00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:21.982
<i>Rescue training…</i>

291
00:16:22.774 --> 00:16:23.984
<i>What I've admired…</i>

292
00:16:25.277 --> 00:16:28.780
<i>It's training to get another step</i>
<i>closer to being the greatest hero.</i>

293
00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:30.616
I'll do my best!

294
00:16:32.284 --> 00:16:36.455
Oh. you're wearing your P.E. clothes.
Where's your costume?

295
00:16:36.622 --> 00:16:39.541
It got ripped up
during the combat training.

296
00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:41.835
so I'm waiting for
the support company to fix it.

297
00:16:43.921 --> 00:16:45.464
Class 1-A. gather round!

298
00:16:45.631 --> 00:16:47.925
Form two lines by your student numbers

299
00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:50.177
in order to make boarding the bus
go smoothly!

300
00:16:51.136 --> 00:16:53.764
Iida's going at full throttle…

301
00:16:56.642 --> 00:16:59.061
Shoot.
I didn't think it'd be this type of bus.

302
00:16:59.228 --> 00:17:00.604
There was no point. huh?

303
00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:03.607
I say whatever comes to mind.

304
00:17:04.398 --> 00:17:05.317
Midoriya…

305
00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:07.236
Um. yes. Asui?

306
00:17:07.402 --> 00:17:09.029
Call me "Tsu."

307
00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:10.321
Right…

308
00:17:11.198 --> 00:17:14.076
Your Quirk is like All Might's.

309
00:17:14.242 --> 00:17:17.079
Huh? You think so?

310
00:17:17.246 --> 00:17:19.414
But I'm… uh…

311
00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:22.917
Wait a sec. Tsu. All Might
doesn't get hurt when he uses his.

312
00:17:23.085 --> 00:17:24.837
They just kind of look the same.

313
00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.424
But it's nice to have
a simple augmenting-type Quirk.

314
00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:31.593
You can do lots of flashy stuff!

315
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.304
My Hardening's strong against others.

316
00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:36.557
but unfortunately.
it doesn't look like much.

317
00:17:36.723 --> 00:17:38.976
I think it's really cool!

318
00:17:39.142 --> 00:17:41.770
It's a Quirk that can definitely
pass as a pro's!

319
00:17:41.937 --> 00:17:42.896
A pro's. huh?

320
00:17:43.063 --> 00:17:46.108
But you have to think about popularity
as a hero. too. you know.

321
00:17:46.608 --> 00:17:49.862
My Navel Laser is pro-level
in both flashiness and strength.

322
00:17:50.028 --> 00:17:52.906
But it's not great
that it gives you a stomachache.

323
00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:55.367
Well. if you're talking about
flashy and strong.

324
00:17:55.826 --> 00:17:57.995
it's gotta be Todoroki and Bakugo.
though. huh?

325
00:17:59.621 --> 00:18:03.166
Bakugo's always mad. so he doesn't seem
like he'll be popular. though.

326
00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.086
-What the hell! You wanna fight?
-See?

327
00:18:06.461 --> 00:18:08.547
We haven't known each other that long.

328
00:18:08.714 --> 00:18:11.175
so it's amazing that everyone
already knows his personality

329
00:18:11.341 --> 00:18:12.885
is crap steeped in sewage.

330
00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.888
What's with that vocabulary. bastard?
I'll kill you!

331
00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:18.348
<i>Kacchan's being teased…</i>

332
00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:20.642
<i>I can't believe what I'm seeing!</i>

333
00:18:20.809 --> 00:18:22.227
<i>That's U.A. for you!</i>

334
00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:25.022
What a vulgar conversation.

335
00:18:25.189 --> 00:18:27.232
But I like stuff like this. too.

336
00:18:28.108 --> 00:18:30.652
We're here.
Stop messing around.

337
00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:32.112
Yes. sir!

338
00:18:35.449 --> 00:18:36.992
<i>Everyone.</i>
<i>I have been waiting for you.</i>

339
00:18:39.328 --> 00:18:41.496
It's the Space Hero. Thirteen!

340
00:18:41.663 --> 00:18:45.167
The gentlemanly hero who has rescued
tons of people from disasters!

341
00:18:45.334 --> 00:18:48.420
Oh. I love Thirteen!

342
00:18:49.254 --> 00:18:51.048
<i>Let's go inside without delay.</i>

343
00:18:51.215 --> 00:18:53.425
Look forward to working with you!

344
00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:01.725
Wow. it looks like
Universal Studios Japan!

345
00:19:03.268 --> 00:19:04.853
<i>A shipwreck.</i>

346
00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.021
<i>a landslide.</i>

347
00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:08.607
<i>a fire. a windstorm.</i>

348
00:19:09.191 --> 00:19:10.359
<i>et caetera…</i>

349
00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:13.403
<i>It is a training ground that I made</i>

350
00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:16.156
<i>with different types</i>
<i>of accidents and disasters.</i>

351
00:19:16.698 --> 00:19:20.118
It's called the
"Unforeseen Simulation Joint."

352
00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:22.412
<i>or "USJ" for short!</i>

353
00:19:23.205 --> 00:19:25.165
<i>It really is USJ…</i>

354
00:19:25.874 --> 00:19:28.335
Thirteen. where's All Might?

355
00:19:28.502 --> 00:19:30.879
He was supposed to meet us here.

356
00:19:31.046 --> 00:19:32.673
<i>About that…</i>

357
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.552
<i>It looks like he did too much hero work</i>
<i>on his way to work</i>

358
00:19:36.718 --> 00:19:38.095
<i>and ran out of time.</i>

359
00:19:38.262 --> 00:19:40.055
<i>so he's resting in the lounge.</i>

360
00:19:40.806 --> 00:19:45.352
Sorry… I should be able
to go for a little bit at the end.

361
00:19:45.519 --> 00:19:47.062
I'm really sorry!

362
00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.315
That's the height of irrationality.

363
00:19:51.066 --> 00:19:53.569
<i>Well. we took precautions just in case…</i>

364
00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:56.530
It can't be helped. Shall we begin?

365
00:19:57.072 --> 00:20:01.910
<i>Let's see… Before we begin. let me</i>
<i>say one thing. er. or two. or three…</i>

366
00:20:02.077 --> 00:20:04.413
-<i>Or four. five. six. seven…</i>
<i>-It's increasing!</i>

367
00:20:06.665 --> 00:20:10.919
<i>Everyone. I am sure you are aware</i>
<i>of my Quirk. Black Hole.</i>

368
00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:14.756
<i>I can suck up anything</i>
<i>and turn it to dust.</i>

369
00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:17.050
You've been able to use that Quirk

370
00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:19.344
to save people
from all kinds of disasters. right?

371
00:20:19.511 --> 00:20:23.182
<i>Yes. but it is a power</i>
<i>that can kill easily.</i>

372
00:20:25.142 --> 00:20:28.187
<i>Some of you also have</i>
<i>Quirks like that. right?</i>

373
00:20:29.313 --> 00:20:31.148
In a superhuman society.

374
00:20:31.315 --> 00:20:34.526
personal Quirks have been
certified and stringently regulated.

375
00:20:34.693 --> 00:20:36.737
so that doesn't seem to be
a problem at first glance.

376
00:20:37.613 --> 00:20:39.865
<i>However. please do not forget</i>

377
00:20:40.032 --> 00:20:44.995
<i>that there are many Quirks</i>
<i>that can easily kill with one wrong step.</i>

378
00:20:45.913 --> 00:20:47.497
<i>With Aizawa's physical fitness test.</i>

379
00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:50.751
<i>you found out about the possibility</i>
<i>of your own hidden powers.</i>

380
00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:53.629
<i>and with All Might's</i>
<i>person-to-person combat training.</i>

381
00:20:53.795 --> 00:20:57.633
<i>I think you experienced the danger</i>
<i>of using those powers against others.</i>

382
00:20:58.133 --> 00:21:00.135
<i>This class is a fresh start.</i>

383
00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:04.431
<i>You shall learn how to use your Quirks</i>
<i>to save people's lives.</i>

384
00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:09.144
<i>You do not have powers</i>
<i>so you can harm others.</i>

385
00:21:09.645 --> 00:21:11.730
<i>I hope you leave here</i>
<i>with the understanding</i>

386
00:21:11.897 --> 00:21:14.191
<i>that you have powers</i>
<i>in order to help others.</i>

387
00:21:14.358 --> 00:21:16.860
<i>Thirteen's so cool!</i>

388
00:21:17.736 --> 00:21:20.364
<i>That is all. Thank you for listening.</i>

389
00:21:20.531 --> 00:21:21.823
That was wonderful!

390
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:24.910
Bravo! Bravo!

391
00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.371
All right then. first…

392
00:21:51.395 --> 00:21:52.729
Gather together and don't move!

393
00:21:53.814 --> 00:21:55.482
Thirteen. protect the students!

394
00:21:57.109 --> 00:21:58.402
What's that?

395
00:22:02.948 --> 00:22:06.577
Is this like the entrance exam
where the lesson's already started?

396
00:22:06.743 --> 00:22:08.287
Don't move!

397
00:22:12.749 --> 00:22:14.293
Those are villains.

398
00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.132
<i>And coincidentally. during the time</i>

399
00:22:20.299 --> 00:22:23.218
<i>when we were supposed</i>
<i>to be practicing saving lives.</i>

400
00:22:23.927 --> 00:22:26.263
<i>they showed up in front of us.</i>

401
00:24:01.066 --> 00:24:01.984
NEXT TIME

402
00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.735
<i>Asui. the villains have attacked!</i>

403
00:24:03.902 --> 00:24:06.113
<i>-Call me "Tsu."</i>
<i>-Tsu…</i>

404
00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.740
<i>Next time.</i>
<i>"Encounter with the Unknown."</i>

405
00:24:08.907 --> 00:24:11.910
<i>I know why Mineta's hair</i>
<i>is like that now.</i>

406
00:24:12.077 --> 00:24:13.745
<i>Go beyond!</i>

407
00:24:13.912 --> 00:24:15.497
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
