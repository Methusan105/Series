1
00:00:02.753 --> 00:00:04.838
The cumulative results
for the practical exam are out!

2
00:00:05.464 --> 00:00:08.634
I can't believe he got first place
with no rescue points.

3
00:00:09.051 --> 00:00:12.054
<i>The faux villains acquire their targets</i>
<i>and draw near them.</i>

4
00:00:12.888 --> 00:00:14.473
<i>In the second half.</i>
<i>as others were slowing down.</i>

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.559
<i>he used his flashy Quirk to keep bringing</i>
<i>them close and then counterattacking.</i>

6
00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:19.728
<i>It's the result of his toughness.</i>

7
00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:24.566
<i>In contrast. there's the seventh place</i>
<i>student with zero villain points.</i>

8
00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:28.529
<i>There have been other examinees</i>
<i>who took on the large villain in the past.</i>

9
00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.615
<i>but it's been a while since I last saw</i>
<i>someone blow it away.</i>

10
00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:34.868
But to suffer such a serious
injury from his own attack…

11
00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:38.872
It's like he's a young child
whose Quirk just manifested.

12
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.055
<i>The night after I opened</i>
<i>my acceptance letter.</i>

13
00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.849
<i>that person contacted me.</i>

14
00:02:23.352 --> 00:02:24.561
All Might!

15
00:02:25.437 --> 00:02:26.813
-Who's that?
-All Might?

16
00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:28.565
No way! Where?

17
00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:31.568
Repeat after me.
"I had the wrong person."

18
00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:34.321
Oh. I had the wrong person!

19
00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:37.199
-Aw. what?
-I was hoping to see him…

20
00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.412
Congrats on getting accepted.

21
00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:45.082
Thank you very much!

22
00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:50.295
Just so you know. I didn't tell the school
about my connection to you.

23
00:02:51.088 --> 00:02:54.758
You're the type that would think
that's cheating. right?

24
00:02:54.925 --> 00:02:56.635
I wasn't one of the judges.

25
00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:58.971
Thank you for your concern!

26
00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.226
But I was surprised to find out
that you were a teacher at U.A.

27
00:03:04.393 --> 00:03:06.436
So that's why you came here. huh?

28
00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:09.147
I mean. your agency is in Roppongi
in Minato. Tokyo at…

29
00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:10.566
Stop that!

30
00:03:12.943 --> 00:03:17.239
I couldn't tell anyone
before the school announced it.

31
00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:20.576
I just happened to be offered
a job from U.A.

32
00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:22.327
when I was searching for a successor.

33
00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:25.914
I have been looking for a successor.

34
00:03:26.582 --> 00:03:31.503
<i>I see. He was originally planning</i>
<i>on choosing one of the students.</i>

35
00:03:31.962 --> 00:03:35.591
<i>One of the students gifted</i>
<i>with an amazing Quirk.</i>

36
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.764
My body broke with one kick
and one punch of One For All.

37
00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:45.434
I can't control it at all.

38
00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:47.436
That can't be helped.

39
00:03:47.603 --> 00:03:51.148
It's like if you asked a person
who suddenly grew a tail to do a trick.

40
00:03:51.315 --> 00:03:53.942
they wouldn't even be able to control it.

41
00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:58.614
Wait. did you know
that would happen?

42
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.742
Well. there wasn't any time…

43
00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:05.120
But it turned out all right.
It turned out "all might"!

44
00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:09.291
Right now. you're either
at a hundred percent or zero.

45
00:04:09.458 --> 00:04:11.919
But once you can control it.

46
00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:14.630
you'll be able to adjust
to what your body can handle.

47
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.048
Control?

48
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.177
<i>The more you train a vessel.</i>

49
00:04:20.344 --> 00:04:22.262
<i>the more you'll be able</i>
<i>to move the power freely.</i>

50
00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:25.390
Like this.

51
00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:30.187
Wait. is that All Might?

52
00:04:30.354 --> 00:04:32.189
No way! When did he get here?

53
00:04:32.648 --> 00:04:35.025
-Let's go. young Midoriya!
-Yes. sir!

54
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.616
<i>The flame I passed on to you</i>
<i>is still small.</i>

55
00:04:42.783 --> 00:04:47.955
<i>but in the future. it'll be exposed</i>
<i>to wind and rain and grow even bigger.</i>

56
00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:53.836
<i>And then. I will slowly become weak</i>
<i>and disappear. and I will finish my job.</i>

57
00:04:55.212 --> 00:04:56.964
<i>Yeah. that's deep.</i>

58
00:04:57.714 --> 00:05:01.552
EPISODE FOUR:
WHAT I CAN DO FOR NOW

59
00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:03.887
APRIL

60
00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:06.723
-Izuku. do you have tissues?
-Yeah.

61
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.434
And what about your handkerchief?
Your hanky?

62
00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:12.896
I have it! I'm going to be late.
I have to hurry.

63
00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:14.314
-Izuku!
-What is it?

64
00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:19.403
You're really cool.

65
00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:24.533
<i>That was the beginning</i>
<i>of my high school career.</i>

66
00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:28.954
I'm off!

67
00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:34.543
<i>The acceptance rate</i>
<i>for U.A. High's hero course</i>

68
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.087
<i>is less than one</i>
<i>in three hundred every year.</i>

69
00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.631
<i>Other than the four people</i>
<i>admitted through recommendations.</i>

70
00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:42.259
<i>Thirty-six are admitted</i>
<i>through the regular exam.</i>

71
00:05:42.885 --> 00:05:45.762
<i>Those 36 are split into</i>
<i>only two classes. with 18 in each.</i>

72
00:05:46.263 --> 00:05:49.766
Class 1-A…
This place's too big.

73
00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:51.768
There it is!

74
00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:55.939
The door's huge!
Is it for accessibility?

75
00:05:57.399 --> 00:06:00.319
The elite chosen
from the huge number at the exam…

76
00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:08.076
I hope I'm not in the same class
as the scary people…

77
00:06:08.577 --> 00:06:10.954
-Don't put your feet on the desk!
-Huh?

78
00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:13.790
Don't you think that's rude
to the U.A. upperclassmen

79
00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:16.043
and the people who made the desk?

80
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.172
Nope. What junior high did you go to.
you side character?

81
00:06:20.756 --> 00:06:21.757
<i>The top two?</i>

82
00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:26.970
I attended Somei Private Academy.
My name is Tenya Iida.

83
00:06:27.346 --> 00:06:30.349
Somei? So you're a damn elite. huh?

84
00:06:30.516 --> 00:06:32.809
Looks like I'll have fun crushing you.

85
00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:34.228
"Crushing"?

86
00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:37.147
That's cruel.
Do you truly aim to be a hero?

87
00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:41.735
You're…

88
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.030
Oh. um…

89
00:06:45.197 --> 00:06:46.365
Good morning!

90
00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:49.618
-I am from Somei. My name is--
-I heard!

91
00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:54.498
I'm Midoriya. Nice to meet you. Iida.

92
00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:58.877
Midoriya. you realized
there was something more

93
00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:01.213
to that practical exam. didn't you?

94
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.715
I had no idea…

95
00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:05.509
I misjudged you!

96
00:07:05.676 --> 00:07:08.720
I hate to admit it.
but you are better than me.

97
00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:11.431
<i>Sorry. I actually didn't realize anything.</i>

98
00:07:11.974 --> 00:07:15.686
Oh. that curly hair!
You're the plain-looking one!

99
00:07:15.853 --> 00:07:17.938
<i>-It's the nice person!</i>
-You passed. just like Present Mic said!

100
00:07:18.105 --> 00:07:19.606
<i>She looks good in a uniform…</i>

101
00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:21.525
Of course you did!
Your punch was amazing!

102
00:07:21.984 --> 00:07:25.279
Oh. well. um. it was
thanks to you going to speak

103
00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.364
with him directly that I. uh…

104
00:07:27.531 --> 00:07:30.033
-How did you know about that?
-Oh. uh. that's because…

105
00:07:31.243 --> 00:07:35.038
I can't believe we have two students
from our school matriculating into U.A.!

106
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:39.001
Especially you. Midoriya. It's a miracle!

107
00:07:42.713 --> 00:07:46.341
What dirty tricks
did you use to get in. huh?

108
00:07:46.717 --> 00:07:49.595
"The first student from his school
to go to U.A."

109
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:52.764
My future plan
has already been torn to pieces.

110
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.434
I told you to go somewhere else!

111
00:07:57.144 --> 00:07:58.437
Kacchan.

112
00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:02.441
Someone told me:

113
00:08:02.608 --> 00:08:05.027
"You can become a hero".

114
00:08:05.194 --> 00:08:07.487
That it was because of my own effort.

115
00:08:08.614 --> 00:08:09.948
That's why…

116
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.451
I'm going!

117
00:08:14.912 --> 00:08:17.080
<i>How dare he defy me?</i>

118
00:08:17.456 --> 00:08:19.458
<i>Something's definitely up.</i>

119
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:22.127
I wonder if today's just
the entrance ceremony and orientation?

120
00:08:22.294 --> 00:08:24.129
I wonder what our teacher's like?

121
00:08:24.296 --> 00:08:25.297
-Aren't you nervous?
-<i>So close!</i>

122
00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:28.550
Go somewhere else
if you want to play at being friends.

123
00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:36.892
This is the hero course.

124
00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:41.855
<i>Something's here?</i>

125
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:47.277
Okay. it took eight seconds
before you were quiet.

126
00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:50.989
Time is limited.
You kids are not rational enough.

127
00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:53.283
A teacher?

128
00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.161
Which means.
that person's a pro hero. too?

129
00:08:56.328 --> 00:08:59.373
But I've never seen a hero
who looked that worn out before.

130
00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:03.043
I'm your homeroom teacher.
Shota Aizawa.

131
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.294
Nice to meet you.

132
00:09:04.962 --> 00:09:06.296
Homeroom teacher?

133
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:10.300
It's kind of sudden. but put this on
and go out onto the field.

134
00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:13.595
TEACHER DIRECTORY

135
00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:17.266
<i>The U.A. system</i>
<i>does not follow the beaten path.</i>

136
00:09:19.268 --> 00:09:21.603
<i>Depending on the homeroom teacher.</i>
<i>even the first day can be…</i>

137
00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:25.482
A Quirk assessment test?

138
00:09:25.983 --> 00:09:27.985
What about the entrance ceremony?
The orientation?

139
00:09:28.527 --> 00:09:30.737
If you're going to become a hero.

140
00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:33.949
you don't have time
for such leisurely events.

141
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.995
U.A.'s selling point is how unrestricted
its school traditions are.

142
00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:40.831
That's also how the teachers
run their classes.

143
00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:46.170
You kids have been doing these
since junior high. too. right?

144
00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:49.673
Physical fitness tests where you
weren't allowed to use your Quirks.

145
00:09:50.507 --> 00:09:52.426
The country still uses averages

146
00:09:52.593 --> 00:09:55.179
taken from results from students
not using their Quirks.

147
00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:57.472
It's not rational.

148
00:09:57.639 --> 00:10:00.309
Well. the Ministry of Education
is procrastinating.

149
00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:04.104
Bakugo. you finished at the top
of the practical exam. right?

150
00:10:05.439 --> 00:10:09.443
In junior high. what was your best result
for the softball throw?

151
00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:11.320
Sixty-seven meters.

152
00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:13.864
Then. try doing it with your Quirk.

153
00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:17.075
You can do whatever you want
as long as you stay in the circle.

154
00:10:17.743 --> 00:10:19.453
Hurry up. Give it all you've got.

155
00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:22.831
Then. well…

156
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.711
<i>I'll add a blast to the pitch.</i>

157
00:10:29.171 --> 00:10:30.088
Die!

158
00:10:34.176 --> 00:10:35.219
"Die"?

159
00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:38.055
Know your own maximum first.

160
00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:45.562
That is the most rational way
to form the foundation of a hero.

161
00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:50.442
Seven hundred and five meters?
Seriously?

162
00:10:51.026 --> 00:10:52.528
What's this? It looks fun!

163
00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:55.781
We can use our Quirks as much as we want!
As expected from the hero course!

164
00:10:57.533 --> 00:10:59.201
"It looks fun." huh?

165
00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:02.829
You have three years to become a hero.

166
00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:06.041
Will you have an attitude
like that the whole time?

167
00:11:07.417 --> 00:11:08.585
All right.

168
00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:11.463
Whoever comes in last place
in all eight tests

169
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.632
will be judged to have no potential

170
00:11:13.799 --> 00:11:15.342
and will be punished with expulsion.

171
00:11:15.843 --> 00:11:17.135
Huh?

172
00:11:18.512 --> 00:11:19.972
Aizawa. huh?

173
00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:21.014
NAME: SHOTA AIZAWA
ERASURE HERO: ERASER HEAD

174
00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:23.433
He'll be facing a lot
of suffering from the start.

175
00:11:26.812 --> 00:11:28.313
<i>Punished with expulsion?</i>

176
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.483
<i>Oh no… This is bad!</i>
<i>In all eight tests?</i>

177
00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:36.530
<i>I can only use One For All at either</i>
<i>a hundred or zero percent.</i>

178
00:11:37.072 --> 00:11:39.157
<i>I can't control it yet…</i>

179
00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:42.661
We're free to do what we want
about the circumstances of our students.

180
00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:48.000
Welcome to U.A.'s hero course!

181
00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:51.461
<i>A huge test on the first day of school?</i>

182
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.215
<i>What am I going to do?</i>

183
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:06.685
Last place will be expelled?

184
00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:08.979
But it's the first day of school!

185
00:12:09.146 --> 00:12:11.899
No. even if it wasn't the first day
of school. this is too unfair!

186
00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:14.610
Natural disasters. big accidents.

187
00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:17.112
<i>and selfish villains.</i>

188
00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:20.782
<i>Calamities whose time or place</i>
<i>can't be predicted.</i>

189
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:23.368
<i>Japan is covered with unfairness.</i>

190
00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:27.039
Heroes are the ones
who reverse those situations.

191
00:12:27.915 --> 00:12:30.042
If you wanted to go talk
with your friends at Mickey D's

192
00:12:30.209 --> 00:12:31.251
after school. too bad.

193
00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:33.045
For the next three years.

194
00:12:33.212 --> 00:12:36.048
U.A. will do all it can to give you
one hardship after another.

195
00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:40.344
Go beyond. Plus Ultra.

196
00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:44.056
Overcome it with all you've got.

197
00:12:47.726 --> 00:12:49.645
<i>This is too serious to be hazing.</i>

198
00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:53.273
<i>However. this is the best of the best.</i>
<i>There is no choice but to do it.</i>

199
00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:55.651
<i>This isn't all I've got.</i>

200
00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:59.279
All right. demonstration's over.

201
00:13:00.072 --> 00:13:01.949
The real thing starts now.

202
00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:04.451
FIRST TEST: 50-METER DASH

203
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.828
<i>On your mark…</i>

204
00:13:07.329 --> 00:13:08.747
<i>Get set…</i>

205
00:13:12.668 --> 00:13:14.503
<i>3.04 seconds.</i>

206
00:13:16.255 --> 00:13:19.341
<i>For 50 meters.</i>
<i>I can only go up to third gear…</i>

207
00:13:20.259 --> 00:13:22.761
<i>Tenya Iida.</i>
<i>Quirk: Engine.</i>

208
00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:25.764
<i>As you can see. his legs are fast.</i>

209
00:13:26.265 --> 00:13:28.600
Well. he's like a fish in water.

210
00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:31.186
It'll be worth seeing what others do.

211
00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:32.437
TSUYU ASUI: 5.58 SECONDS

212
00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:33.772
Ribbit.

213
00:13:33.939 --> 00:13:37.276
Lighten up my clothes and shoes…

214
00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:41.655
<i>Ochaco Uraraka.</i>
<i>Quirk: Zero Gravity!</i>

215
00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:44.074
<i>Get set…</i>

216
00:13:44.908 --> 00:13:48.579
<i>She can nullify the gravitational pull</i>
<i>of any object she touches.</i>

217
00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:52.332
<i>However. if she goes over capacity.</i>
<i>she'll get really nauseous.</i>

218
00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:54.918
<i>5.49 seconds.</i>

219
00:13:55.085 --> 00:13:56.670
<i>7.15 seconds.</i>

220
00:13:57.629 --> 00:14:00.048
<i>But that's faster than I was</i>
<i>in junior high!</i>

221
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.886
Everyone.
you're not being creative enough.

222
00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:06.805
<i>-On your mark. get set…</i>
-I'll show you what it's like…

223
00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:09.183
to be allowed to use your Quirk!

224
00:14:10.225 --> 00:14:13.187
<i>Yuga Aogama.</i>
<i>Quirk: Navel Laser!</i>

225
00:14:14.146 --> 00:14:15.981
<i>He can shoot a laser from his bellybutton.</i>

226
00:14:18.901 --> 00:14:20.569
<i>He's limited by the amount</i>
<i>of time he can shoot continuously.</i>

227
00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:22.821
<i>5.51 seconds.</i>

228
00:14:24.239 --> 00:14:27.659
If I shoot for more than a second.
I get a stomachache.

229
00:14:28.619 --> 00:14:30.370
<i>What the heck?</i>

230
00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:34.625
<i>Looking at the upper limit of your Quirks</i>
<i>and the room for growth in each result.</i>

231
00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:38.462
<i>it becomes clear</i>
<i>what you can and can't do.</i>

232
00:14:39.505 --> 00:14:42.049
<i>On your mark. get set…</i>

233
00:14:42.883 --> 00:14:46.053
<i>That will connect to the creativity</i>
<i>needed for you to survive.</i>

234
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.222
Explosive speed!

235
00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:52.267
4.13 seconds.

236
00:14:53.185 --> 00:14:56.146
<i>Katsuki Bakugo.</i>
<i>Quirk: Explosion!</i>

237
00:14:57.689 --> 00:14:58.732
<i>7.02 seconds.</i>

238
00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:02.986
When I use both hands.
the force disperses…

239
00:15:04.863 --> 00:15:06.198
Deku is…

240
00:15:06.365 --> 00:15:08.158
<i>There are seven more tests.</i>

241
00:15:08.325 --> 00:15:12.204
<i>I'm sure everyone will use their Quirks</i>
<i>to produce some extraordinary results.</i>

242
00:15:14.498 --> 00:15:19.336
<i>On the other hand. I have this power</i>
<i>that will break my body if I use it once.</i>

243
00:15:19.503 --> 00:15:21.713
<i>Control…</i>

244
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.633
<i>Even if I have the image in my head.</i>
<i>when I have to actually use it…</i>

245
00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.095
<i>The trick to controlling it</i>

246
00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:29.805
is…

247
00:15:31.306 --> 00:15:32.432
feeling!

248
00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:34.893
Wow. that's All Might for you!

249
00:15:35.477 --> 00:15:38.063
You've already pulled out the 100%.

250
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:40.107
It destroyed me. though.

251
00:15:40.274 --> 00:15:41.984
But now that you have. it'll be easy.

252
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.777
You should've already grasped
the feeling.

253
00:15:43.944 --> 00:15:44.862
What was it like?

254
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:50.450
It was like a "bzzt" or a "whoosh"!
Um…

255
00:15:50.617 --> 00:15:51.618
I know!

256
00:15:52.327 --> 00:15:54.663
<i>Like an egg put into a microwave!</i>

257
00:15:56.415 --> 00:15:57.749
That's boring. but unique!

258
00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:00.085
If that's the image you have.

259
00:16:00.252 --> 00:16:01.837
then lower the wattage.

260
00:16:02.004 --> 00:16:03.297
or shorten the cook time.

261
00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:07.718
Anything's fine. just focus on the image
of the egg not exploding.

262
00:16:09.303 --> 00:16:10.679
<i>The image?</i>

263
00:16:11.138 --> 00:16:13.056
You have three weeks until school starts.

264
00:16:13.223 --> 00:16:15.976
Keep focusing on that image.

265
00:16:16.143 --> 00:16:18.437
It won't happen overnight.

266
00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:20.480
but I'm sure you will be able

267
00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:22.524
<i>to do it someday.</i>

268
00:16:27.321 --> 00:16:29.656
SECOND TEST: GRIP STRENGTH

269
00:16:30.324 --> 00:16:33.160
<i>The image of the egg not exploding…</i>

270
00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:41.043
Wow!

271
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:44.296
Five hundred and forty kilograms?
What are you. a gorilla?

272
00:16:45.422 --> 00:16:46.924
Oh. an octopus?

273
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.635
Octopuses are sexy.

274
00:16:51.345 --> 00:16:53.680
THIRD TEST: STANDING LONG JUMP

275
00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:03.565
<i>Control…</i>

276
00:17:03.732 --> 00:17:05.567
FOURTH TEST: REPEATED SIDE STEPS

277
00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:11.114
FIFTH TEST: BALL THROW

278
00:17:22.084 --> 00:17:23.460
Infinity?

279
00:17:23.961 --> 00:17:26.003
That's amazing! She got "infinity"!

280
00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:31.677
<i>This is bad. It's not something simple</i>
<i>that I can just do right away.</i>

281
00:17:31.844 --> 00:17:34.346
<i>Everyone's leaving at least</i>
<i>one amazing result…</i>

282
00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:38.392
<i>All that's left is this.</i>
<i>the long-distance run.</i>

283
00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:40.227
<i>sit-ups. and the seated toe-touch.</i>

284
00:17:40.394 --> 00:17:42.521
<i>It's now or never.</i>

285
00:17:42.688 --> 00:17:44.982
<i>At this rate. I'll be last.</i>

286
00:17:46.608 --> 00:17:49.027
It doesn't look good for Midoriya
if he continues like this.

287
00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:52.364
Huh? Of course not.
He's a Quirkless small fry. you know.

288
00:17:53.156 --> 00:17:56.660
Quirkless? Are you not aware
of what he did in the entrance exam?

289
00:17:56.827 --> 00:17:57.995
Huh?

290
00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:00.998
<i>It's about time. huh?</i>

291
00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:06.336
<i>Izuku! You're really cool.</i>

292
00:18:06.837 --> 00:18:09.673
<i>You can become a hero.</i>

293
00:18:15.095 --> 00:18:16.513
<i>I'll definitely become one!</i>

294
00:18:22.561 --> 00:18:24.021
<i>Forty-six meters.</i>

295
00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:29.860
I was definitely
trying to use it just now…

296
00:18:30.652 --> 00:18:31.862
I erased your Quirk.

297
00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:39.286
That entrance exam was definitely
not rational enough.

298
00:18:40.037 --> 00:18:43.624
Even a kid like you was accepted.

299
00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:45.834
You erased my Quirk?

300
00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:49.338
Those goggles… I see!

301
00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:53.926
<i>You can erase other people's Quirks</i>
<i>with your Quirk just by looking at them.</i>

302
00:18:54.635 --> 00:18:57.304
<i>The Erasure Hero: Eraser Head!</i>

303
00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.141
Eraser? I don't know him.

304
00:19:01.308 --> 00:19:04.520
I've heard of him.
He's an underground hero.

305
00:19:04.937 --> 00:19:09.024
<i>He doesn't like media attention</i>
<i>because he says it hinders his work.</i>

306
00:19:10.359 --> 00:19:15.030
<i>That's right. Young Midoriya.</i>
<i>He and I don't get along.</i>

307
00:19:16.156 --> 00:19:19.034
From what I can tell.
you can't control your Quirk. can you?

308
00:19:20.619 --> 00:19:24.998
Do you intend to become incapacitated
again and have someone save you?

309
00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:27.042
That's not my intention…

310
00:19:28.877 --> 00:19:30.879
Whatever your intention.

311
00:19:31.046 --> 00:19:34.675
I'm saying that's what those around you
will be forced to do.

312
00:19:35.467 --> 00:19:39.847
In the past. there was
an oppressively passionate hero

313
00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:43.016
who saved over a thousand people
by himself and created a legend.

314
00:19:43.183 --> 00:19:45.102
Even if you have
the same reckless valor.

315
00:19:45.269 --> 00:19:49.231
you'll just be decked and turn into
a useless doll after saving one person.

316
00:19:49.815 --> 00:19:51.441
Izuku Midoriya.

317
00:19:51.608 --> 00:19:54.194
With your power.
you can't become a hero.

318
00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:06.540
I've returned your Quirk.

319
00:20:06.707 --> 00:20:08.333
You have two turns for the ball throw.

320
00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.460
Hurry up and get it over with.

321
00:20:15.299 --> 00:20:17.176
-It looks like he received some advice.
-Are you worried about him?

322
00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:19.511
Probably just telling him he's expelled.

323
00:20:19.678 --> 00:20:21.096
I'm not at all.

324
00:20:21.263 --> 00:20:22.723
Who are you?

325
00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:25.350
What should I do?
Which should I choose?

326
00:20:25.726 --> 00:20:28.312
<i>Will he incorrigibly prepare</i>
<i>for an honorable defeat here</i>

327
00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:30.105
<i>by using all his strength.</i>

328
00:20:30.272 --> 00:20:33.317
<i>or become intimidated</i>
<i>and settle into last place?</i>

329
00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:36.862
<i>No matter which he chooses.</i>
<i>he has no potential.</i>

330
00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:39.907
<i>I still can't control my power.</i>

331
00:20:40.449 --> 00:20:43.243
<i>Should I let everything I can do</i>
<i>hang on this one throw?</i>

332
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:47.623
<i>Even All Might said that</i>
<i>it wouldn't happen overnight.</i>

333
00:20:48.123 --> 00:20:49.208
<i>This is no good!</i>

334
00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:51.293
<i>If that's my only choice.</i>
<i>then I just have to go all out!</i>

335
00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:53.795
<i>Zero potential.</i>

336
00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:00.802
<i>It's just as Mr. Aizawa says.</i>

337
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:06.725
<i>At this rate.</i>
<i>there's no way I'll become a hero.</i>

338
00:21:09.228 --> 00:21:10.521
Hey. hey. is he serious?

339
00:21:11.313 --> 00:21:14.983
<i>I have to work</i>
<i>a lot harder than other people!</i>

340
00:21:17.319 --> 00:21:19.112
<i>That's why. with all my strength…</i>

341
00:21:19.738 --> 00:21:22.032
<i>I'll do what I can right now!</i>

342
00:21:24.535 --> 00:21:26.078
Smash!

343
00:21:31.333 --> 00:21:34.461
<i>It doesn't hurt as much as before…</i>

344
00:21:35.546 --> 00:21:39.716
<i>Do you intend to become incapacitated</i>
<i>again and have someone save you?</i>

345
00:21:46.765 --> 00:21:47.683
Mr. Aizawa…

346
00:21:53.522 --> 00:21:55.816
I can still move!

347
00:21:57.901 --> 00:21:59.653
This kid…

348
00:22:00.487 --> 00:22:03.657
<i>I came because I was worried.</i>
<i>but what the heck. young man?</i>

349
00:22:04.408 --> 00:22:06.201
<i>You still couldn't control your power.</i>

350
00:22:06.368 --> 00:22:09.162
<i>but you also</i>
<i>couldn't become incapacitated.</i>

351
00:22:09.329 --> 00:22:12.165
<i>So. you propelled the ball</i>
<i>at the last point of contact</i>

352
00:22:12.875 --> 00:22:16.628
<i>by sending the power of One For All</i>
<i>to just your fingertip.</i>

353
00:22:17.337 --> 00:22:20.841
<i>minimizing the injury</i>
<i>while maximizing the power!</i>

354
00:22:22.384 --> 00:22:24.344
<i>What the heck. young man?</i>

355
00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:28.473
<i>You're so cool!</i>

356
00:24:01.024 --> 00:24:02.860

<i>Deku. let's do our best together</i>
<i>in combat training.</i>

360
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:13.620
<i>Uraraka? I talked to a girl again!</i>

361

<i>Looks like we're up against</i>
<i>Team Iida and Bakugo.</i>

<i>Deku's going to put bunny ears</i>
<i>on his head! It's so cute!</i>

365
