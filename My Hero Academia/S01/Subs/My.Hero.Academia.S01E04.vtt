<i>U.A. High School's hero course.</i>

2
00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.341
<i>A training school for those</i>
<i>whose goal is to acquire</i>

3
00:00:07.508 --> 00:00:09.843
<i>the necessary qualifications needed</i>
<i>for pro heroes.</i>

4
00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:11.803
<i>Among similar courses</i>
<i>across the country.</i>

5
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.972
<i>theirs is the most popular</i>
<i>and most competitive.</i>

6
00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.975
<i>and their acceptance rate is less than</i>
<i>one in three hundred every year.</i>

7
00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:21.021
<i>The hero who refused</i>
<i>a National Honor Award…</i>

8
00:00:22.064 --> 00:00:24.525
<i>The number one hero. All Might.</i>

9
00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:27.861
<i>The hero who resolved</i>
<i>the most incidents in history…</i>

10
00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:31.281
<i>The Fiery Hero. Endeavor.</i>

11
00:00:32.406 --> 00:00:34.952
<i>The winner of the Best Jeanist award</i>
<i>eight years in a row…</i>

12
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.703
<i>Best Jeanist.</i>

13
00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:41.792
<i>Graduating from U.A. is a requirement</i>
<i>for becoming a great hero.</i>

14
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.256
<i>And so. I also tackled</i>
<i>the U.A. entrance exam.</i>

15
00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:48.507
<i>I will take</i>

16
00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:53.178
<i>the first step toward my dream</i>
<i>of becoming a hero!</i>

BATTLE CENTER B

19
00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:30.943
What is this?

20
00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.319
It's like a city!

21
00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:35.405
They have more than one of these
on the school grounds?

22
00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:37.783
U.A.'s amazing!

23
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.244
As it says
in the application requirements.

24
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.082
you listeners will be conducting
ten-minute mock urban battles after this!

25
00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:50.546
Three different types of faux villains
are stationed in each battle center.

26
00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:54.049
You earn points for each of them
based on their level of difficulty.

27
00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:58.220
<i>Your goal. dear listeners.</i>
<i>is to use your Quirks</i>

28
00:02:58.387 --> 00:03:01.014
<i>to earn points by immobilizing</i>
<i>the faux villains.</i>

29
00:03:02.641 --> 00:03:04.768
Mock battles…

30
00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:09.064
<i>How can everyone be so confident?</i>

31
00:03:09.231 --> 00:03:10.691
<i>Aren't they nervous?</i>

32
00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:14.778
<i>They even have equipment</i>
<i>to go with their Quirks…</i>

33
00:03:15.654 --> 00:03:18.615
<i>Oh. it's the person I met</i>
<i>at the school gates! The nice person!</i>

34
00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:20.701
<i>She was assigned</i>
<i>to the same battle center. huh?</i>

35
00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:24.371
<i>Oh yeah. I have to thank her for earlier.</i>

36
00:03:27.291 --> 00:03:28.542
<i>He's here. too?</i>

37
00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:32.462
That girl appears to be trying to focus.

38
00:03:33.422 --> 00:03:34.840
What are you doing here?

39
00:03:35.007 --> 00:03:36.800
Are you taking the entrance exam
to interfere with everyone else?

40
00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:38.594
No. of course not…

41
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.680
That guy's the one who was about to trip
in front of the school gates. right?

42
00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:44.433
The one who winced
after being called out.

43
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.269
At the very least. we have one less rival
to worry about. huh?

44
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.397
Lucky for us.

45
00:03:51.315 --> 00:03:53.859
<i>I feel like the others think</i>
<i>they lucked out because I'm here…</i>

46
00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:56.111
Okay. start!

47
00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.781
What's wrong?
There are no countdowns in real fights!

48
00:04:00.282 --> 00:04:01.450
Run. run!

49
00:04:01.617 --> 00:04:03.285
The die has been cast. you know!

50
00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:05.537
Huh? Huh?

51
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.290
What?

52
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:12.544
I'm behind already!

53
00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:16.548
EPISODE FOUR: START LINE

54
00:04:17.798 --> 00:04:18.800
<i>I'm behind.</i>

55
00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:22.971
<i>Calm down. It's fine!</i>

56
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.599
<i>I have All Might with me.</i>

DAGOBA MUNICIPAL BEACH PARK

58
00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:31.855
All right! You swallowed the hair. right?

59
00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:36.318
I don't feel any different. though.

60
00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:39.238
Of course not!

61
00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:42.157
What do you think the stomach does?

62
00:04:42.324 --> 00:04:45.827
Well. you'll feel something
in two or three hours.

63
00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:47.788
I'm so nervous…

64
00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:51.792
I need to hurry back. take a shower.
and eat breakfast.

65
00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:53.919
You have become a proper vessel.

66
00:04:54.086 --> 00:04:56.547
but it was one
that was made in a hurry.

67
00:04:57.798 --> 00:05:00.217
You didn't even get
to take it for a test drive.

68
00:05:00.384 --> 00:05:03.303
Prepare yourself for the physical
repercussions it'll have on your body.

69
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.596
Huh?

70
00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:08.892
I don't have time to explain in detail.
so I'll just tell you this.

71
00:05:09.935 --> 00:05:13.021
<i>When you use my Quirk. One For All.</i>

72
00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:17.568
<i>squeeze your buttocks</i>
<i>and yell this inside your heart:</i>

73
00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:18.902
<i>"S…"</i>

74
00:05:21.864 --> 00:05:23.031
One point!

75
00:05:24.575 --> 00:05:27.744
<i>Target acquired. I'll kill you!</i>

76
00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:31.039
<i>It's coming!</i>

77
00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:34.585
<i>Why can't I move?</i>

78
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.713
<i>Idiot. why?</i>

79
00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:43.594
Thanks for distracting it!

80
00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:46.263
A laser?

81
00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:51.143
<i>Merci !</i>
We made a good team.

82
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.855
But I don't think we'll meet again.

83
00:05:55.731 --> 00:05:56.899
<i>Adieu !</i>

84
00:05:57.566 --> 00:05:58.859
We won't meet again?

85
00:05:59.026 --> 00:06:01.695
<i>Six minutes and two seconds left!</i>

86
00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:04.323
Oh no! Oh no!

87
00:06:04.865 --> 00:06:05.908
<i>Points…</i>

88
00:06:06.283 --> 00:06:07.868
<i>I need points fast!</i>

89
00:06:19.755 --> 00:06:20.672
The nice person!

90
00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:28.472
Release!

91
00:06:33.227 --> 00:06:35.020
That's 28 points!

92
00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:37.439
<i>What? 28?</i>

93
00:06:42.361 --> 00:06:43.654
Forty-five points!

94
00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:45.405
Forty-five?

95
00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:47.366
That's 32!

96
00:06:47.533 --> 00:06:49.034
That one's mine! Don't take it!

97
00:06:49.201 --> 00:06:51.578
It's first-come. first-served!

98
00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:54.122
<i>The number of enemies</i>
<i>is decreasing fast!</i>

99
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.166
<i>Oh no!</i>

100
00:06:56.834 --> 00:06:58.460
In this practical exam.

101
00:06:58.627 --> 00:07:00.087
the examinees have not been informed

102
00:07:00.254 --> 00:07:02.464
of the number of villains
or their locations.

103
00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:04.925
They have a limited amount
of time in a vast area.

104
00:07:05.092 --> 00:07:07.469
They have to draw the villains out
from there.

105
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.096
Information gathering ability

106
00:07:09.263 --> 00:07:11.348
to understand
the situation before anyone else.

107
00:07:11.932 --> 00:07:14.852
Mobility that can be used
in many different circumstances.

108
00:07:15.227 --> 00:07:18.856
Discernment to be able
to stay calm in any situation.

109
00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:21.900
And pure combat ability.

110
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.488
These basic abilities needed
to keep the peace in the streets

111
00:07:26.655 --> 00:07:28.866
are turned into points in this test.

112
00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:31.743
Doesn't this year's group look promising?

113
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.454
Well. we can't know for sure yet.

114
00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:38.959
Their true test is still to come.

115
00:08:00.606 --> 00:08:03.025
An obstacle
that will go crazy in narrow spaces.

116
00:08:03.609 --> 00:08:06.445
I recommend
that you listeners try to avoid it.

117
00:08:07.738 --> 00:08:09.198
<i>Isn't it a little too big?</i>

118
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.173
<i>An overwhelming threat.</i>

119
00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:30.969
<i>How people act after they've seen this</i>
<i>shows their true nature.</i>

120
00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:36.308
<i>This isn't funny! I have to run away!</i>
<i>I'll get points as I run…</i>

121
00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:39.520
<i>Shoot. I'm still at zero points!</i>

122
00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:42.563
Less than two minutes left!

123
00:08:43.357 --> 00:08:44.274
Two minutes?

124
00:08:45.943 --> 00:08:48.862
<i>It'll be wasted.</i>
<i>Everything All Might gave me</i>

125
00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:51.156
<i>will be wasted!</i>

126
00:08:52.533 --> 00:08:53.575
Ow!

127
00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:11.343
<i>It'd be bad luck if you fell. right?</i>

128
00:09:17.933 --> 00:09:22.312
<i>There is absolutely no merit</i>
<i>in taking on that faux villain.</i>

129
00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:25.315
<i>But that creates the opportunity</i>

130
00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:27.234
<i>for it to shine brightly…</i>

131
00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:32.281
…and rise to the surface.

132
00:09:42.666 --> 00:09:45.002
<i>Squeeze your buttocks</i>

133
00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:47.754
<i>and yell this inside your heart:</i>

134
00:09:50.007 --> 00:09:53.260
<i>Smash!</i>

135
00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:03.187
That's right.

136
00:10:04.146 --> 00:10:05.689
<i>It rises to the surface.</i>

137
00:10:05.856 --> 00:10:08.192
<i>The most important</i>
<i>qualification of a hero…</i>

138
00:10:09.985 --> 00:10:13.405
The spirit of self-sacrifice!

139
00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:28.670
<i>The conditions are the same</i>
<i>as when I tried</i>

140
00:10:28.837 --> 00:10:30.672
<i>to save Kacchan.</i>

141
00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:35.636
<i>But it's different. This time…</i>

142
00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:40.849
One minute left!

143
00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:49.900
<i>Wait. this is All Might's power.</i>

144
00:10:50.067 --> 00:10:52.236
<i>I'm able to jump this high now.</i>

145
00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:56.949
<i>Landing should be</i>
<i>a piece of cake…</i>

146
00:10:58.867 --> 00:10:59.785
<i>"Break"?</i>

147
00:11:03.622 --> 00:11:08.126
<i>You have become a proper vessel.</i>
<i>but it was one that was made in a hurry.</i>

148
00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:10.671
<i>Prepare yourself for the physical</i>
<i>repercussions it'll have on your body.</i>

149
00:11:11.213 --> 00:11:13.632
<i>Oh yeah! I'm such an idiot!</i>

150
00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:17.761
<i>A mere ten months</i>
<i>was just barely enough time.</i>

151
00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:23.016
<i>I can just barely hold</i>
<i>this borrowed power.</i>

152
00:11:23.517 --> 00:11:25.644
<i>I was being conceited for a second!</i>

153
00:11:27.855 --> 00:11:32.067
<i>I've only been given the right</i>
<i>to stand at the start line!</i>

154
00:11:37.656 --> 00:11:40.117
<i>Think! What to do? What to do?</i>

155
00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:42.786
<i>Detroit Smash!</i>

156
00:11:43.453 --> 00:11:45.789
<i>If I aim that move at the ground!</i>

157
00:11:45.956 --> 00:11:48.375
<i>Both my legs and my right arm are broken.</i>

158
00:11:48.542 --> 00:11:49.668
<i>I only have my left arm!</i>

159
00:11:50.127 --> 00:11:51.253
<i>And the timing…</i>

160
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.963
<i>If I'm too early or too late. I'll die!</i>

161
00:11:53.422 --> 00:11:55.591
<i>Even if I succeed.</i>
<i>I still won't have any points!</i>

162
00:11:57.134 --> 00:12:01.805
<i>If I break my left arm.</i>
<i>there's no way I'll pass!</i>

163
00:12:18.864 --> 00:12:19.823
Release…

164
00:12:32.044 --> 00:12:33.879
<i>I'm safe…</i>

165
00:12:34.046 --> 00:12:36.590
<i>No. she saved me.</i>

166
00:12:37.716 --> 00:12:42.346
<i>Is she all right?</i>
<i>She looks uninjured. at least.</i>

167
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.182
<i>I'm so glad…</i>

168
00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:47.893
<i>And…</i>

169
00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:50.270
<i>Thank you!</i>

170
00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:54.399
<i>If I can just get one point…</i>

171
00:12:54.858 --> 00:12:58.153
Time's up!

172
00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:24.763
What was that guy?

173
00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:27.349
He suddenly jumped at the obstacle.

174
00:13:27.516 --> 00:13:32.479
He seemed to have a reinforcement-type
Quirk. but that was unusual…

175
00:13:32.646 --> 00:13:35.232
But if he had such an amazing Quirk.

176
00:13:35.399 --> 00:13:36.817
<i>what kind of life did he live</i>

177
00:13:36.984 --> 00:13:39.069
<i>that made him so jumpy?</i>

178
00:13:39.236 --> 00:13:41.613
<i>Maybe he was acting to trick others?</i>

179
00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:45.951
But it doesn't look like
he gained anything from doing so.

180
00:13:46.118 --> 00:13:50.080
Anyway. there's no mistaking
that he's an amazing guy.

181
00:13:50.664 --> 00:13:52.583
<i>They're missing the point.</i>

182
00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:54.459
<i>Didn't they see?</i>

183
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.590
<i>He jumped out to save that girl.</i>

184
00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:04.344
<i>He was aware of the remaining time.</i>
<i>his own safety.</i>

185
00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:06.972
<i>and the points he needed to pass…</i>

186
00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:11.435
<i>And even so. he did not hesitate at all!</i>

187
00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:20.110
<i>If we had not been in an exam…</i>

188
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.157
<i>of course. I would have done the same!</i>

189
00:14:26.408 --> 00:14:29.953
<i>Wait. "Exam"? "Of course"?</i>

190
00:14:30.996 --> 00:14:32.414
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

191
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.542
Okay. good work.

192
00:14:36.668 --> 00:14:39.171
Good work. good work.

193
00:14:39.338 --> 00:14:40.631
Here you go. Here are some gummies.

194
00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:42.382
Eat some gummies.

195
00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:44.635
Thanks.

196
00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:46.970
Yes. yes. you. too.

197
00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:48.680
Thanks…

198
00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:52.768
That<i> mademoiselle</i>
is the backbone of U.A.

199
00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:59.733
Oh dear. you were hurt
this much by your own Quirk?

200
00:15:00.984 --> 00:15:04.780
<i>It's as if his body is not used</i>
<i>to his Quirk yet.</i>

201
00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:10.410
Kiss!

202
00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:12.496
OLD LADY!

203
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:14.581
What was that?

204
00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:16.542
U.A. High's licensed school nurse.

205
00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:21.088
The Youthful Heroine. Recovery Girl!

206
00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:26.510
Her Quirk is the super-activation
of healing ability.

207
00:15:27.302 --> 00:15:33.141
U.A. can only go through with such
a reckless entrance exam because of her.

208
00:15:35.477 --> 00:15:38.397
Let's finish this quickly.
Is anyone else injured?

209
00:15:39.857 --> 00:15:44.653
<i>I see!</i>
<i>If this exam is set up like that…</i>

210
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.615
<i>Then he's…</i>

211
00:15:53.954 --> 00:15:56.707
ONE WEEK LATER

212
00:16:01.628 --> 00:16:02.546
Izuku?

213
00:16:04.423 --> 00:16:07.342
Izuku? Izuku?

214
00:16:09.011 --> 00:16:10.721
Hey. are you all right?

215
00:16:10.888 --> 00:16:12.681
Why are you smiling at the fish?

216
00:16:12.848 --> 00:16:15.142
Oh. sorry! I'm fine!

217
00:16:20.772 --> 00:16:25.360
<i>From self-scoring. I know that</i>
<i>I just barely passed the written exam.</i>

218
00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:31.366
<i>But that was cancelled out</i>
<i>by the big fat zero in the practical exam.</i>

219
00:16:32.409 --> 00:16:36.872
<i>And ever since the entrance exam.</i>
<i>I hadn't been able to contact All Might.</i>

220
00:16:40.459 --> 00:16:44.087
The results should arrive
today or tomorrow. right?

221
00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:45.380
Yeah…

222
00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:50.636
Jeez. I think it's amazing
that you even applied to U.A.!

223
00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:51.887
Yeah…

224
00:16:52.513 --> 00:16:54.348
NEIGHBORHOOD CIRCULAR

225
00:16:55.057 --> 00:16:58.393
<i>I didn't even tell my mother</i>
<i>about what had happened with All Might.</i>

226
00:16:59.394 --> 00:17:04.398
<i>I kept that secret so he could continue</i>
<i>being the Symbol of Peace.</i>

227
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.945
<i>There was no way I could tell anyone.</i>
<i>not even my family.</i>

228
00:17:16.286 --> 00:17:21.040
<i>All Might! After you saw potential in me.</i>
<i>I'm sorry I didn't live up to it!</i>

229
00:17:21.208 --> 00:17:25.212
<i>But I did what I thought was right.</i>

230
00:17:26.088 --> 00:17:28.715
<i>All Might. you…</i>

231
00:17:34.012 --> 00:17:35.430
Izuku!

232
00:17:35.973 --> 00:17:37.474
It's here! It came!

233
00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:39.434
It's here!

234
00:18:03.876 --> 00:18:06.378
<i>I am here as a projection!</i>

235
00:18:06.879 --> 00:18:08.172
All Might?

236
00:18:08.881 --> 00:18:10.674
Wait. this is from U.A.. right?

237
00:18:10.841 --> 00:18:11.884
What?

238
00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:16.513
<i>I had to do some paperwork that took</i>
<i>some time. so I couldn't contact you.</i>

239
00:18:18.015 --> 00:18:19.558
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

240
00:18:20.684 --> 00:18:26.607
<i>Actually. I came to this town</i>
<i>to work at U.A.</i>

241
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.235
<i>All Might is working at U.A.?</i>

242
00:18:32.446 --> 00:18:33.864
<i>Hm? What is it?</i>

243
00:18:34.031 --> 00:18:35.282
<i>Wrap it up?</i>

244
00:18:35.449 --> 00:18:38.785
<i>But there is something</i>
<i>I must talk to him about…</i>

245
00:18:38.952 --> 00:18:41.288
<i>It's going to push everything else back?</i>

246
00:18:41.455 --> 00:18:44.333
<i>All right. Okay.</i>

247
00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:51.381
<i>Even if you passed the written exam.</i>
<i>you got zero points on the practical exam.</i>

248
00:18:51.548 --> 00:18:53.175
<i>Of course. that means you didn't pass…</i>

249
00:18:55.177 --> 00:18:56.386
<i>I knew that.</i>

250
00:18:57.679 --> 00:18:58.972
<i>I knew that.</i>

251
00:19:00.057 --> 00:19:01.725
<i>I knew that. but…</i>

252
00:19:04.603 --> 00:19:06.605
<i>It's so frustrating…</i>

253
00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:10.317
<i>…if that was all there was to it.</i>

254
00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:15.405
<i>I am an entertainer. as well!</i>

255
00:19:15.572 --> 00:19:18.367
<i>First. take a look at this video!</i>

256
00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:22.871
<i>Excuse me. um…</i>

257
00:19:24.373 --> 00:19:25.624
The nice person?

258
00:19:25.791 --> 00:19:29.419
<i>She came to negotiate</i>
<i>directly in person after the exam!</i>

259
00:19:30.629 --> 00:19:32.256
<i>Negotiate what?</i>

260
00:19:32.422 --> 00:19:33.966
<i>Keep watching to find out!</i>

261
00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:40.055
<i>Um. the person</i>
<i>with curly hair and freckles…</i>

262
00:19:40.222 --> 00:19:41.932
<i>Do you know who I'm talking about?</i>

263
00:19:42.099 --> 00:19:43.934
<i>Um… kind of plain-looking…</i>

264
00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:45.727
It's me!

265
00:19:45.894 --> 00:19:50.148
<i>Is it possible for me to give him</i>
<i>some of my points?</i>

266
00:19:51.942 --> 00:19:56.238
<i>I heard him say.</i>
<i>"If I can just get one point."</i>

267
00:19:56.947 --> 00:19:59.992
<i>so I thought maybe</i>
<i>he was still at zero points…</i>

268
00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:03.161
<i>What the hell can you do?</i>

269
00:20:03.328 --> 00:20:05.998
<i>At least the points he lost</i>
<i>because of me…</i>

270
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:10.210
<i>There was absolutely no reason</i>
<i>for you to put yourself in danger!</i>

271
00:20:10.586 --> 00:20:12.379
<i>He saved me!</i>

272
00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:18.844
Please! Please!

273
00:20:20.637 --> 00:20:22.389
<i>In addition to now having a Quirk.</i>

274
00:20:22.556 --> 00:20:24.600
<i>your actions spurred others to act.</i>

275
00:20:29.938 --> 00:20:34.234
<i>The entrance exam the other day</i>
<i>was not graded only on villain points!</i>

276
00:20:36.612 --> 00:20:39.656
<i>Even if you ask to.</i>
<i>you cannot give him your points.</i>

277
00:20:39.823 --> 00:20:43.368
<i>Anyway. there's no reason</i>
<i>to give him any. female listener!</i>

278
00:20:46.038 --> 00:20:52.419
<i>How can a hero course reject people</i>
<i>who save others and do the right thing?</i>

279
00:20:52.586 --> 00:20:54.588
<i>Call that lip service?</i>

280
00:20:55.547 --> 00:20:56.840
<i>Bring it on!</i>

281
00:20:57.007 --> 00:20:59.551
<i>This is a job</i>
<i>that requires risking one's life</i>

282
00:20:59.718 --> 00:21:01.678
<i>to put that lip service into practice!</i>

283
00:21:03.055 --> 00:21:04.181
<i>Rescue points!</i>

284
00:21:05.474 --> 00:21:07.184
<i>And they're given by a panel of judges.</i>

285
00:21:07.768 --> 00:21:11.563

<i>we at U.A. look at!</i>
