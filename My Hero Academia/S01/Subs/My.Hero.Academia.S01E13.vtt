1
00:00:02.044 --> 00:00:03.711
A hero…

2
00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:06.882
can always break out of a tough spot!

3
00:00:09.468 --> 00:00:10.511
Hey villain.

4
00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:14.973
have you ever heard these words?

5
00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:18.185
Go beyond!

6
00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:20.229
Plus…

7
00:00:20.896 --> 00:00:23.815
Ultra!

8
00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:36.620
I really have gotten weaker…

9
00:00:36.787 --> 00:00:40.874
In my prime.
five hits would've been enough.

10
00:00:44.503 --> 00:00:47.381
But it took more than 300 hits.

11
00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:55.681
<i>And now… I'm out of time.</i>

12
00:00:57.474 --> 00:00:58.809
Now. villains…

13
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.146
I'm sure we'd all like to end this
as soon as possible.

14
00:01:05.274 --> 00:01:07.901
<i>Weaker? No way.</i>

15
00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:10.445
<i>We've been completely overwhelmed.</i>

16
00:01:11.697 --> 00:01:13.907
<i>I can't believe he did that to my Nomu…</i>

17
00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:16.869
<i>Did he use a cheat?</i>

18
00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:51.255
Hands up.

19
00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:54.091
No Quirks allowed.

20
00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:56.969
If you use your Quirks.
I'll kill this guy.

21
00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.137
Kaminari!

22
00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:01.723
He got us.
We let our guard down completely.

23
00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:05.561
An ambush after they made us think
we got all of them.

24
00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:07.771
I can't believe we didn't predict this.

25
00:03:09.106 --> 00:03:13.235
I don't wanna kill someone
who's an electric-type. like me.

26
00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:14.820
but I guess I have to. huh?

27
00:03:16.572 --> 00:03:17.990
An electric-type…

28
00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:21.159
He was probably the one Todoroki said
was jamming communications.

29
00:03:25.664 --> 00:03:27.207
I'm going over there.

30
00:03:27.583 --> 00:03:29.418
Don't move a muscle.

31
00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:35.799
Electric-types like you and Kaminari
are born winners. right?

32
00:03:36.258 --> 00:03:37.176
Huh?

33
00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:38.302
What are you…

34
00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:41.388
I mean. even if you aren't a hero.
there are a ton of jobs you could do.

35
00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:42.556
You're in great demand. right?

36
00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:44.850
It's just an innocent thought.

37
00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:49.271
I'm just wondering.
why is someone like you a villain?

38
00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:51.106
<i>I see.</i>

39
00:03:51.273 --> 00:03:55.194
<i>Jiro can attack without moving</i>
<i>as long as she gets her plug in.</i>

40
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.530
It's fine if you don't want to answer.

41
00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:00.157
Give it up.

42
00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:02.826
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

43
00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:09.708
A kid's naïve thinking
only works on dumb adults.

44
00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.587
Novice heroes
shouldn't make light of hostages.

45
00:04:14.505 --> 00:04:18.425
If you two don't put up a fight.
I'll let this idiot go.

46
00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.597
Someone else's life.

47
00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:26.391
or your own.

48
00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:31.563
Now. Don't move.

49
00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:36.401
EPISODE 13:
IN EACH OF OUR HEARTS

50
00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:45.118
<i>Hey. what's going on?</i>

51
00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:48.914
<i>He's not any weaker at all.</i>

52
00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:53.877
<i>Did that guy lie to me?</i>

53
00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:56.171
What's wrong?

54
00:04:56.964 --> 00:04:58.674
You're not coming?

55
00:04:58.841 --> 00:05:01.718
You said you'd "clear" this
or something. right?

56
00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:04.638
Come and get me if you can.

57
00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:08.892
All Might…

58
00:05:09.268 --> 00:05:13.313
As expected. it looks like
there is no need for us to fight.

59
00:05:15.232 --> 00:05:17.651
Midoriya!
We should get out of here now!

60
00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:21.280
It'll be worse if we end up
getting taken hostage instead!

61
00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:25.409
<i>No… He's bluffing.</i>

62
00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.245
<i>It's almost lost under the cloud of dust.</i>

63
00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:31.957
<i>but I can see the steam-like substance</i>
<i>that comes out when he transforms.</i>

64
00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:35.961
<i>All Might is…</i>

65
00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.965
<i>I can't move anymore…</i>

66
00:05:40.132 --> 00:05:42.384
<i>That Nomu thing was too strong…</i>

67
00:05:43.552 --> 00:05:48.015
<i>Frankly. if I move even one step.</i>
<i>I won't be able to keep up this bluff.</i>

68
00:05:48.182 --> 00:05:50.142
<i>I'll go back to by true form.</i>

69
00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:53.103
<i>Just a little more…</i>

70
00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:55.230
Well? What's wrong?

71
00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:57.983
<i>Hesitate.</i>

72
00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:03.947
<i>If I can stall for just a little longer…</i>

73
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.538
If only I had Nomu…

74
00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:14.041
That guy would've been able
to go up against him

75
00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:15.918
without thinking about anything!

76
00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.170
Tomura Shigaraki!

77
00:06:18.337 --> 00:06:20.380
Please calm yourself.

78
00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.383
Looking carefully.
I see that he was definitely weakened

79
00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.136
from the damage of Nomu's attacks.

80
00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:33.018
Besides. the children
appear to be frozen in fear.

81
00:06:34.353 --> 00:06:36.980
We still have underlings who can be used.

82
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.985
There are likely only a few minutes left
before reinforcements come.

83
00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:44.571
If you and I work together.

84
00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:47.533
we still have a chance of killing him.

85
00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:52.538
Yeah…

86
00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:57.417
That's right…

87
00:06:58.252 --> 00:06:59.670
We have no choice but to do it.

88
00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:05.008
I mean. we have the last boss
right in front of our eyes.

89
00:07:07.803 --> 00:07:10.806
All Might will do something
about the main bad guys.

90
00:07:10.973 --> 00:07:12.975
Let's go help the others!

91
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:15.727
Midoriya?

92
00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:19.690
<i>I'm the only one who knows…</i>

93
00:07:19.857 --> 00:07:22.401
<i>The mist guy</i>
<i>is probably more dangerous.</i>

94
00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:28.448
<i>All Might</i>
<i>has most likely gone past his limit.</i>

95
00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:33.328
<i>If the mist guy toys with him. I'm sure…</i>

96
00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:36.665
<i>You're coming. huh?</i>

97
00:07:37.416 --> 00:07:39.793
This is revenge for Nomu!

98
00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:42.838
<i>Jeez. holy shit!</i>

99
00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:47.718
<i>Hurry!</i>

100
00:07:48.719 --> 00:07:51.221
<i>Everyone. hurry!</i>

101
00:07:56.018 --> 00:07:57.603
He's fast.

102
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.564
<i>I'm the only who knows</i>
<i>the predicament he's in!</i>

103
00:08:00.731 --> 00:08:01.690
Midoriya!

104
00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:06.737
<i>They're broken…</i>
<i>even though I controlled it earlier…</i>

105
00:08:06.904 --> 00:08:08.906
<i>But I made it!</i>

106
00:08:09.072 --> 00:08:10.449
<i>The hidden part of his body!</i>

107
00:08:10.616 --> 00:08:12.993
<i>As long as I aim at that.</i>
<i>I can blow him away!</i>

108
00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:20.709
Get away from All Might!

109
00:08:23.462 --> 00:08:24.505
<i>This hand is…</i>

110
00:08:27.299 --> 00:08:28.717
<i>the one from back then?</i>

111
00:08:29.343 --> 00:08:31.136
I won't fall for that again!

112
00:08:43.524 --> 00:08:44.525
Are they here?

113
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.910
This attack…

114
00:08:55.786 --> 00:08:56.912
Could it be…

115
00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:00.916
Sorry. everyone!

116
00:09:01.667 --> 00:09:02.751
Sorry we're late!

117
00:09:03.544 --> 00:09:06.088
I gathered
all who were immediately available.

118
00:09:07.506 --> 00:09:08.841
Iida!

119
00:09:09.675 --> 00:09:12.427
I. Tenya Iida.
class 1-A representative.

120
00:09:13.637 --> 00:09:15.889
have now returned!

121
00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:48.589
Split up and protect the students!

122
00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:50.048
Yes. sir!

123
00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:55.262
Aw man. they're here.

124
00:09:56.722 --> 00:09:58.098
It's game over now.

125
00:09:59.141 --> 00:10:01.393
Shall we go home
and try again later. Kurogi…

126
00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:08.442
Someone whose Quirk
can capture them all from this distance…

127
00:10:08.609 --> 00:10:09.735
<i>Me!</i>

128
00:10:10.861 --> 00:10:11.945
Tomura Shigaraki!

129
00:10:13.614 --> 00:10:15.115
This is…

130
00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:18.118
Thirteen!

131
00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:24.124
I may have failed this time.

132
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.627
but I will kill you next time…

133
00:10:28.504 --> 00:10:32.466
Symbol of Peace. All Might!

134
00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:50.901
<i>What the pros deal with…</i>

135
00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:53.403
<i>What they fight against…</i>

136
00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:55.781
<i>The world of evil…</i>

137
00:10:56.615 --> 00:11:01.662
<i>That was an experience</i>
<i>that we were not ready for yet.</i>

138
00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:15.634
I wasn't… able to do anything…

139
00:11:16.593 --> 00:11:18.345
That's not true.

140
00:11:23.058 --> 00:11:25.894
If it weren't for those few seconds
you bought me.

141
00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:28.188
I would've been killed.

142
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.943
You saved me again.

143
00:11:35.696 --> 00:11:37.656
All Might…

144
00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:49.209
I'm… so glad you're okay!

145
00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:02.347
My goodness…

146
00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:04.391
I can't believe we let them escape

147
00:12:04.558 --> 00:12:06.602
after they made such a big show
of trespassing.

148
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.479
They caught us
completely unguarded. huh?

149
00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:12.482
More importantly. we must make sure
the students are safe.

150
00:12:14.818 --> 00:12:18.071
If this many pro heroes
have gathered here.

151
00:12:18.864 --> 00:12:21.742
then it looks like
they did not attack the whole school.

152
00:12:21.909 --> 00:12:22.868
Midoriya!

153
00:12:23.285 --> 00:12:24.620
Oh. Kirishima…

154
00:12:25.329 --> 00:12:26.455
Are you all right?

155
00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:30.334
<i>Young Kirishima. I applaud</i>
<i>your concern for your friend!</i>

156
00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:34.838
<i>But wait. he'll find out.</i>
<i>Crap. wait! Damn it!</i>

157
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.467
Kirishima. wai…

158
00:12:41.845 --> 00:12:44.223
We want to make sure
that all the students are safe.

159
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:46.016
so please gather in front of the gate.

160
00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:49.019
We will deal with the injured here.

161
00:12:49.478 --> 00:12:51.772
That makes sense! Roger that!

162
00:12:52.231 --> 00:12:55.526
Hey. he said to gather
in front of the gate!

163
00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:00.614
Thanks.

164
00:13:00.781 --> 00:13:02.866
You saved me. Cementoss.

165
00:13:03.033 --> 00:13:05.410
I am a fan of yours. too.

166
00:13:06.203 --> 00:13:08.497
<i>Cementoss!</i>
<i>Quirk: Cement.</i>

167
00:13:09.081 --> 00:13:11.875
<i>He can manipulate</i>
<i>the cement he touches like clay.</i>

168
00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:14.169
<i>He's super strong</i>
<i>in modern society!</i>

169
00:13:15.254 --> 00:13:18.632
Let's get you to the nurse's office
while keeping you hidden.

170
00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:21.760
But man.
you act recklessly every time. huh?

171
00:13:21.927 --> 00:13:24.888
If I didn't act recklessly.
I would've been killed.

172
00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:28.809
That was how strong the enemy was.

173
00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:35.524
KARAOKE

174
00:13:35.691 --> 00:13:37.943
SAUNA - MAHJONG

175
00:13:45.284 --> 00:13:46.159
Ouch…

176
00:13:47.202 --> 00:13:49.663
I was shot in both arms and both legs…

177
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:51.415
We lost completely…

178
00:13:51.582 --> 00:13:53.375
Even Nomu was defeated!

179
00:13:53.542 --> 00:13:56.003
All the underlings
were defeated in an instant.

180
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.589
Those kids were strong…

181
00:14:00.382 --> 00:14:03.927
The Symbol of Peace was healthy…

182
00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:06.847
You were wrong. Master!

183
00:14:07.014 --> 00:14:08.348
<i>No. I wasn't.</i>

184
00:14:09.141 --> 00:14:11.602
<i>We were just not prepared enough.</i>

185
00:14:11.768 --> 00:14:14.188
<i>Yes. we underestimated them.</i>

186
00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:18.233
<i>It's good that we did it under that cheap</i>
<i>"League of Villains" name.</i>

187
00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:23.322
<i>By the way. what about Master</i>
<i>and my joint creation. Nomu?</i>

188
00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:24.990
<i>He was not retrieved?</i>

189
00:14:26.617 --> 00:14:27.868
He was blown away.

190
00:14:28.202 --> 00:14:29.411
What?

191
00:14:29.578 --> 00:14:32.206
More precisely. without coordinates
to his precise location.

192
00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:35.459
I could not find him. even with my warp.

193
00:14:35.626 --> 00:14:38.003
I did not have time for that.

194
00:14:38.462 --> 00:14:42.758
<i>After all we did to make him</i>
<i>as powerful as All Might!</i>

195
00:14:42.925 --> 00:14:46.261
<i>Well. I suppose it cannot be helped.</i>
<i>That's unfortunate.</i>

196
00:14:46.887 --> 00:14:48.222
Power…

197
00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:53.936
That's right. There was one child
who was as fast as All Might.

198
00:14:54.978 --> 00:14:56.188
<i>Oh?</i>

199
00:14:57.314 --> 00:14:59.608
If he hadn't gotten in the way.

200
00:14:59.775 --> 00:15:02.945
we might have been able to kill All Might.

201
00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:07.157
<i>That brat…</i>

202
00:15:07.533 --> 00:15:09.785
<i>Of course you have regrets.</i>

203
00:15:09.952 --> 00:15:13.038
<i>But this was not a futile exercise.</i>

204
00:15:13.622 --> 00:15:15.582
<i>Gather the elite.</i>

205
00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:18.502
<i>Take all the time you need.</i>

206
00:15:18.669 --> 00:15:24.049
<i>We cannot move freely.</i>
<i>which is why we need a symbol. like you.</i>

207
00:15:24.842 --> 00:15:26.844
<i>Tomura Shigaraki.</i>

208
00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:31.181
<i>Next time. show the world</i>
<i>that you are to be feared.</i>

209
00:15:39.815 --> 00:15:43.026
…16. 17. 18. 19.

210
00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:45.654
Other than the boy
with both legs seriously injured.

211
00:15:45.821 --> 00:15:47.114
everyone else seems unharmed.

212
00:15:47.823 --> 00:15:49.324
Ojiro.

213
00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:51.368
I heard you were fired up this time.

214
00:15:51.535 --> 00:15:53.287
You were strong by yourself. huh?

215
00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:56.081
I thought everyone was by themselves.

216
00:15:56.248 --> 00:15:58.292
I survived by using hit-and-run tactics.

217
00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:01.086
-Where were you. Hagakure?
-In the landslide area!

218
00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:04.047
Todoroki was super strong.
I was surprised!

219
00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:07.134
Anyway. I'm glad you weren't hurt.

220
00:16:07.301 --> 00:16:10.095
<i>I almost froze her…</i>
<i>That was close.</i>

221
00:16:10.637 --> 00:16:13.724
Where… do you think I was?

222
00:16:14.141 --> 00:16:17.477
I see. so the people you fought
were also just hooligans?

223
00:16:17.644 --> 00:16:19.313
They underestimated us
'cause we were kids.

224
00:16:19.646 --> 00:16:20.564
Where…

225
00:16:20.731 --> 00:16:23.734
So it was All Might
who put the hole in the dome after all?

226
00:16:23.901 --> 00:16:25.652
That's some crazy power.

227
00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:26.987
Yeah. as expected of All Might.

228
00:16:27.362 --> 00:16:28.655
Where do you think I was?

229
00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:29.698
Where?

230
00:16:29.865 --> 00:16:31.450
It's a secret!

231
00:16:31.617 --> 00:16:33.994
Let's have the students
return to their classroom for now.

232
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.664
We won't be questioning them
right away. anyway. right?

233
00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:40.459
Detective. what about Mr. Aizawa?

234
00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.215
<i>Comminuted fractures</i>
<i>in both arms and a facial fracture.</i>

235
00:16:46.381 --> 00:16:48.717
<i>Fortunately. there does not seem to be</i>
<i>any serious brain damage.</i>

236
00:16:49.468 --> 00:16:53.305
<i>However. his orbital floor has broken</i>
<i>into small pieces.</i>

237
00:16:53.472 --> 00:16:56.642
<i>and his eyes may suffer</i>
<i>from its aftereffects.</i>

238
00:16:57.726 --> 00:16:58.769
That's what he said.

239
00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:00.562
Ribbit…

240
00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:01.647
No…

241
00:17:02.105 --> 00:17:05.150
-What about Thirteen?
-Thirteen has been treated.

242
00:17:05.983 --> 00:17:08.612
<i>The laceration from the back</i>
<i>to upper arm was bad.</i>

243
00:17:08.779 --> 00:17:10.071
<i>but Thirteen will survive.</i>

244
00:17:11.865 --> 00:17:14.826
All Might will also survive.

245
00:17:14.992 --> 00:17:18.247
Recovery Girl's healing
is enough to treat him.

246
00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:19.790
so he's in the nurse's office.

247
00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:21.791
-Deku!
-What about Midoriya?

248
00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:23.292
Midori…

249
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.171
Oh. treatment in the nurse's office
is enough for him. too.

250
00:17:27.214 --> 00:17:28.632
Oh. good…

251
00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:31.260
-Now. go back to your classroom.
-Okay.

252
00:17:33.095 --> 00:17:36.056
Sansa. I also have some business
in the nurse's office.

253
00:17:36.223 --> 00:17:37.891
-I'll leave the rest to you.
-Yes. sir!

254
00:17:38.058 --> 00:17:39.101
<i>It's a cat.</i>

255
00:17:39.268 --> 00:17:40.769
<i>Not a dog. huh?</i>

256
00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:50.237
<i>Damn.</i>

257
00:17:50.654 --> 00:17:52.281
Bakugo!
He said to go back to the classroom!

258
00:17:53.031 --> 00:17:54.908
I know. bastard!

259
00:18:00.455 --> 00:18:03.917
We need to make some drastic
improvements to school security. don't we?

260
00:18:04.084 --> 00:18:04.960
Yes.

261
00:18:05.127 --> 00:18:08.255
A warp Quirk is already very rare.

262
00:18:09.423 --> 00:18:11.884
but for a villain to have one.
of all things…

263
00:18:17.014 --> 00:18:18.599
Detective Tsukauchi!

264
00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:21.185
We received word
that someone thought to be a villain

265
00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:23.312
was captured in a grove of trees
on school grounds.

266
00:18:23.478 --> 00:18:24.354
<i>How is it?</i>

267
00:18:24.521 --> 00:18:27.566
<i>He has no apparent injuries</i>
<i>and seemed docile. not resisting capture.</i>

268
00:18:27.733 --> 00:18:29.776
<i>He does not respond</i>
<i>even when called out to.</i>

269
00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:30.944
<i>so he is thought to be mute.</i>

270
00:18:33.655 --> 00:18:37.993
Principal. we would like to investigate
every corner of the school. just in case.

271
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.536
Of course!

272
00:18:39.703 --> 00:18:43.373
Some people might complain.
but you police have more authority.

273
00:18:43.832 --> 00:18:46.627
Investigating is what you're good at.
I'm counting on you!

274
00:18:48.629 --> 00:18:50.547
Teams. proceed with the investigation
of the school!

275
00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:01.767
NURSE'S OFFICE

276
00:19:02.518 --> 00:19:06.230
Because of the situation this time.
I can't really scold you…

277
00:19:07.689 --> 00:19:09.274
I'm not sure.

278
00:19:09.441 --> 00:19:11.860
but I think I might've shortened
the time limit of my hero form again.

279
00:19:12.986 --> 00:19:15.531
I hope I still have at least an hour.

280
00:19:15.697 --> 00:19:16.990
All Might…

281
00:19:17.366 --> 00:19:19.243
Well. it can't be helped.

282
00:19:19.409 --> 00:19:20.494
These things happen.

283
00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:28.585
Excuse me.

284
00:19:29.753 --> 00:19:31.296
All Might. it's been a while.

285
00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:33.715
Tsukauchi! You're here. too?

286
00:19:33.882 --> 00:19:36.635
All Might!
Is it all right to show that form?

287
00:19:36.802 --> 00:19:39.096
Yeah. it's fine. Why?

288
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:43.725
Because he's Naomasa Tsukauchi.
my best friend in the force.

289
00:19:44.768 --> 00:19:46.520
What's with that introduction?

290
00:19:46.687 --> 00:19:49.565
Sorry to cut to the chase. but All Might.
can you give me details about the vill…

291
00:19:49.731 --> 00:19:50.816
Wait! Please. wait!

292
00:19:51.233 --> 00:19:53.068
More importantly.
are all the students okay?

293
00:19:53.235 --> 00:19:56.738
What about Aizawa…
Eraser Head and Thirteen?

294
00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:59.408
Other than that boy.
only a few students had light injuries.

295
00:20:00.033 --> 00:20:03.787
and the two teachers
are in stable condition for now.

296
00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:05.664
I see.

297
00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.917
<i>If you three heroes</i>
<i>had not risked your lives.</i>

298
00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:12.462
then the students
would not have survived.

299
00:20:13.255 --> 00:20:15.924
You're wrong about one thing. Tsukauchi.

300
00:20:16.842 --> 00:20:19.678
The students also fought
and risked their lives.

301
00:20:21.763 --> 00:20:23.182
All Might…

302
00:20:24.516 --> 00:20:28.812
<i>Have there even been any first-years</i>
<i>who experienced a real fight so soon.</i>

303
00:20:28.979 --> 00:20:33.817
<i>survived. and learned of fear</i>
<i>and the world of adults?</i>

304
00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:37.571
The villains did something dumb.

305
00:20:38.989 --> 00:20:40.991
This class is strong.

306
00:20:41.158 --> 00:20:43.035
They will become strong heroes.

307
00:20:48.123 --> 00:20:50.584
I am certain of that.

308
00:23:15.145 --> 00:23:16.563

Sure. Be careful on your way home.
