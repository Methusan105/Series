00:00:02.085 --> 00:00:03.045
Hey!

2
00:00:03.212 --> 00:00:05.297
Deku has a Quirk. right?

3
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.675
You saw that extraordinary strength.
didn't you?

4
00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.803
<i>Did he dare trick me?</i>

5
00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:14.348
<i>That damn nerd!</i>

6
00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:18.602
He's a piece of work.

7
00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:23.565
but his goal. his confidence.
his physical strength. and his Quirk

8
00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:27.110
are way more amazing than mine.

9
00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:31.031
But that's why right now…

10
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:35.911
I don't want to lose.

11
00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:39.957
<i>Now. let's start</i>
<i>the indoor person-to-person</i>

12
00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:43.710
<i>combat training</i>
<i>with Team A and Team D!</i>

13
00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:53.178
Come Deku. don't dodge.

14
00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:56.056
I won't do so much damage
that this fight gets stopped.

15
00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:57.516
but I'm gonna get close!

16
00:00:59.852 --> 00:01:02.062
Wow. he's like a martial arts master!

17
00:01:02.688 --> 00:01:03.647
<i>What's with this guy?</i>

18
00:01:04.313 --> 00:01:06.191
<i>Did he read my moves?</i>

19
00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:18.996
My "Deku" isn't always
going to mean "useless"!

20
00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:21.665
Kacchan.

21
00:01:21.832 --> 00:01:25.919
my "Deku" means "You can do it!"

22
00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:00.848
<i>Because Kacchan and I</i>
<i>lived in the same neighborhood.</i>

23
00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.141
<i>we've known each other</i>
<i>since we were little.</i>

24
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.355
NO TRESPASSING
YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE!

25
00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:11.900
Let's go kill the enemy!

26
00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:13.318
Okay!

27
00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:15.195
Okay!

28
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.074
<i>He was the type who could do</i>
<i>anything he tried his hand at.</i>

29
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:21.577
<i>a rascal who led the group</i>
<i>of neighborhood kids.</i>

30
00:03:22.286 --> 00:03:25.998
<i>Good or bad.</i>
<i>Kacchan was full of confidence.</i>

31
00:03:26.707 --> 00:03:29.001
<i>and I thought he was so cool.</i>

32
00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:33.172
<i>But…</i>

33
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:36.341
<i>after his Quirk manifested.</i>

34
00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:40.512
<i>it accelerated him</i>
<i>down the wrong path.</i>

35
00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.851
Even though you're scared…

36
00:03:46.852 --> 00:03:50.522
That's what I hate about you!

37
00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:54.985
<i>All men are not created equal.</i>

38
00:03:56.486 --> 00:04:01.325
<i>This was the reality I learned</i>
<i>about society at the young age of four.</i>

39
00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:05.329
EPISODE SEVEN:
DEKU VS. KACCHAN

40
00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:09.082
<i>Hey. Bakugo!</i>
<i>Give me your status!</i>

41
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.918
<i>What happened?</i>

42
00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:12.669
Just shut up and defend.

43
00:04:13.462 --> 00:04:15.839
<i>I'm really angry right now!</i>

44
00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:17.966
I'm not asking about how you feel!

45
00:04:18.132 --> 00:04:19.301
Hey!

46
00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:21.220
He hung up…

47
00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:24.223
Going off on his own like that…

48
00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.725
What is wrong with him?
Jeez!

49
00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:29.937
What was Bakugo saying?

50
00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:33.398
Can't tell with just the cameras
in a fixed position and no sound.

51
00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:36.443
He's talking to his partner
over the small wireless radio.

52
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.947
You can bring that
plus the building's floor plan.

53
00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:42.824
and this capture tape!

54
00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:45.369
Once you wrap this around your opponent.

55
00:04:45.536 --> 00:04:47.079
it shows that you've captured them.

56
00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:49.540
The time limit is 15 minutes.

57
00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:52.334
and the heroes don't know where
the nuclear weapon is located. right?

58
00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:53.377
Yes!

59
00:04:53.544 --> 00:04:57.130
The heroes are clearly
at a disadvantage here!

60
00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:00.008
Heroes should be able to turn the tables
on whatever predicament they're in.

61
00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:03.470
Besides. didn't Mr. Aizawa tell you. too?

62
00:05:03.637 --> 00:05:04.596
You know…

63
00:05:06.557 --> 00:05:07.558
Here we go!

64
00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:09.268
Plus Ultra!

65
00:05:09.935 --> 00:05:11.562
<i>Monsieur</i>. Bakugo is…

66
00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:16.733
Uraraka. go!

67
00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:22.155
Looking away?
You must be sure of yourself.

68
00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:25.242
<i>The capture tape?</i>

69
00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:29.496
<i>Hero notebook number ten.</i>
<i>page 18!</i>

70
00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.375
<i>I'm glad I got to see</i>
<i>Eraser Head's moves in person!</i>

71
00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:36.461
<i>What's next?</i>
<i>If it's Kacchan. he'll be impatient</i>

72
00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:38.922
<i>and swing with his right again!</i>

73
00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:41.884
<i>I was right!</i>

74
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.677
That guy's amazing!

75
00:05:43.844 --> 00:05:45.470
He's not even using his Quirk

76
00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:47.347
fighting against the guy
who finished first in the entrance exam!

77
00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:52.102
<i>He was always good</i>
<i>at reacting quickly in a crisis.</i>

78
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:59.318
<i>He spent years writing</i>
<i>his notes and internalizing them.</i>

79
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.740
<i>That fanboy knowledge</i>
<i>is now paying off</i>

80
00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:07.659
<i>as it propels him forward.</i>

81
00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:13.207
<i>He kicked first this time</i>
<i>to keep me from predicting his moves.</i>

82
00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:15.584
<i>He's being cautious now.</i>

83
00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.256
Come back here. Deku!

84
00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:26.887
<i>I can't get close to him</i>
<i>as easily anymore.</i>

85
00:06:27.054 --> 00:06:28.055
<i>I need a plan.</i>

86
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.150
Hey! You tricked me. didn't you?

87
00:06:40.317 --> 00:06:42.152
Was it fun tricking me all this time?

88
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.908
Huh? You've got a flashy Quirk there.
don't you?

89
00:06:48.492 --> 00:06:50.369
Try and get me with it!

90
00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:54.873
'Cause I'm better than you!

91
00:06:55.541 --> 00:06:58.377
He seems real angry. It's scary!

92
00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:05.259
<i>I had heard from young Midoriya</i>
<i>that young Bakugo is a mass of pride.</i>

93
00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:08.387
<i>but that mass has gotten too big.</i>

94
00:07:19.648 --> 00:07:22.401
<i>He completely ignored Uraraka</i>
<i>and shot at me.</i>

95
00:07:22.568 --> 00:07:23.861
I knew it.

96
00:07:24.027 --> 00:07:25.988
<i>If they were going to send</i>
<i>an advance guard.</i>

97
00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:28.240
<i>it would've been better to send Iida.</i>
<i>who has more mobility.</i>

98
00:07:28.407 --> 00:07:30.576
<i>and I'm sure Kacchan knows that.</i>

99
00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:32.703
<i>That probably means</i>
<i>he's running wild on his own.</i>

100
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.205
<i>and the two of them</i>
<i>aren't working together.</i>

101
00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:39.042
<i>In the first place.</i>
<i>our chances of winning are lowest</i>

102
00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:41.920
<i>if we have a head-to-head battle</i>
<i>with those two.</i>

103
00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:43.088
CURRENT LOCATION - VILLAIN HIDEOUT

104
00:07:43.255 --> 00:07:45.757
<i>If Uraraka and I both went to the hideout.</i>
<i>that's what would happen.</i>

105
00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:48.385
<i>and even if the two of us stayed here</i>
<i>to fight Kacchan.</i>

106
00:07:48.552 --> 00:07:50.387
<i>we're in danger of running out of time.</i>

107
00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:52.222
<i>This is fine.</i>

108
00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:55.517
<i>All that's left is for Uraraka</i>
<i>to find the weapon and Iida.</i>

109
00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:57.561
<i>and then I'll head over</i>
<i>for a two-on-one fight.</i>

110
00:07:57.728 --> 00:07:59.021
<i>That's how we can win.</i>

111
00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:03.775
<i>That's assuming</i>
<i>I can beat Kacchan. though.</i>

112
00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:06.153
<i>It's fine.</i>

113
00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:09.239
<i>As long as I'm careful of his palms.</i>
<i>I can do this.</i>

114
00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:10.741
Where are you?

115
00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.202
You damn nerd!

116
00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:18.290
<i>And I forgot to tell you. Kacchan…</i>

117
00:08:18.874 --> 00:08:20.709
You're Quirkless!

118
00:08:20.876 --> 00:08:23.837
How can you even stand
in the same ring as me?

119
00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:27.257
It's not like I'm trying
to compete with you or anything!

120
00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:28.926
Believe me!

121
00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:31.678
<i>I take back everything I said!</i>

122
00:08:37.226 --> 00:08:39.144
That's why… I'm going!

123
00:08:42.231 --> 00:08:43.982
My "Deku" means "You can do it!"

124
00:08:44.942 --> 00:08:46.860
<i>He's just a pebble!</i>

125
00:08:47.903 --> 00:08:49.363
<i>Wow. Kacchan!</i>

126
00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:52.115
This is easy!

127
00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:53.784
Ow!

128
00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:58.455
Izuku. you really can't do anything.
can you?

129
00:08:58.622 --> 00:08:59.498
IZUKU (DEKU) MIDORIYA

130
00:08:59.665 --> 00:09:02.084
You can read the characters
for "Izuku" as "Deku." you know.

131
00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.378
Kacchan. you can read?

132
00:09:04.545 --> 00:09:05.963
You can't?

133
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.592
And "Deku" means
someone who can't do anything!

134
00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:12.094
Really?

135
00:09:12.261 --> 00:09:13.595
Stop that…

136
00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:16.807
<i>Why don't you know?</i>

137
00:09:20.394 --> 00:09:22.229
Kacchan.
how many times did yours skip?

138
00:09:22.396 --> 00:09:23.355
Seven!

139
00:09:23.522 --> 00:09:25.357
-Wow!
-That's Kacchan for ya!

140
00:09:25.858 --> 00:09:26.900
What about you. Deku?

141
00:09:28.235 --> 00:09:29.987
Zero times…

142
00:09:32.573 --> 00:09:34.199
<i>Why can't you do it?</i>

143
00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:38.662
Wow!

144
00:09:38.829 --> 00:09:40.789
-Lucky!
-That's so cool!

145
00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:44.126
Wow. that's an amazing Quirk!

146
00:09:44.293 --> 00:09:45.294
It really is!

147
00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.297
It's a flashy Quirk just right for a hero.
Right. Katsuki?

148
00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:53.135
<i>Oh. I see! I'm amazing!</i>

149
00:09:54.261 --> 00:09:57.514
<i>No one is as amazing as I am!</i>

150
00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:00.559
You're so lucky. Kacchan.

151
00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:03.228
Your Quirk's so cool!

152
00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:05.397
I hope I get mine soon. too.

153
00:10:05.981 --> 00:10:10.277
No matter what Quirk you get.
you'll never beat me.

154
00:10:12.029 --> 00:10:14.281
<i>He's just a pebble!</i>

155
00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:17.075
<i>Hey. did you hear?</i>

156
00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:19.328
Deku doesn't have a Quirk.

157
00:10:19.494 --> 00:10:20.913
What? Really?

158
00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:23.207
Yeah. it's called being "Quirkless."

159
00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:24.666
That's so lame.

160
00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:26.210
-Too bad for him.
-He's so weird!

161
00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:28.754
Don't worry about it. Izuku.

162
00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:31.173
<i>You're the least amazing. Deku.</i>

163
00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:38.889
<i>Forward march. members</i>
<i>of the Bakugo Hero Agency!</i>

164
00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:42.726
Kacchan!

165
00:10:42.893 --> 00:10:44.770
Hey. are you okay?

166
00:10:44.937 --> 00:10:47.564
He's fine. Kacchan's real strong!

167
00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:49.233
See?

168
00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:51.735
<i>I was fine!</i>

169
00:10:51.902 --> 00:10:53.737
Hurry up and get back up here!

170
00:10:53.904 --> 00:10:55.989
'Kay. no problem!

171
00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.742
<i>Nothing was wrong!</i>

172
00:11:01.787 --> 00:11:04.164
Are you all right? Can you stand?

173
00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:11.296
It would've been bad
if you hit your head.

174
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.843
<i>Don't look at me with that face!</i>

175
00:11:16.385 --> 00:11:19.513
You looked like you were asking for help…

176
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.639
<i>Stop it!</i>

177
00:11:21.974 --> 00:11:23.475
<i>I'm…</i>

178
00:11:23.642 --> 00:11:25.894
<i>I'm better than him!</i>

179
00:11:29.398 --> 00:11:30.482
<i>Found it.</i>

180
00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:35.946
Now I just have to tell Deku
and hide until he gets here.

181
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:42.744
Bakugo is a natural at being bad.
but that fits this training perfectly.

182
00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:45.914
Then I must also devote
myself to being a villain.

183
00:11:46.248 --> 00:11:47.165
That's right.

184
00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:49.168
This is another trial
to turn me into a man

185
00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:51.420
who will not bring shame
to the Iida family.

186
00:11:51.587 --> 00:11:52.921
Become a villain!

187
00:11:53.088 --> 00:11:56.675
Be dyed with evil
in order to become a hero!

188
00:11:57.801 --> 00:11:59.553
I am…

189
00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.055
extremely evil!

190
00:12:03.182 --> 00:12:04.308
<i>He's taking this so seriously!</i>

191
00:12:05.267 --> 00:12:06.768
Have you arrived. Uraraka?

192
00:12:11.148 --> 00:12:12.983
I knew that you would come here alone

193
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.028
the instant Bakugo ran off by himself.

194
00:12:16.195 --> 00:12:19.239
Your Quirk allows you to make
the objects you touch float.

195
00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:25.204
That is why I put away all the things
on this floor before you arrived.

196
00:12:25.704 --> 00:12:28.665
Now you cannot play your little tricks!

197
00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:30.918
You have blundered. hero!

198
00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:34.963
He's starting to look…
like a villain!

199
00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:38.175
<i>Deku!</i>

200
00:12:38.342 --> 00:12:39.885
Uraraka! How's it going?

201
00:12:40.052 --> 00:12:42.471
Iida found me. Sorry!

202
00:12:42.638 --> 00:12:44.139
-I'm evil!
-Right now. he's slowly…

203
00:12:44.306 --> 00:12:45.224
<i>Where are you?</i>

204
00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:48.101
<i>The middle of the fifth floor.</i>

205
00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:50.479
Almost directly above!

206
00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:53.065
<i>We probably</i>
<i>don't have much time left. either.</i>

207
00:12:53.232 --> 00:12:55.150
<i>If we run out of time.</i>
<i>our opponents win!</i>

208
00:12:56.568 --> 00:12:57.986
<i>I can't…</i>

209
00:12:58.862 --> 00:13:01.448
<i>I can't lose this fight!</i>

210
00:13:07.788 --> 00:13:08.872
They're loaded.

211
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:10.666
Kacchan.

212
00:13:10.832 --> 00:13:13.919
Why won't you use your Quirk?

213
00:13:14.503 --> 00:13:17.548
Are you saying you can win
even if you don't use it?

214
00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:20.175
Are you underestimating me. Deku?

215
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.554
<i>I have no choice but to do it.</i>

216
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.098
<i>I can do it. I can!</i>

217
00:13:26.932 --> 00:13:30.060
I'm not scared of you anymore!

218
00:13:34.064 --> 00:13:37.860
With your stalking.
you probably already know.

219
00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:40.529
but my Quirk. Explosion.

220
00:13:40.696 --> 00:13:42.322
lets me secrete nitroglycerin-like sweat

221
00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:43.949
from the sweat glands
on the palm of my hand

222
00:13:44.116 --> 00:13:45.534
and make it explode.

223
00:13:46.577 --> 00:13:49.121
If they made this the way I asked.

224
00:13:49.288 --> 00:13:52.082
then these gauntlets will store
the nitroglycerin inside them. and…

225
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.085
<i>Don't tell me that's…</i>

226
00:13:55.252 --> 00:13:57.004
Young Bakugo. stop!

227
00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:01.341
<i>-Are you trying to kill him?</i>
<i>-</i> If I don't hit him. he won't die!

228
00:14:10.851 --> 00:14:12.436
This is supposed to be a class!

229
00:14:12.603 --> 00:14:13.812
Young man!

230
00:14:13.979 --> 00:14:15.355
Young Midoriya!

231
00:14:23.197 --> 00:14:26.241
Is that… even allowed?

232
00:14:29.703 --> 00:14:31.163
Wow…

233
00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.501
The more that's stored in these gauntlets.
the stronger the blast.

234
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:42.132
Come on. use your Quirk. Deku…

235
00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:49.932
I'll force you to surrender
even if you're at full strength.

236
00:14:58.774 --> 00:15:00.567
Bakugo. answer me!

237
00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:03.654
Did you do that?
What in the world did you do?

238
00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.364
<i>-This is my chance!</i>
<i>-</i> Explain yourself!

239
00:15:05.531 --> 00:15:07.783
<i>If we retrieve the weapon. we'll win!</i>

240
00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:11.787
I won't let you. hero!

241
00:15:16.208 --> 00:15:18.919
<i>We need to touch the weapon itself</i>
<i>for it to count as being retrieved.</i>

242
00:15:19.378 --> 00:15:21.797
Can she make herself float now. too?

243
00:15:21.964 --> 00:15:23.465
Release!

244
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:27.302
It's a special move
that's hard on my body!

245
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.436
Your Quirk is not a threat
if you cannot touch anything.

246
00:15:36.937 --> 00:15:40.107
I'll hold out until time runs out!

247
00:15:42.985 --> 00:15:45.362
<i>Deku's trying so hard. though!</i>

248
00:15:46.363 --> 00:15:48.657
Hey. hey. what's wrong. Deku?

249
00:15:49.324 --> 00:15:51.994
I didn't hit you.
so you can still move. can't you?

250
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.579
Come and get me!

251
00:15:54.246 --> 00:15:56.540
<i>The explosion shot out.</i>

252
00:15:56.707 --> 00:16:00.836
<i>He had his costume made so that his Quirk</i>
<i>would work even for long distances.</i>

253
00:16:02.212 --> 00:16:04.590
-Uraraka. what's the situation?
-<i>Deku!</i>

254
00:16:06.008 --> 00:16:07.885
Ignoring me again?

255
00:16:08.051 --> 00:16:09.595
I can't believe him!

256
00:16:10.012 --> 00:16:11.847
Sir. you should stop them!

257
00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:14.600
That Bakugo's really crazy!

258
00:16:14.766 --> 00:16:16.185
He's gonna kill him!

259
00:16:16.351 --> 00:16:17.269
No…

260
00:16:17.436 --> 00:16:20.772
I won't do so much damage that this fight
gets stopped. but I'm gonna get close!

261
00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:23.108
If I don't hit him. he won't die!

262
00:16:24.443 --> 00:16:26.945
<i>Strangely enough.</i>
<i>part of him is still sane.</i>

263
00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:30.032
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if it's small-minded or what.</i>

264
00:16:30.199 --> 00:16:31.116
<i>but anyway…</i>

265
00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:32.951
Young Bakugo.

266
00:16:33.118 --> 00:16:36.580
the next time you use that. I'll stop
the fight. and your team will lose.

267
00:16:36.747 --> 00:16:37.915
Huh?

268
00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:41.126
<i>To attack on such a large scale inside</i>
<i>is inviting the destruction</i>

269
00:16:41.293 --> 00:16:43.337
<i>of the stronghold</i>
<i>you should be protecting.</i>

270
00:16:43.504 --> 00:16:47.132
<i>That is a foolish plan</i>
<i>for both heroes and villains!</i>

271
00:16:47.549 --> 00:16:49.718
<i>You will lose a lot of points for it!</i>

272
00:16:53.263 --> 00:16:56.767
<i>As a teacher. I should stop this.</i>

273
00:16:57.518 --> 00:16:58.519
<i>However…</i>

274
00:17:01.605 --> 00:17:02.689
Go to the pillar by the windows!

275
00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:04.483
-Over and out!
-Fine. then!

276
00:17:05.067 --> 00:17:06.944
Let's fight it out with our fists!

277
00:17:08.904 --> 00:17:10.906
<i>It's no good. I can't dodge it!</i>

278
00:17:11.073 --> 00:17:13.242
<i>A counterattack!</i>
<i>Watch the timing…</i>

279
00:17:13.407 --> 00:17:14.451
<i>Now!</i>

280
00:17:19.414 --> 00:17:20.499
What was that just now?

281
00:17:21.875 --> 00:17:26.046
He doesn't look like the type to think.
but he's more subtle than I expected.

282
00:17:27.297 --> 00:17:28.298
What do you mean?

283
00:17:28.464 --> 00:17:31.885
<i>He changed his course in a blast</i>
<i>that doubled as a smoke screen</i>

284
00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:34.221
<i>and then did it again immediately.</i>

285
00:17:34.847 --> 00:17:37.850
Getting in a clean hit
while fighting against inertia

286
00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:41.520
requires fine lateral adjustments
to the power of the explosions.

287
00:17:41.687 --> 00:17:45.232
He's too talented…
Ugh…

288
00:17:46.567 --> 00:17:48.068
Look. here I come!

289
00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:52.364
It's your favorite right swing!

290
00:17:55.659 --> 00:17:56.785
Deku!

291
00:17:57.619 --> 00:17:59.580
You are…

292
00:18:01.248 --> 00:18:02.207
below me!

293
00:18:05.502 --> 00:18:08.088
<i>He's not going to give me</i>
<i>a chance to think.</i>

294
00:18:08.839 --> 00:18:11.258
<i>I couldn't do it after all…</i>

295
00:18:11.425 --> 00:18:12.801
<i>He's too strong…</i>

296
00:18:13.594 --> 00:18:16.054
<i>I have no choice but to use it…</i>

297
00:18:16.597 --> 00:18:17.806
This is a massacre!

298
00:18:17.973 --> 00:18:20.309
He can capture him for this exercise
by just wrapping the tape around him!

299
00:18:21.268 --> 00:18:23.520
Those are not the actions of a hero.

300
00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:28.025
I thought Midoriya
was pretty amazing. too.

301
00:18:28.192 --> 00:18:30.485
<i>but in terms of combat power.</i>

302
00:18:30.652 --> 00:18:34.781
<i>Bakugo is definitely</i>
<i>a ball of natural instincts.</i>

303
00:18:35.949 --> 00:18:38.785
<i>I should stop them.</i>
<i>But…</i>

304
00:18:40.454 --> 00:18:43.081
<i>I don't want to stop them. for his sake!</i>

305
00:18:47.085 --> 00:18:48.003
He's running away?

306
00:18:48.378 --> 00:18:51.798
That's not something a man should do.
but he has no choice.

307
00:18:52.758 --> 00:18:54.718
But something's strange…

308
00:18:54.885 --> 00:18:55.969
Why?

309
00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.643
Why won't you use your Quirk?

310
00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:04.478
Are you underestimating me?

311
00:19:07.606 --> 00:19:08.732
No…

312
00:19:08.899 --> 00:19:12.611
You've been like this
ever since we were kids…

313
00:19:12.778 --> 00:19:15.405
Have you been underestimating me
like that since then. you bastard?

314
00:19:17.407 --> 00:19:18.450
That's not it…

315
00:19:21.662 --> 00:19:22.579
<i>You're…</i>

316
00:19:25.249 --> 00:19:29.127
You're an amazing person.
so that's why I want to beat you!

317
00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:36.468
I want to win
and surpass you. you idiot!

318
00:19:37.261 --> 00:19:39.471
Don't look at me like that!

319
00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:41.265
You damn nerd!

320
00:19:42.724 --> 00:19:44.768
<i>These are the first passionate emotions</i>
<i>he's shown</i>

321
00:19:44.935 --> 00:19:46.270
<i>other than "I want to be a hero!"</i>

322
00:19:47.229 --> 00:19:53.318
<i>I'm sure this is necessary for you</i>
<i>to arrive at the future you're looking at.</i>

323
00:20:01.785 --> 00:20:03.787
Detroit…

324
00:20:06.874 --> 00:20:09.751
I said. this looks bad! Sir!

325
00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:20.470
Both of you. sto…

326
00:20:20.637 --> 00:20:22.139
Let's go. Uraraka!

327
00:20:22.514 --> 00:20:23.390
Okay!

328
00:20:26.935 --> 00:20:30.397
<i>There's still no way</i>
<i>I can beat you one-on-one.</i>

329
00:20:30.939 --> 00:20:32.024
<i>But…</i>

330
00:20:33.275 --> 00:20:35.110
…Smash!

331
00:20:52.628 --> 00:20:54.087
What the…

332
00:20:55.756 --> 00:20:57.716
Sorry. Iida!

333
00:20:58.592 --> 00:21:00.594
Improvised special move…

334
00:21:00.761 --> 00:21:03.388
Comet Home Run!

335
00:21:05.724 --> 00:21:08.435
You call that a home run?

336
00:21:14.942 --> 00:21:16.485
Release!

337
00:21:18.654 --> 00:21:19.821
Retrieved!

338
00:21:21.031 --> 00:21:24.284
No! The weapon!

339
00:21:28.747 --> 00:21:31.041
That's what…

340
00:21:31.208 --> 00:21:33.335
From the start. you were…

341
00:21:34.711 --> 00:21:37.965
You are underestimating me.
aren't you?

342
00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:41.385
I wasn't… going to use it…

343
00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.347
Because I can't use it…

344
00:21:45.764 --> 00:21:50.352
Because my body
can't handle the impact…

345
00:21:52.229 --> 00:21:56.441
Mr. Aizawa said so. too…

346
00:21:57.192 --> 00:21:58.944
But…

347
00:22:00.445 --> 00:22:02.322
