00:00:02.211 --> 00:00:04.046
You're so lucky. Kacchan.

2
00:00:04.213 --> 00:00:06.423
Your Quirk's so cool!

3
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.342
I hope I get mine soon. too.

4
00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:13.013
No matter what Quirk you get.
you'll never beat me.

5
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.643
<i>He's just a pebble!</i>

6
00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:20.771
<i>Until a little while ago.</i>

7
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:24.066
<i>he was just a pebble</i>
<i>on the side of the road.</i>

8
00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:31.073
You've got a flashy Quirk there.
don't you?

9
00:00:32.783 --> 00:00:36.036
<i>Hey! You tricked me. didn't you?</i>

10
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.164
<i>Was it fun tricking me all this time?</i>

11
00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:42.960
<i>Try and get me with it!</i>

12
00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:45.546
<i>'Cause I'm better than you!</i>

13
00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:53.262
What the…

14
00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:55.973
Improvised special move…

15
00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:58.058
Comet Home Run!

16
00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:00.686
You call that a home run?

17
00:01:01.812 --> 00:01:03.105
Retrieved!

18
00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:09.987
From the start. you were…

19
00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:14.157
I wasn't… going to use it.

20
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.828
Because I can't use it…

21
00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:22.624
Because my body can't handle the impact…

22
00:01:24.877 --> 00:01:29.339
Mr. Aizawa said so. too…

23
00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:30.924
But…

24
00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.678
this was all…

25
00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:36.722
I could think of…

26
00:01:39.558 --> 00:01:40.934
<i>Someone told me:</i>

27
00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:46.315
<i>"You can become a hero."</i>

28
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.111
<i>That's why…</i>

29
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.864
<i>I'm going!</i>

30
00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:31.086
<i>Indoor person-to-person combat</i>
<i>training…</i>

31
00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:33.046
-Uraraka?
<i>-Hero team…</i>

32
00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.715
<i>wins!</i>

33
00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:39.845
What the heck?

34
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:42.681
The losers are practically uninjured.

35
00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:45.225
and the winners are on the ground…

36
00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:49.521
They lost the battle.
but won the war. huh?

37
00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:51.732
This is training. though.

38
00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.532
<i>-To the nurse's office.</i>
<i>-I know.</i>

39
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:10.000
<i>My right…</i>

40
00:04:11.627 --> 00:04:13.212
<i>Deku predicted it…</i>

41
00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:18.800
<i>On top of that… he found</i>
<i>a way to win the exercise…</i>

42
00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:24.681
<i>You're an amazing person.</i>
<i>so that's why I want to beat you!</i>

43
00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:28.769
<i>I want to win and surpass you.</i>
<i>you idiot!</i>

44
00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:33.565
<i>Does that mean…</i>

45
00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:36.068
<i>even if we fought all-out…</i>

46
00:04:36.235 --> 00:04:39.780
<i>Deku would completely beat…</i>

47
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:44.284
Come back. young Bakugo.
It's time to review the results.

48
00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:47.996
Whether you win or lose.

49
00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:51.375
looking back and learning from
your experiences is a part of life.

50
00:04:51.542 --> 00:04:55.379
EPISODE EIGHT:
BAKUGO'S START LINE

51
00:04:55.546 --> 00:04:56.880
PERSON-TO-PERSON COMBAT TRAINING
BATTLE ONE. REVIEW

52
00:04:57.047 --> 00:05:01.385
Well. even if I say that.
the MVP for this battle was young Iida!

53
00:05:03.846 --> 00:05:06.598
It's not either of the winners.
Ochaco or Midoriya?

54
00:05:07.266 --> 00:05:11.228
Hmm. well… Why is that?

55
00:05:11.395 --> 00:05:12.396
Does anyone know?

56
00:05:12.855 --> 00:05:14.898
Yes. Mr. All Might.

57
00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:19.528
That is because Iida adapted the most
to the context of the training.

58
00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:23.240
From watching the match.

59
00:05:23.407 --> 00:05:25.993
it appears Bakugo acted on his own
because of an obviously personal grudge.

60
00:05:26.702 --> 00:05:30.080
<i>And as Mr. All Might said earlier.</i>

61
00:05:30.247 --> 00:05:32.374
<i>it is foolish to launch</i>
<i>a large-scale attack indoors.</i>

62
00:05:34.418 --> 00:05:38.505
<i>In the same way. taking into</i>
<i>consideration the damage he received.</i>

63
00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:41.633
<i>Midoriya's plan was also rash.</i>

64
00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:44.094
As for Uraraka…

65
00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:46.263
<i>She let her guard down mid-battle.</i>

66
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.392
<i>and her final attack was too reckless.</i>

67
00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:53.145
If she treated the <i>papier-mâché</i>
as a real weapon.

68
00:05:53.312 --> 00:05:56.023
she would not have been able
to do something so dangerous.

69
00:05:56.565 --> 00:05:58.525
Iida had prepared
for his opponent's arrival

70
00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:01.778
and assumed it would be
a fight over the weapon.

71
00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:04.448
which made him late
in responding to the final attack.

72
00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:08.994
The hero team only won

73
00:06:09.161 --> 00:06:11.496
because they took advantage
of the fact that this was training.

74
00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:13.582
They were practically
breaking the rules.

75
00:06:17.294 --> 00:06:19.546
<i>She said more than I expected…</i>

76
00:06:21.215 --> 00:06:26.720
Well. Young Iida also has parts of him
that could be more relaxed.

77
00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:29.806
but well. that was correct!

78
00:06:30.766 --> 00:06:32.684
We should always start with the
basics to develop depth of learning.

79
00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:34.853
We must strive to devote
ourselves wholeheartedly.

80
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.814
Otherwise. we cannot become top heroes.

81
00:06:38.774 --> 00:06:39.983
<i>Momo Yaoyorozu.</i>

82
00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:42.236
<i>One of four students</i>
<i>admitted to the hero course</i>

83
00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:43.987
<i>based on recommendations.</i>

84
00:06:44.655 --> 00:06:48.242
All right everyone. let's change
locations and start the second match.

85
00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:53.163
Tackle this training after thinking
about what we just talked about.

86
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.665
Yes. sir!

87
00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:56.041
BATTLE BUILDING B

88
00:06:56.208 --> 00:06:57.167
<i>Match two!</i>

89
00:06:57.709 --> 00:07:02.297
<i>Team B are the heroes.</i>
<i>and Team I are the villains!</i>

90
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.882
Ojiro.

91
00:07:04.383 --> 00:07:06.260
I'm going to get serious.

92
00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.136
I'll take off my gloves and boots. too!

93
00:07:08.512 --> 00:07:09.972
Okay…

94
00:07:10.556 --> 00:07:14.226
<i>Hagakure. that's the correct decision</i>
<i>as an invisible person.</i>

95
00:07:14.935 --> 00:07:18.021
<i>but that's not great for a girl.</i>
<i>morally speaking.</i>

96
00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:22.025
-You can't look. okay?
-I can't see you even if I tried.

97
00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:27.531
Now. let's start the second indoor
person-to-person combat training match!

98
00:07:34.413 --> 00:07:37.374
<i>Mezo Shoji.</i>
<i>Quirk: Dupli-Arms.</i>

99
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:41.587
<i>He can create replicas of his own</i>
<i>body parts on the tips of his tentacles.</i>

100
00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:46.133
One in the hall on the north side
of the fourth floor.

101
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.719
The other is somewhere
on the same floor…

102
00:07:48.886 --> 00:07:50.721
They're barefoot…

103
00:07:50.888 --> 00:07:54.057
The invisible one is coming
to ambush and capture us. huh?

104
00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:57.519
Go outside. It's dangerous.

105
00:07:57.686 --> 00:08:00.564
I'm sure our opponents intend
to fight a defensive battle…

106
00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.196
but that does not matter to me.

107
00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:19.958
Ow… My feet!

108
00:08:21.293 --> 00:08:23.670
This Quirk is…

109
00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:35.182
You can move if you want.

110
00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:39.061
but the skin on your feet will come off.
so you won't be able to fight your best.

111
00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:50.489
He did not cause any damage
to his teammate or the nuclear weapon.

112
00:08:50.656 --> 00:08:52.533
and on top of that.
he weakened the enemy.

113
00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:54.493
He's so strong!

114
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.584
<i>Hero team wins!</i>

115
00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:10.676
Heat?

116
00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:15.639
It's hot!

117
00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:19.768
Sorry.

118
00:09:20.644 --> 00:09:22.229
The difference in our ability
was too great.

119
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.189
<i>Shoto Todoroki.</i>

120
00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:26.608
<i>He's another one of the four</i>
<i>admitted to the hero course</i>

121
00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:28.443
<i>based on recommendations.</i>

122
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.404
<i>His Quirk is Half-Cold. Half-Hot.</i>

123
00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:32.322
<i>He freezes with his right</i>
<i>and burns with his left!</i>

124
00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:34.241
<i>The range and temperature</i>
<i>of his ability is unknown?</i>

125
00:09:34.408 --> 00:09:36.118
<i>What is he. a monster?</i>

126
00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:38.036
Wow!

127
00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:39.788
What's up with that Quirk?

128
00:09:40.372 --> 00:09:42.541
As expected of someone
who got in through recommendations.

129
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.295
All right. everyone gather round
for a review of the second match.

130
00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:49.464
Next. we will begin the third match!

131
00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:50.841
Yes. sir!

132
00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:55.804
BATTLE BUILDING C

133
00:10:05.314 --> 00:10:06.315
TEAM J

134
00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:18.577
Ribbit. ribbit.

135
00:10:29.004 --> 00:10:30.130
No. no!

136
00:10:35.052 --> 00:10:36.595
TEAM G

137
00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:47.981
TEAM F

138
00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:57.032
Yahoo!

139
00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:04.748
Sorry. sorry!

140
00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.137
Good work everyone!

141
00:11:19.972 --> 00:11:23.058
We didn't have any major injuries
other than young Midoriya. either!

142
00:11:23.225 --> 00:11:25.227
You guys took this on seriously!

143
00:11:25.394 --> 00:11:28.772
You all did a good job
for your first training!

144
00:11:28.939 --> 00:11:31.859
To have such a proper class
after Mr. Aizawa's class…

145
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:36.697
It's kind of anticlimactic…

146
00:11:37.072 --> 00:11:40.617
We're free to have
proper classes. as well!

147
00:11:40.784 --> 00:11:45.163
Well then. I must review
the results with young Midoriya!

148
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.707
Change and return…

149
00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:49.293
to the classroom!

150
00:11:50.836 --> 00:11:52.796
All Might's amazing!

151
00:11:52.963 --> 00:11:55.716
-Why was he in such a hurry?
-So cool…

152
00:11:58.343 --> 00:12:01.972
<i>Young Bakugo is a mass of pride…</i>

153
00:12:02.139 --> 00:12:05.726
<i>and there's nothing more fragile</i>
<i>than a heart that's swelled to bursting.</i>

154
00:12:05.893 --> 00:12:09.521
<i>As his teacher. I must counsel him well.</i>

155
00:12:10.606 --> 00:12:12.232
<i>But right now…</i>

156
00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:13.650
STAFF ONLY

157
00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:14.985
OPEN - CLOSE

158
00:12:16.528 --> 00:12:18.030
<i>If I teach a class…</i>

159
00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:28.165
<i>I barely have enough time. Shit!</i>

160
00:12:37.382 --> 00:12:40.511
The school year has just begun.
and he's already been in here three times!

161
00:12:41.011 --> 00:12:43.347
Why didn't you stop him. All Might?

162
00:12:44.056 --> 00:12:46.642
I apologize. Recovery Girl.

163
00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:48.977
What are you apologizing to me for?

164
00:12:49.144 --> 00:12:51.396
On top of his total exhaustion.
he was here just yesterday.

165
00:12:52.064 --> 00:12:53.899
I can't treat him all at once.

166
00:12:54.066 --> 00:12:55.609
I did first-aid treatment already.

167
00:12:55.776 --> 00:12:57.444
so after the IV is finished.

168
00:12:57.611 --> 00:13:00.781
we can only wait
for his body to heal slowly overnight.

169
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.160
Jeez. I know he's your favorite
and that you passed on your powers to him.

170
00:13:05.327 --> 00:13:07.412
but doesn't mean you should spoil him!

171
00:13:07.579 --> 00:13:09.790
There is nothing I can say to that.

172
00:13:09.957 --> 00:13:12.209
Because I wanted to consider his feelings.

173
00:13:12.376 --> 00:13:15.671
I hesitated to stop the training match.

174
00:13:15.838 --> 00:13:17.464
Even so…

175
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:21.718
Will you please not talk
about One For All so loudly?

176
00:13:22.553 --> 00:13:27.558
Yes. Mr. Natural-Born Hero.
Mr. Symbol of Peace.

177
00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:32.980
My injury and this form of mine
are common knowledge

178
00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:36.191
among the U.A. teachers
and a certain group of pros.

179
00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:40.237
but the secret of my Quirk. One For All.

180
00:13:40.404 --> 00:13:47.077
is known only to you. the principal.
my close friends. and young Midoriya.

181
00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:52.332
I know it's not like you want
to rest on your laurels at the top.

182
00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:55.961
but is being a "natural-born hero"
or the "Symbol of Peace"

183
00:13:56.128 --> 00:13:58.088
really that important?

184
00:13:58.922 --> 00:14:02.718
If I no longer am. then the superhuman
society will be seized by evil.

185
00:14:03.427 --> 00:14:08.015
This is the responsibility
of those of us with this power.

186
00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:14.646
If that's the case. then it's even
more important for you to learn

187
00:14:14.813 --> 00:14:17.149
what it means to guide someone.

188
00:14:17.316 --> 00:14:18.400
Yes. ma'am.

189
00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:26.116
You can become a hero.

190
00:14:27.159 --> 00:14:30.037
Will you accept my power?

191
00:14:30.579 --> 00:14:33.665
"One For All"…

192
00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:37.419
Smash!

193
00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:43.759
<i>Come. young Midoriya.</i>

194
00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:48.639
<i>This is your hero academia!</i>

195
00:14:49.348 --> 00:14:51.433
<i>I have a lot to learn from here on out</i>

196
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.894
<i>in order to get closer</i>
<i>to what I dream of becoming!</i>

197
00:14:55.979 --> 00:14:59.525
My "Deku" isn't always
going to mean "useless"!

198
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:00.901
Kacchan.

199
00:15:01.068 --> 00:15:05.405
my "Deku" means
"You can do it!"

200
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.844
It's late afternoon?

201
00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:28.220
Are you awake?

202
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.893
<i>That's all for today's treatment.</i>

203
00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.020
<i>Come back again tomorrow. okay?</i>

204
00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:42.234
<i>I ended up</i>
<i>skipping my afternoon classes…</i>

205
00:15:42.401 --> 00:15:45.112
<i>Mr. Aizawa's gonna wrap me</i>
<i>in those bindings again…</i>

206
00:15:50.659 --> 00:15:51.994
Oh. Midoriya's here!

207
00:15:53.036 --> 00:15:54.288
Good work!

208
00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.583
Man. I don't know what you were saying
during the match.

209
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:59.168
but you were fired up!

210
00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:01.503
I can't believe
you fought evenly with Bakugo.

211
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:02.838
who was first in the entrance exam!

212
00:16:03.005 --> 00:16:04.339
You did a good job dodging!

213
00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:06.341
You guys did that in the first match.

214
00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:08.385
so the rest of us
had to give it our all. too.

215
00:16:08.552 --> 00:16:10.137
You were far from elegant. but…

216
00:16:10.304 --> 00:16:11.388
You did a good job dodging!

217
00:16:12.097 --> 00:16:13.015
Huh?

218
00:16:13.724 --> 00:16:15.350
I'm Eijiro Kirishima.

219
00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:18.061
We're all going
over the training together right now.

220
00:16:18.228 --> 00:16:19.688
I'm Hanta Sero.

221
00:16:19.855 --> 00:16:21.106
I'm Yuga Aoya…

222
00:16:21.273 --> 00:16:22.649
I'm Mina Ashido!

223
00:16:22.816 --> 00:16:24.568
You did a good job dodging!

224
00:16:24.735 --> 00:16:27.279
I'm Tsuyu Asui.
Call me Tsu.

225
00:16:27.988 --> 00:16:28.906
I'm Sato!

226
00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:30.616
Um… Er…

227
00:16:30.782 --> 00:16:32.409
I'm Mineta!

228
00:16:32.576 --> 00:16:35.287
-Where the heck did you pop out from?
-I am Yuga Aoyama.

229
00:16:35.454 --> 00:16:37.331
-You did terrible in the training.
-I am a man who never stops shining.

230
00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:38.582
You're too loud.

231
00:16:39.208 --> 00:16:40.501
Tokoyami!

232
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:42.544
That desk is not a chair.

233
00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:44.171
Get off immediately.

234
00:16:44.338 --> 00:16:46.465
-It's not that big a deal. is it?
-Wha…

235
00:16:46.632 --> 00:16:48.759
What's with those hands. anyway?

236
00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.303
You people…

237
00:16:51.887 --> 00:16:54.306
I cannot condone actions
that disrespect the desks

238
00:16:54.473 --> 00:16:57.267
the great men and women
who are our upperclassmen once used!

239
00:16:57.434 --> 00:16:58.810
You're too loud.

240
00:16:59.353 --> 00:17:01.313
<i>Iida never wavers. does he?</i>

241
00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:05.901
Hey. Uraraka.
wanna grab a bite to eat sometime?

242
00:17:06.068 --> 00:17:07.653
What do you like?

243
00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:09.613
Mochi…

244
00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:12.366
Wait. Deku.
she didn't heal your injuries?

245
00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:15.911
Oh. uh. it's because of
how much stamina I have. and…

246
00:17:16.078 --> 00:17:17.162
Huh?

247
00:17:18.747 --> 00:17:22.166
Um. Uraraka. more importantly…

248
00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:25.253
<i>We all tried to stop him.</i>

249
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.756
<i>but he went home just now</i>
<i>without saying anything.</i>

250
00:17:29.132 --> 00:17:32.719
<i>Hey! You tricked me. didn't you?</i>

251
00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:35.472
<i>Was it fun tricking me all this time?</i>

252
00:17:36.223 --> 00:17:38.976
<i>You've got a flashy Quirk there.</i>
<i>don't you?</i>

253
00:17:47.109 --> 00:17:48.318
Kacchan!

254
00:17:50.571 --> 00:17:51.738
Kacchan!

255
00:17:54.449 --> 00:17:55.367
What?

256
00:18:00.664 --> 00:18:04.626
<i>It's a secret I didn't even tell my mom…</i>

257
00:18:04.793 --> 00:18:06.128
<i>But…</i>

258
00:18:08.297 --> 00:18:12.759
There's one thing
I feel like I have to tell you.

259
00:18:15.179 --> 00:18:19.558
My Quirk is something
I received from someone else.

260
00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:20.809
Huh?

261
00:18:20.976 --> 00:18:23.061
I can't say who I got it from. though!

262
00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:24.938
I won't say…

263
00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:28.942
But it's like a story
out of comic books. except it's true.

264
00:18:29.735 --> 00:18:32.988
On top of that.
I still can't control it properly.

265
00:18:33.155 --> 00:18:37.451
It's just a borrowed power
that I haven't made my own yet.

266
00:18:37.618 --> 00:18:38.785
That's why…

267
00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.122
I tried to beat you without using it.

268
00:18:42.289 --> 00:18:46.126
But in the end.
I couldn't win and had to rely on it.

269
00:18:47.711 --> 00:18:49.546
I've still got a long way to go…

270
00:18:49.713 --> 00:18:50.672
That's why…

271
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:52.925
That's why…

272
00:18:54.551 --> 00:18:59.848
One day. I will make this Quirk my own

273
00:19:00.891 --> 00:19:03.602
and beat you with my own power!

274
00:19:07.648 --> 00:19:09.816
<i>I just came to tell him</i>
<i>I didn't trick him.</i>

275
00:19:09.983 --> 00:19:11.401
<i>What am I…</i>

276
00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:14.821
What the hell is that?

277
00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:16.740
"Borrowed power"?

278
00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:18.825
You're talking nonsense.

279
00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:21.703
What are you trying to do.

280
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:25.332
make me out to be more of a fool
than you already have? Huh?

281
00:19:26.333 --> 00:19:28.544
What are you trying to say?

282
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.672
Today. I lost to you…

283
00:19:32.297 --> 00:19:33.882
That's all it was…

284
00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:36.593
That's all!

285
00:19:38.887 --> 00:19:40.472
<i>As I watched the ice guy.</i>

286
00:19:41.515 --> 00:19:44.017
I thought. "I can't beat him"!

287
00:19:44.768 --> 00:19:47.396
It is foolish to launch
a large-scale attack indoors.

288
00:19:47.771 --> 00:19:52.818
Damn it! I ended up agreeing
with what that ponytail girl said!

289
00:19:53.318 --> 00:19:56.280
Damn it!

290
00:19:57.489 --> 00:20:00.659
Hey. you too. Deku!

291
00:20:01.535 --> 00:20:03.120
I'm just…

292
00:20:03.287 --> 00:20:05.330
I'm just getting started!

293
00:20:05.497 --> 00:20:06.540
You hear?

294
00:20:06.707 --> 00:20:09.668
Here. I will become number one!

295
00:20:15.674 --> 00:20:19.052
You won't beat me again. bastard!

296
00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:27.144
There he is!

297
00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:29.021
Young…

298
00:20:29.188 --> 00:20:31.023
Bakugo!

299
00:20:34.276 --> 00:20:37.487
Just so you know. pride is important.

300
00:20:38.363 --> 00:20:42.159
You definitely have the abilities
needed to become a pro.

301
00:20:42.326 --> 00:20:44.036
You still have a lot of…

302
00:20:44.203 --> 00:20:45.871
Let go of me. All Might.

303
00:20:46.038 --> 00:20:47.581
I can't walk.

304
00:20:49.208 --> 00:20:54.254
I'll become a hero that surpasses
even you without you telling me!

305
00:20:54.421 --> 00:20:55.923
Huh?

306
00:20:56.673 --> 00:20:58.926
Uh. right.

307
00:20:59.927 --> 00:21:01.887
<i>He's gotten over it…</i>

308
00:21:05.516 --> 00:21:08.268
<i>It's hard being a teacher…</i>

309
00:21:10.312 --> 00:21:12.105
What was that?

310
00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:14.233
The fated battle between men.

311
00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:18.946
It looked like Midoriya was just
giving excuses one-sidedly. though.

312
00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:21.281
The fated battle between men!

313
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:26.161
<i>Kacchan's fuse has been lit.</i>

314
00:21:26.662 --> 00:21:28.747
<i>That doesn't change what I have to do.</i>

315
00:21:28.914 --> 00:21:31.166
<i>I just have to chase after him.</i>

316
00:21:32.668 --> 00:21:33.836
Young Midoriya!

317
00:21:34.211 --> 00:21:37.214
What were you talking about
with young Bakugo?

318
00:21:37.381 --> 00:21:39.091
Um. we were. uh…

319
00:21:39.258 --> 00:21:41.176
Hmm… I'm so curious.

320
00:21:41.802 --> 00:21:44.179
Why don't you tell me in detail?

321
00:21:44.346 --> 00:21:46.515
Um. actually…

322
00:23:23.946 --> 00:23:27.616
<i>A few days later. we would find out…</i>

323
00:23:27.783 --> 00:23:29.117
KARAOKE

324
00:23:30.536 --> 00:23:35.707
<i>…how terrifying the truly cunning villains</i>
<i>All Might warned us about were.</i>

325
00:23:36.708 --> 00:23:38.126
ALL MIGHT BECOMES U.A. TEACHER!
CLOSES AGENCY TEMPORARILY

326
00:23:38.293 --> 00:23:39.545
Did you see this?

327
00:23:40.087 --> 00:23:41.964
It says he's a teacher…

328
00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.884
Hey.

329
00:23:46.927 --> 00:23:49.179
What do you think'll happen…

330
00:23:50.264 --> 00:23:52.641
if the Symbol of Peace…

331
00:23:57.145 --> 00:23:59.398
is killed by villains?

332
00:24:01.108 --> 00:24:01.984
NEXT TIME

333
00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:04.069
<i>All heroes have their starting point!</i>

334
00:24:04.236 --> 00:24:06.280
<i>Next time.</i>
<i>"Yeah. Just Do Your Best. Iida!"</i>

335
00:24:06.446 --> 00:24:09.533
<i>A lot of stuff happens and young Midoriya</i>
<i>gets swept away in the crowd!</i>

336
00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:10.701
<i>Look forward to it!</i>

337
00:24:11.285 --> 00:24:13.203
<i>Go beyond!</i>

338
00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:14.913
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>

339
00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:15.956
NEXT TIME:
YEAH. JUST DO YOUR BEST. IIDA!
