1
00:00:03.836 --> 00:00:06.882
<i>The number one hero. All Might.</i>

2
00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.843
<i>Age unknown. Quirk unidentified.</i>

3
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.137
<i>He dashed onto the scene</i>
<i>of the hero world</i>

4
00:00:12.304 --> 00:00:14.556
<i>and received unwavering</i>
<i>popularity based on his ability.</i>

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.809
<i>Ever since he appeared.</i>

6
00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:20.354
<i>the once critically high rate of crimes</i>
<i>committed by villains</i>

7
00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:21.855
<i>decreased year after year.</i>

8
00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:24.650
<i>and his existence itself</i>
<i>became a deterrent.</i>

9
00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:29.530
<i>He became the Symbol of Peace</i>
<i>in both name and reality.</i>

10
00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:33.158
<i>And that man said to me…</i>

11
00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:37.162
<i>You can become a hero.</i>

12
00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.999
<i>-Huh? Midoriya? No way!</i>
<i>-You're Quirkless!</i>

13
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.877
<i>How can you even stand</i>
<i>in the same ring as me?</i>

14
00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:46.547
<i>-You should probably give it up.</i>
<i>-I'm sorry. Izuku!</i>

15
00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:49.258
<i>I wanted someone to tell me that.</i>

16
00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:54.012
<i>And then. the person I most admired</i>
<i>said those words to me.</i>

17
00:00:54.847 --> 00:00:58.725
<i>Can anything</i>
<i>be more shocking than this?</i>

18
00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:00.727
<i>More than this?</i>

19
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.983
You are worthy to inherit my power.

20
00:02:43.914 --> 00:02:46.708
Inherit your power?

21
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.629
What's with that face?

22
00:02:50.796 --> 00:02:53.131
It's just a suggestion.
The real show starts after this.

23
00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:58.512
Listen. young man. You need to decide

24
00:02:58.971 --> 00:03:01.807
whether or not
you will accept my power!

25
00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:06.687
<i>What is All Might saying?</i>

26
00:03:08.272 --> 00:03:11.316
I'm talking about my power.
young man.

27
00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:15.946
<i>The tabloids called it</i>
<i>"superhuman strength" and a "boost."</i>

28
00:03:16.697 --> 00:03:20.868
<i>and I constantly dodged the question</i>
<i>during interviews with a funny joke.</i>

29
00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:26.874
Because the Symbol of Peace.
All Might. had to be a natural-born hero.

30
00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:32.045
But young man. I will tell you the truth.

31
00:03:35.132 --> 00:03:39.178
My Quirk was passed on
to me like a sacred torch.

32
00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:43.182
It was passed on to you?

33
00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:48.020
That's right.
And next. it is your turn.

34
00:03:48.187 --> 00:03:50.480
Wait! Wait a minute!

35
00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:52.983
<i>It's true that your Quirk</i>
<i>is something hotly debated</i>

36
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.152
<i>as one of the world's greatest mysteries.</i>

37
00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:56.987
<i>So much so that not a day goes by</i>

38
00:03:57.154 --> 00:03:59.156
<i>when I don't see someone</i>
<i>talking about it online.</i>

39
00:03:59.323 --> 00:04:01.241
But. well. I don't really understand

40
00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:03.160
what you mean
by inheriting or passing on a Quirk…

41
00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:05.787
I've never heard
of anything like that before.

42
00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:07.664
and it's never even been
conjectured in the debate.

43
00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:11.376
Why is that? Is it because
since the dawn of history.

44
00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:13.128
a Quirk like that was never confirmed?

45
00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:15.714
In the first place. it's…

46
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:18.257
You always start with denial. huh?

47
00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.135
Nonsense!

48
00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:24.681
I may hide a lot of things.
but I don't lie!

49
00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:26.975
The power to transfer power…

50
00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:29.228
That is the Quirk I inherited!

51
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.192
I was crowned with "One For All"!

52
00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:39.071
"One For All"…

53
00:04:39.238 --> 00:04:40.531
That's right.

54
00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.243
<i>One person cultivates the power</i>

55
00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.995
<i>and passes it on to another person.</i>

56
00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:49.248
<i>who also cultivates it</i>
<i>and passes it on.</i>

57
00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:53.460
It is the crystallization of power

58
00:04:53.627 --> 00:04:56.296
that spins together
the voices of those who need help

59
00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:58.006
with a courageous heart.

60
00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:04.263
Why are you giving me
something so great?

61
00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:07.182
I have been looking for a successor.

62
00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:11.645
And then. I thought it would be
all right for you to inherit it.

63
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.899
<i>You are just a Quirkless hero fanboy.</i>

64
00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:19.528
<i>but you were more heroic</i>
<i>than anyone else back there!</i>

65
00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:29.121
Never mind!
Well. it's up to you. though.

66
00:05:29.538 --> 00:05:30.497
What'll you do?

67
00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:37.004
<i>He said so much to encourage me.</i>
<i>and even told me his secret…</i>

68
00:05:38.255 --> 00:05:40.674
<i>Is there… Of course there isn't…</i>

69
00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:44.261
<i>There's no reason</i>
<i>for me to turn him down!</i>

70
00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:48.473
I'll do it!

71
00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.352
An immediate reply.
That's what I thought you'd say!

72
00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:59.193
<i>But it was no easy task</i>
<i>to receive his power.</i>

73
00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:04.239
EPISODE THREE:
ROARING MUSCLES

74
00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:06.491
DAGOBA MUNICIPAL BEACH PARK

75
00:06:06.992 --> 00:06:09.494
TWO DAYS LATER - EARLY MORNING

76
00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:16.210
Hey! This is such a comfy fridge
to sit on!

77
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:23.217
If you could move it even a little.
it would be a little easier.

78
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:28.764
Well yeah. I mean.
you weigh 274 kilograms. right?

79
00:06:28.931 --> 00:06:31.934
No. I lost weight.
so I'm only 255 kilograms now.

80
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.227
in this form.

81
00:06:35.354 --> 00:06:40.067
Anyway. why am I dragging trash
at the beach park?

82
00:06:41.777 --> 00:06:44.488
It's 'cause. you know.
you're not a proper vessel.

83
00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:48.659
What you're saying now is the opposite
of what you said before!

84
00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:50.661
I'm talking about your body.

85
00:06:53.622 --> 00:06:56.333
My Quirk. One For All.

86
00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.004
is the fullest physical ability
of many people gathered into one.

87
00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:04.174
An unprepared body
cannot inherit it fully.

88
00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:07.427
<i>The limbs will come off</i>
<i>and the body will explode.</i>

89
00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:08.470
The limbs will what?

90
00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:15.352
Then… I'm picking up trash
in order to train my body?

91
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.312
Yes!

92
00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:18.772
But that's not all.

93
00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:21.149
After some research
on the internet yesterday.

94
00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:24.194
I discovered
that part of this beach park's coast

95
00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:26.488
has been like this for many years.

96
00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:29.992
Yeah…

97
00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:33.996
For some reason. because of the currents.
objects drift here a lot.

98
00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:37.833
and people take advantage of that
to hide their illegal dumping.

99
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.960
The local residents
don't come near here. either.

100
00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:44.298
Heroes these days
are all after the showy stuff.

101
00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:47.301
Originally. being a hero
meant doing volunteer service.

102
00:07:48.135 --> 00:07:50.762
Even if people
called that boring or whatever.

103
00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:53.140
You can't waver from those roots.

104
00:07:54.558 --> 00:07:57.936
You will restore the horizon
for this whole section!

105
00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:01.940
That is your first step
toward becoming a hero!

106
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:05.819
My first step?

107
00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:08.822
Clean… this…

108
00:08:09.907 --> 00:08:11.158
All of it?

109
00:08:11.992 --> 00:08:14.494
Young Midoriya.
you want to go to U.A.. right?

110
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:16.246
Yes!

111
00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:18.999
Because it's where you went!

112
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.463
So if I'm going to go. I thought
it would definitely have to be U.A.

113
00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.924
You're a go-getter fanboy!

114
00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:29.760
But I've told you this before.

115
00:08:29.927 --> 00:08:33.013
It's not something
you can do without a Quirk.

116
00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.307
It's sad.
but that is what the reality is.

117
00:08:36.183 --> 00:08:38.936
And U.A.'s is the hardest
hero course to get into.

118
00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:40.645
In other words…

119
00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:42.940
In the ten months
until U.A.'s entrance exam.

120
00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:44.816
I have to complete my vessel!

121
00:08:45.609 --> 00:08:47.027
That's where this comes in!

122
00:08:47.194 --> 00:08:50.822
I came up with this:
"Aim to Pass: American Dream Plan"!

123
00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:56.119
It's a training plan to help
you finish cleaning up the beach.

124
00:08:56.286 --> 00:08:58.580
I'll have you follow this
in every aspect of your life!

125
00:08:59.748 --> 00:09:01.333
Even sleep time is included…

126
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.795
Frankly. this is a super hard schedule.
Can you follow it?

127
00:09:06.505 --> 00:09:11.093
Of course. I have to work
many times harder than anyone else.

128
00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.511
or else I can't do it!

129
00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:17.641
<i>And so began my ten months of hell.</i>

130
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:22.688
Carry that to the park entrance!

131
00:09:22.855 --> 00:09:24.022
Put it in the truck!

132
00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:28.068
<i>Depending on size and shape. the muscles</i>
<i>I have to use are completely different!</i>

133
00:09:28.235 --> 00:09:29.862
I see. This is…

134
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.365
Run! Ten months will be over
before you know it!

135
00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:36.994
Let's become athletic!

136
00:09:38.871 --> 00:09:41.039
Let's see…
With the appearance of superpowers.

137
00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:43.375
the Building Standards Act
was revised…

138
00:09:43.542 --> 00:09:44.668
<i>This is tough…</i>

139
00:09:44.835 --> 00:09:46.253
<i>Ten months of this. huh?</i>

140
00:09:47.171 --> 00:09:50.340
<i>It'll be hard if I don't finish</i>
<i>by a week before the exam.</i>

141
00:09:50.841 --> 00:09:54.011
<i>Which means. there are 294 days left.</i>

142
00:09:54.178 --> 00:09:56.471
<i>Taking into consideration</i>
<i>a sufficient recovery period</i>

143
00:09:56.638 --> 00:09:59.349
<i>if I rest for two days in between.</i>
<i>that gives me…</i>

144
00:10:00.058 --> 00:10:04.021
…about 98 days of real training
even if I'm efficient.

145
00:10:04.188 --> 00:10:07.065
I can get in about five hours
of training morning and night.

146
00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:09.484
so that's 490 hours.

147
00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:12.946
Also. that beach cleanup doesn't work out
any specific parts of the body.

148
00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:16.992
If I don't work out my whole body equally.
then there's no way I'll make it.

149
00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:19.286
Bodybuilding to create a body
able to adapt to any situation…

150
00:10:19.453 --> 00:10:21.371
Literally intensive training
to become a hero…

151
00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:23.790
All Might can't stay
and watch me the whole time.

152
00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:26.043
If I don't do as much efficient
independent training as I can.

153
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:27.836
there's no way I can catch up
the way I am now…

154
00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:29.463
-Midoriya. hey!
-Anyway. I'll have to cut…

155
00:10:31.507 --> 00:10:34.593
Did your encounter with the villain
make you go crazy?

156
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.847
It's presumptuous to think
of getting into U.A. like that.

157
00:10:39.014 --> 00:10:40.849
Plus. I have to study
for the entrance exam.

158
00:10:41.225 --> 00:10:42.643
A nervous breakdown already?

159
00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:44.144
That's scary.

160
00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:15.819
Hey. what's wrong?

161
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.155
There are only three months left!

162
00:12:18.322 --> 00:12:19.615
You won't make it!

163
00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:23.619
Wanna give up?
Wanna take it easy and rest today?

164
00:12:29.208 --> 00:12:30.626
Overwork?

165
00:12:32.044 --> 00:12:36.048
The "Aim to Pass: American Dream Plan"
was adjusted with your body in mind

166
00:12:36.215 --> 00:12:39.259
to make sure you'd make it
in time for the entrance exam.

167
00:12:40.928 --> 00:12:43.013
You haven't been
sticking to the plan. have you?

168
00:12:43.764 --> 00:12:45.641
Overdoing it
will have the opposite effect!

169
00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:47.518
Don't you want to get in?

170
00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:49.520
I do…

171
00:12:50.604 --> 00:12:53.190
But I can't just get in…

172
00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:58.070
I have to work
a lot more than other people

173
00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:01.490
or I won't be able to catch up.

174
00:13:04.201 --> 00:13:07.454
I want to be like you.

175
00:13:08.205 --> 00:13:11.667
I want to become
the greatest hero. like you!

176
00:13:13.836 --> 00:13:16.255
Saving people with a fearless smile.

177
00:13:16.839 --> 00:13:18.423
Like you!

178
00:13:20.926 --> 00:13:24.304
<i>He's looking far into the future. huh?</i>

179
00:13:26.056 --> 00:13:28.684
You go-getter fanboy!

180
00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:32.187
I like that!

181
00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:35.816
But if that's the case.
then you really can't rush things now.

182
00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:38.318
But I understand your feelings.

183
00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:41.321
Leave it to this old guy
to adjust your plan!

184
00:13:41.488 --> 00:13:44.741
You're not old… All Might…

185
00:13:50.289 --> 00:13:51.206
FEBRUARY 26

186
00:13:51.373 --> 00:13:54.001
<i>And then. it was 6 a.m.</i>
<i>on the day of the entrance exam.</i>

187
00:14:12.978 --> 00:14:14.229
Hey. hey…

188
00:14:15.147 --> 00:14:18.525
He even cleaned outside
of where I told him to! Seriously?

189
00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:21.904
There's not even a speck of dust left!
Seriously?

190
00:14:24.823 --> 00:14:29.369
He finished at the last minute!
More than perfectly!

191
00:14:30.037 --> 00:14:32.289
Oh my…

192
00:14:32.456 --> 00:14:33.749
goodness!

193
00:14:41.215 --> 00:14:42.466
Good work.

194
00:14:43.967 --> 00:14:48.472
All Might… I did it.

195
00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:49.890
I did it!

196
00:14:50.474 --> 00:14:54.686
Yeah. you surprised me.
you entertainer!

197
00:14:54.853 --> 00:14:57.231
Teenagers are amazing!

198
00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.858
Here. take a look.

199
00:15:02.027 --> 00:15:05.113
-This is…
-It's you. ten months ago.

200
00:15:07.658 --> 00:15:10.661
You did good. You really did!

201
00:15:11.954 --> 00:15:15.165
The mirage of
it is finally just barely visible.

202
00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:18.752
but you have certainly become
a suitable vessel!

203
00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:25.425
I feel like I'm cheating…

204
00:15:27.678 --> 00:15:30.180
You did all this for me…

205
00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:33.350
I'm too blessed…

206
00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:39.481
<i>What're you saying after all this time…</i>
<i>It was your own hard work.</i>

207
00:15:40.858 --> 00:15:43.151
We'll have to fix
those leaky eyes of yours.

208
00:15:43.569 --> 00:15:47.030
Now. it's time for the award ceremony.
Izuku Midoriya!

209
00:15:47.197 --> 00:15:48.282
Yes. sir!

210
00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:52.369
This is something I was once told:

211
00:15:52.536 --> 00:15:54.872
"Something that you
receive because you're lucky

212
00:15:55.038 --> 00:15:57.332
"and something that you are given
because you are recognized

213
00:15:57.499 --> 00:15:58.709
"are different in essence."

214
00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:02.713
Take that to heart.

215
00:16:03.505 --> 00:16:07.050
This is power that you earned
because of your own effort.

216
00:16:12.431 --> 00:16:16.435
<i>I took the reality that would be</i>
<i>surprising even in comics</i>

217
00:16:17.644 --> 00:16:19.146
<i>in my hand…</i>

218
00:16:20.272 --> 00:16:21.148
Eat this.

219
00:16:22.232 --> 00:16:23.358
Huh?

220
00:16:23.942 --> 00:16:27.654
It doesn't really matter what it is
as long as you take in my DNA.

221
00:16:27.821 --> 00:16:30.157
It's too different from what I imagined!

222
00:16:30.324 --> 00:16:31.825
Now. there's no time!

223
00:16:31.992 --> 00:16:33.577
You'll be late for the exam!

224
00:16:33.744 --> 00:16:36.121
Come!

225
00:16:46.632 --> 00:16:49.968

U.A. HIGH SCHOOL

227
00:16:58.852 --> 00:17:00.229
I made it.

228
00:17:04.608 --> 00:17:05.733
<i>In the end.</i>

229
00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:09.195
<i>I didn't have time to test out</i>
<i>the power I received from All Might.</i>

230
00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:11.698
Eat this.

231
00:17:13.116 --> 00:17:16.954
I swallowed the hair.
but did I really receive his power?

232
00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:18.454
Outta my way. Deku!

233
00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.290
Kacchan!

234
00:17:21.458 --> 00:17:23.794
Don't stand in front of me. I'll kill you.

235
00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:27.964
Morning. Let's both do our best…

236
00:17:31.134 --> 00:17:34.346
Hey. isn't that Bakugo?
The one with the sludge villain?

237
00:17:34.513 --> 00:17:35.681
Oh. he's the real thing!

238
00:17:36.849 --> 00:17:40.686
<i>Ever since that day.</i>
<i>Kacchan didn't do anything to me.</i>

239
00:17:42.688 --> 00:17:45.440
<i>I was just scared of him out of habit!</i>

240
00:17:47.693 --> 00:17:49.361
<i>I'm different from before!</i>

241
00:17:50.529 --> 00:17:53.657
<i>Remember these past ten months!</i>

242
00:17:54.366 --> 00:17:55.450
<i>Take the first step…</i>

243
00:17:56.952 --> 00:17:59.288
<i>to being a hero!</i>

244
00:18:01.415 --> 00:18:02.833
<i>This is it!</i>

245
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.130
Are you all right?

246
00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:17.848
It's my Quirk. Sorry for using it
without asking first.

247
00:18:18.015 --> 00:18:21.476
But it'd be bad luck if you fell. right?

248
00:18:22.102 --> 00:18:24.021
Aren't you nervous?

249
00:18:24.897 --> 00:18:26.064
Uh…

250
00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:28.859
Let's do our best. See ya!

251
00:18:33.447 --> 00:18:35.532
<i>I talked to a girl!</i>

252
00:18:35.866 --> 00:18:37.618
DIDN'T ACTUALLY TALK

U.A. HIGH SCHOOL HERO COURSE
EXAM ORIENTATION

254
00:18:49.838 --> 00:18:51.882
For all you examinee listeners tuning in.

255
00:18:52.049 --> 00:18:54.593
welcome to my show today!

256
00:18:55.469 --> 00:18:57.221
Everybody say "hey"!

257
00:18:58.388 --> 00:19:00.599
SILENCE!!

258
00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.519
What a refined response.

259
00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:08.732
Then I'll quickly present to you
the rundown on the practical exam!

260
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.193
Are you ready?

261
00:19:12.027 --> 00:19:13.445
Yeah!

262
00:19:13.612 --> 00:19:15.697
SILENCE!!

263
00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:19.451
It's the Voice Hero.
Present Mic! Wow!

264
00:19:20.202 --> 00:19:22.788
I listen to him every week on the radio.
I'm so moved!

265
00:19:22.955 --> 00:19:25.707
-All the teachers at U.A. are pro heroes!
-Shut up.

266
00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:27.835
As it says
in the application requirements.

267
00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:33.048
you listeners will be conducting
ten-minute mock urban battles after this!

268
00:19:34.383 --> 00:19:35.801
You can bring whatever you want with you.

269
00:19:35.968 --> 00:19:39.555
After the presentation. you'll head
to the specified battle center. okay?

270
00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:41.473
SILENCE!!

271
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.975
Okay?

272
00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:46.562
In other words. they won't let you
work with your friends. huh?

273
00:19:46.728 --> 00:19:47.771
EXAMINEE NUMBER: 2234
TEST LOCATION: BATTLE CENTER B

274
00:19:47.938 --> 00:19:50.732
You're right. Even though
our examinee numbers are consecutive.

275
00:19:50.899 --> 00:19:52.860
we're assigned
to different battle centers.

276
00:19:53.527 --> 00:19:55.362
Don't look. I'll kill you.

277
00:19:56.738 --> 00:19:58.824
Damn. now I can't crush you.

278
00:20:00.784 --> 00:20:05.247
Three different types of faux villains
are stationed in each battle center.

279
00:20:05.414 --> 00:20:08.917
You earn points for each of them
based on their level of difficulty.

280
00:20:09.626 --> 00:20:11.420
<i>Your goal. dear listeners.</i>
<i>is to use your Quirks</i>

281
00:20:11.587 --> 00:20:16.133
<i>to earn points by immobilizing</i>
<i>the faux villains.</i>

282
00:20:16.508 --> 00:20:19.178
Of course. attacking other examinees

283
00:20:19.344 --> 00:20:21.847
and any other unheroic actions
are prohibited!

284
00:20:22.973 --> 00:20:24.600
May I ask a question?

285
00:20:24.766 --> 00:20:25.976
Okay!

286
00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:30.522
On the printout.
there are four types of villains.

287
00:20:31.356 --> 00:20:34.860
If that is a misprint. then U.A..
the most prominent school in Japan.

288
00:20:35.027 --> 00:20:36.486
should be ashamed
of that foolish mistake.

289
00:20:36.653 --> 00:20:40.324
We examinees are here in this place

290
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.410
because we wish to be molded
into exemplary heroes.

291
00:20:43.577 --> 00:20:46.622
In addition. you over there
with the curly hair.

292
00:20:46.788 --> 00:20:48.957
You've been muttering
this whole time.

293
00:20:49.124 --> 00:20:50.459
It's distracting!

294
00:20:50.626 --> 00:20:54.004
If you're here on a pleasure trip.
then you should leave immediately!

295
00:20:54.838 --> 00:20:56.131
I'm sorry…

296
00:20:57.341 --> 00:21:01.386
Okay. examinee number 7111.

297
00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:04.139
Thanks for the great message.

298
00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:07.392
The fourth type of villain
is worth zero points.

299
00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:09.937
That guy's an obstacle. so to speak.

300
00:21:10.312 --> 00:21:11.563
<i>There's one in every battle center.</i>

301
00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:14.942
<i>An obstacle that will go crazy</i>
<i>in narrow spaces.</i>

302
00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:18.529
<i>It's not impossible to defeat. but</i>
<i>there's no reason to defeat it. either.</i>

303
00:21:18.695 --> 00:21:22.282
I recommend
that you listeners try to avoid it.

304
00:21:23.325 --> 00:21:24.535
Thank you very much!

305
00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:25.953
Please excuse the interruption!

306
00:21:28.539 --> 00:21:31.750
I see… It's like the obstacles
you avoid in videos games. huh?

307
00:21:31.917 --> 00:21:33.502
The whole thing is like a video game.

308
00:21:34.336 --> 00:21:35.879
That's all from me!

309
00:21:36.046 --> 00:21:40.384
Finally. I'll give you listeners
a present: our school motto!

310
00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:44.638
The hero Napoleon Bonaparte once said:

311
00:21:45.806 --> 00:21:51.270
"A true hero is someone
who overcomes life's misfortunes."

312
00:21:52.104 --> 00:21:53.856
Go beyond.

313
00:21:55.482 --> 00:21:56.900
Plus Ultra!

314
00:22:00.779 --> 00:22:03.407
Now. everyone. good luck suffering!
