00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:05.714
<i>Kill the Symbol of Peace.</i>

2
00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.594
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>
<i>We are the League of Villains.</i>

3
00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:12.971
<i>It may be presumptuous of us.</i>

4
00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:15.140
<i>but we have invited ourselves in</i>

5
00:00:15.307 --> 00:00:17.684
<i>to the home of the heroes.</i>
<i>U.A. High School.</i>

6
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:22.147
<i>in order to have All Might.</i>
<i>the Symbol of Peace. take his last breath.</i>

7
00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:28.570
Everyone!

8
00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.697
<i>Idiot. he's Eraser Head!</i>

9
00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:33.825
<i>He can erase Quirks</i>
<i>just by looking at them!</i>

10
00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:36.411
-<i>Class rep!</i>
-Yes?

11
00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:38.288
<i>I entrust this duty to you.</i>

12
00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:40.958
<i>Run to the school and tell them</i>
<i>about what is happening here.</i>

13
00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:44.711
But it would be a disgrace as class rep
to leave everyone behind…

14
00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:47.130
<i>Use your Quirk</i>
<i>in order to save others!</i>

15
00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:55.556
<i>Black Hole!</i>

16
00:00:57.516 --> 00:00:59.518
What do you mean. fight?
Are you stupid?

17
00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:03.021
This is the only way…

18
00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:04.897
to win!

19
00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:09.611
Delaware Smash!

20
00:01:19.997 --> 00:01:21.707
Even I…

21
00:01:21.874 --> 00:01:24.293
Even I can…

22
00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:28.755
-Move!
-Get away!

23
00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:29.965
-You too!
-You're in my way!

24
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.304
I guess it's like we've cleared

25
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.389
the first hurdle.

26
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.476
<i>You're both amazing!</i>

27
00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:17.072
Bastard. get off!

28
00:03:18.657 --> 00:03:22.452
I had a bowel movement this morning.
so those things'll stick all day.

29
00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:24.830
We were lucky that was all of them.

30
00:03:24.997 --> 00:03:26.999
I took a huge gamble.

31
00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:30.210
Normally. they would've kept
some people underwater in reserve.

32
00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:33.463
-I was trying to keep my composure…
-Midoriya. stop that. It's scary.

33
00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:38.552
Rather than reflecting back.
shouldn't you think about what to do next?

34
00:03:39.303 --> 00:03:40.804
You're right.

35
00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:43.307
Are you all right?

36
00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.809
Yeah.

37
00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:49.021
Anyway. we should make
getting help our top priority.

38
00:03:49.188 --> 00:03:50.856
It would be best to follow the shore

39
00:03:51.023 --> 00:03:53.817
and avoid the central plaza
as we head toward the exit.

40
00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:55.485
That's true.

41
00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:59.489
Mr. Aizawa has drawn
a large number of villains to the plaza.

42
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.911
<i>But there are too many villains.</i>

43
00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:07.748
<i>Of course. Mr. Aizawa</i>
<i>is trying to suppress them…</i>

44
00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:13.420
…but I think he overexerted himself

45
00:04:13.587 --> 00:04:16.923
by jumping into that crowd of villains
to protect us.

46
00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:20.219
Wait. Midoriya. don't tell me you…

47
00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.429
Stupid!

48
00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:25.807
I'm not thinking of doing anything
that'll get in his way.

49
00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:27.434
But if we can just find an opening

50
00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:29.686
and lessen Mr. Aizawa's load.
even a little…

51
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.691
<i>We had our first win in our first battle.</i>
<i>That was where we were mistaken.</i>

52
00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:38.654
<i>We were under the illusion</i>
<i>that our powers</i>

53
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.948
<i>could actually work</i>
<i>against the enemy.</i>

54
00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:44.952
EPISODE 11: GAME OVER

55
00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:46.453
LANDSLIDE ZONE

56
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.956
"Scatter you and kill you." huh?

57
00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:52.209
I hate to say this.

58
00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:57.506
but you just look like guys with Quirks
they didn't know what to do with.

59
00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:02.678
This guy… The instant we warped here…

60
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.013
Is he really a kid?

61
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.849
Ow…

62
00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:10.853
<i>Where is he?</i>

63
00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:14.606
I went through the trouble
of bringing this whole crowd. too…

64
00:05:15.232 --> 00:05:16.859
<i>Killing All Might…</i>

65
00:05:17.526 --> 00:05:19.236
<i>At first glance. I thought</i>
<i>they had gathered all their elite</i>

66
00:05:19.403 --> 00:05:21.655
<i>and would overpower him by numbers.</i>

67
00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:30.038
<i>But a closer look shows that</i>
<i>the pawns they prepared for us</i>

68
00:05:30.706 --> 00:05:33.458
<i>were just a ragtag bunch of thugs.</i>

69
00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:42.176
<i>From what I saw. there were only</i>
<i>four or five truly dangerous people.</i>

70
00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:47.055
<i>If that's the case.</i>
<i>then the next step I should take is…</i>

71
00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:54.146
Hey. at this rate.
your cells will slowly die.

72
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.983
I want to be a hero.

73
00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.944
I would like to avoid
something so cruel if possible.

74
00:06:03.739 --> 00:06:07.117
On what basis do you think
you can kill All Might?

75
00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:09.203
What's your plan?

76
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.039
MOUNTAIN ZONE

77
00:06:15.167 --> 00:06:16.793
Scary! Seriously.
did you see that just now?

78
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.003
I saw the River Styx. seriously!

79
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.131
What the heck is up with these guys?
What's going on?

80
00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:23.133
Worry about that later.

81
00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:26.345
Right now. we need to figure out
how we'll get away from all these people.

82
00:06:26.762 --> 00:06:28.388
Then give me a weapon. too!

83
00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:30.098
You're the electric guy. aren't you?

84
00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:31.558
Hurry up and take care of them!

85
00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:32.601
You saw.

86
00:06:32.768 --> 00:06:33.852
during the combat training.
didn't you?

87
00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:34.895
<i>We were paired up!</i>

88
00:06:35.312 --> 00:06:37.105
I can only cover myself with electricity!

89
00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:39.149
I can discharge electricity.
but it's not like I can control it!

90
00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:41.151
I'll hit you two. too!

91
00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:43.028
It's like. you know.
the same as Todoroki!

92
00:06:43.487 --> 00:06:44.655
Even if we wanted to call for help.

93
00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:47.074
there's interference jamming the signal.

94
00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:48.116
Listen. you two.

95
00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:51.828
Right now. you can't count on me.
I'm counting on you!

96
00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:54.039
You're a guy. aren't you? Stop whining.

97
00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:58.168
Then. I'll use you as a human stun gun!

98
00:06:58.502 --> 00:06:59.545
Seriously? Idiot…

99
00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:02.756
Oh. it's working.

100
00:07:02.923 --> 00:07:04.091
I'm strong.

101
00:07:04.258 --> 00:07:07.678
-You two can count on me!
-Hey. you're too happy-go-lucky.

102
00:07:09.096 --> 00:07:10.639
Stop messing around. kid!

103
00:07:23.694 --> 00:07:25.571
Both of you should take this
more seriously.

104
00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:28.824
Sorry. I thought
it was a good idea at the time.

105
00:07:29.825 --> 00:07:32.327
<i>Kyoka Jiro!</i>
<i>Quirk: Earphone Jack!</i>

106
00:07:33.579 --> 00:07:35.539
<i>She can amplify and send</i>

107
00:07:35.706 --> 00:07:37.958
<i>her own explosively loud heartbeats</i>
<i>by inserting her plugs.</i>

108
00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:40.544
<i>She can also catch</i>
<i>very quiet sounds and stuff!</i>

109
00:07:40.711 --> 00:07:44.298
Kaminari. you should've requested
something to help you aim

110
00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:46.425
in your costume order!

111
00:07:50.012 --> 00:07:51.138
-Done!
-Huh?

112
00:07:52.014 --> 00:07:53.140
It takes some time…

113
00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:56.935
to create something big.

114
00:07:57.436 --> 00:07:58.478
A sheet?

115
00:07:58.645 --> 00:07:59.855
Is it supposed to be a shield?

116
00:08:01.148 --> 00:08:04.443
It's an insulation sheet
100 millimeters thick.

117
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:05.485
Kaminari.

118
00:08:06.987 --> 00:08:07.946
I see.

119
00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:14.912
In that case. I can be really strong!

120
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.381
Now then. I am worried about the others.

121
00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:27.841
Let us join them quickly.

122
00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:29.760
Wait. your clothes got super punk!

123
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.763
I can make them again!

124
00:08:33.722 --> 00:08:36.265
<i>Momo Yaoyorozu.</i>
<i>Quirk: Creation.</i>

125
00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:38.852
<i>She can create any non-living thing!</i>

126
00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:40.270
<i>What makes this possible</i>

127
00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:44.274
<i>is her vast knowledge and understanding</i>
<i>of the molecular structure of materials!</i>

128
00:08:45.484 --> 00:08:47.152
<i>Violent growth…</i>

129
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.572
Kaminari. don't look this way!

130
00:08:55.536 --> 00:08:57.829
<i>Denki Kaminari.</i>
<i>Quirk: Electrification!</i>

131
00:08:58.205 --> 00:09:01.375
<i>When he goes over his watt limit.</i>
<i>his brain short circuits.</i>

132
00:09:01.542 --> 00:09:03.752
<i>and he becomes a huge idiot for a while.</i>

133
00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:12.553
Hey. Midoriya. we're just here
to see how things are going. okay?

134
00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:13.804
Ribbit.

135
00:09:13.971 --> 00:09:15.013
I know.

136
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.307
We'll run away
the instant it seems dangerous.

137
00:09:31.154 --> 00:09:32.155
<i>Twenty-three seconds.</i>

138
00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:33.407
The last boss?

139
00:09:33.574 --> 00:09:34.950
<i>Twenty-four seconds.</i>

140
00:09:35.534 --> 00:09:36.535
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

141
00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:38.495
<i>Seventeen seconds.</i>

142
00:09:42.833 --> 00:09:43.750
Ribbit?

143
00:09:45.669 --> 00:09:47.171
Damn.

144
00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:50.048
It's hard to see
because you keep moving around.

145
00:09:50.841 --> 00:09:52.759
but there's an instant
when your hair falls.

146
00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:57.347
That's when you've finished an action.

147
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:02.144
And the space in between
has gotten shorter and shorter.

148
00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:06.690
Don't push yourself. Eraser Head.

149
00:10:13.322 --> 00:10:15.115
<i>My elbow's crumbling!</i>

150
00:10:21.038 --> 00:10:25.959
That Quirk isn't suited for fighting
long fights against a large group. is it?

151
00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:30.839
Isn't this too different
from your usual job?

152
00:10:31.632 --> 00:10:37.596
What you're good at is a short fight
after a surprise attack. right?

153
00:10:39.306 --> 00:10:42.643
Even so. you jumped right
in to fight us from the front.

154
00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:44.853
Was that to put your students at ease?

155
00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:58.158
You're so cool…

156
00:10:58.951 --> 00:11:00.661
You're so cool!

157
00:11:02.454 --> 00:11:04.164
By the way. hero…

158
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.585
I'm not the last boss.

159
00:11:16.385 --> 00:11:18.679
Mr. Aizawa…

160
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:24.601
Black Hole. which sucks up
everything and turns it all to dust.

161
00:11:24.768 --> 00:11:28.397
I see. That is an astounding Quirk.

162
00:11:28.564 --> 00:11:33.902
However. Thirteen. you are a hero
who works to rescue people from disasters.

163
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:36.154
As expected.

164
00:11:36.697 --> 00:11:41.243
your battle experience is less
than half of that of a normal hero.

165
00:11:46.498 --> 00:11:47.499
<i>A warp gate!</i>

166
00:11:53.172 --> 00:11:55.924
You turned yourself into dust.

167
00:12:02.139 --> 00:12:03.515
<i>He got me…</i>

168
00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:05.017
Teacher!

169
00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:08.228
Iida. run!

170
00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:09.855
Hurry!

171
00:12:10.022 --> 00:12:13.066
<i>Use your Quirk in order to save others!</i>

172
00:12:18.614 --> 00:12:20.949
Damn it!

173
00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:24.328
<i>One of the children</i>
<i>who was not scattered…</i>

174
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.414
<i>We are only waiting for All Might.</i>

175
00:12:29.041 --> 00:12:33.086
<i>If the other teachers are called here.</i>
<i>it will be hard for us.</i>

176
00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:36.798
<i>Everyone…</i>

177
00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:38.717
<i>was entrusted…</i>

178
00:12:39.885 --> 00:12:40.886
<i>to me!</i>

179
00:12:42.012 --> 00:12:43.263
<i>The whole class…</i>

180
00:12:44.556 --> 00:12:45.933
<i>I will…</i>

181
00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:50.103
Go!

182
00:12:50.938 --> 00:12:51.855
Hurry!

183
00:12:53.774 --> 00:12:55.692
<i>Everyone. wait for me!</i>

184
00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:57.402
You impertinent…

185
00:12:59.738 --> 00:13:01.198
I will not allow you to go outside!

186
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.575
<i>An automatic door!</i>
<i>Should I kick it down?</i>

187
00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:05.160
<i>Is it a thickness I can kick down?</i>

188
00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:07.955
You're impudent. four-eyes.

189
00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:10.415
Be gone!

190
00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:14.920
<i>Villains.</i>

191
00:13:16.964 --> 00:13:18.674
<i>The world of pros.</i>

192
00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:23.428
<i>We still hadn't seen</i>
<i>anything yet.</i>

193
00:13:25.764 --> 00:13:28.725
I'll tell you. Eraser Head.

194
00:13:31.228 --> 00:13:35.023
He's the anti-Symbol of Peace.

195
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.025
the bioengineered "Nomu."

196
00:13:48.954 --> 00:13:51.206
COLLAPSE ZONE

197
00:13:52.082 --> 00:13:53.041
Die!

198
00:14:04.136 --> 00:14:06.388
Is this all of them? They're so weak.

199
00:14:06.555 --> 00:14:09.808
All right. Let's hurry up
and go save the others!

200
00:14:09.975 --> 00:14:13.979
If we're here. then everyone else
should be inside USJ. too.

201
00:14:14.146 --> 00:14:16.273
I'm worried about the guys
with less offensive ability.

202
00:14:16.607 --> 00:14:18.650
<i>Besides. because we ran off ahead.</i>

203
00:14:19.026 --> 00:14:21.236
<i>we slowed Thirteen down.</i>

204
00:14:21.904 --> 00:14:23.655
If Thirteen
had been able to suck up that fog.

205
00:14:23.822 --> 00:14:25.699
then this wouldn't have happened!

206
00:14:25.866 --> 00:14:27.492
As men. we have to take responsibility
for what we did!

207
00:14:27.868 --> 00:14:30.162
If you want to go.
then go by yourself.

208
00:14:30.329 --> 00:14:32.664
I'm gonna kill that warp gate.

209
00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:36.043
What? You're gonna act childish
at a time like this?

210
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:37.419
Besides. that guy's attacks are…

211
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.046
Shut up!

212
00:14:39.213 --> 00:14:41.507
That gate bastard
is the enemy's way in and out.

213
00:14:42.007 --> 00:14:45.302
I'm gonna cut off their getaway route
for when the time comes.

214
00:14:45.469 --> 00:14:47.262
It's not like we don't have a way
to fight the fog.

215
00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:51.266
Stop your chit-chatting!
Since you've left your guard down…

216
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:54.770
Anyway.

217
00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:57.898
if these small fry
are the ones assigned to us.

218
00:14:58.065 --> 00:14:59.775
pretty much everyone'll be fine. right?

219
00:14:59.942 --> 00:15:02.027
<i>That reaction time was amazing…</i>

220
00:15:02.444 --> 00:15:05.405
Anyway. were you always
so calm and rational?

221
00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:07.407
I thought you were more like…

222
00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:10.118
Die!

223
00:15:10.285 --> 00:15:12.579
I'm always calm and rational.
you spiky-haired punk!

224
00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:13.997
Oh yeah. that's more like it.

225
00:15:15.707 --> 00:15:17.125
Then go if you want to!

226
00:15:17.292 --> 00:15:18.377
Wait!

227
00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:20.379
Believing in our friends!

228
00:15:20.546 --> 00:15:22.422
That's real manly. Bakugo!

229
00:15:23.632 --> 00:15:25.092
I'll follow you!

230
00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:28.595
FIRE ZONE

231
00:15:28.971 --> 00:15:30.973
Damn it! He's too fast!

232
00:15:35.644 --> 00:15:37.271
I see him! Over there!

233
00:15:39.106 --> 00:15:41.191
<i>First. I need to make sure</i>
<i>I'm not caught by the enemy.</i>

234
00:15:41.358 --> 00:15:43.193
SQUALL ZONE

235
00:15:43.986 --> 00:15:45.195
Found you!

236
00:15:50.826 --> 00:15:52.411
That makes six.

237
00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:56.707
If we can just reduce
enemy numbers little by little

238
00:15:57.291 --> 00:15:58.917
<i>until help comes…</i>

239
00:16:00.586 --> 00:16:02.754
You're being impudent. four-eyes.

240
00:16:03.714 --> 00:16:04.756
Be gone!

241
00:16:12.097 --> 00:16:13.724
I don't know the theory behind it.

242
00:16:13.891 --> 00:16:15.851
but if he's wearing
something like this.

243
00:16:16.018 --> 00:16:18.145
then it must mean
he has a physical body.

244
00:16:19.605 --> 00:16:21.773
Go. Iida!

245
00:16:22.274 --> 00:16:23.942
My body! Oh. no!

246
00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:30.407
However…

247
00:16:30.574 --> 00:16:32.326
I won't let you!

248
00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:42.628
Go!

249
00:16:47.466 --> 00:16:49.468
Engine Boost!

250
00:16:56.058 --> 00:16:58.018
<i>He's going to call for support.</i>

251
00:16:59.186 --> 00:17:00.687
<i>It's game over.</i>

252
00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:11.073
You can erase Quirks.

253
00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.825
That's wonderful.
but it's nothing impressive.

254
00:17:14.242 --> 00:17:19.205
In the face of overwhelming power.
you might as well be Quirkless.

255
00:17:25.921 --> 00:17:27.881
<i>It's like he's breaking a twig…</i>

256
00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:31.426
<i>I'm sure I erased his Quirk.</i>

257
00:17:31.593 --> 00:17:34.930
<i>That means he is just that strong.</i>

258
00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:39.351
<i>He's as strong as All Might…</i>

259
00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:46.316
Midoriya. I can't take it anymore.

260
00:17:46.483 --> 00:17:49.111
I'm sure you must be having
second thoughts. right?

261
00:17:49.278 --> 00:17:50.153
Ribbit…

262
00:17:54.658 --> 00:17:56.243
Tomura Shigaraki.

263
00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:59.454
Kurogiri. did you kill Thirteen?

264
00:17:59.621 --> 00:18:01.999
I put Thirteen out of action.

265
00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:04.835
but there were students
that I was unable to disperse.

266
00:18:05.002 --> 00:18:06.920
and one of them was able to run away.

267
00:18:08.255 --> 00:18:09.631
Huh?

268
00:18:21.435 --> 00:18:24.188
Kurogiri. you…

269
00:18:25.355 --> 00:18:27.941
If you weren't a warp gate.

270
00:18:28.108 --> 00:18:30.360
I would've crushed you to pieces.

271
00:18:34.823 --> 00:18:38.869
We can't win against dozens of pros.

272
00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:41.622
It's game over.

273
00:18:41.788 --> 00:18:45.501
Man. it's game over this time.

274
00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:47.336
Let's go home.

275
00:18:48.504 --> 00:18:49.713
They're going home?

276
00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.423
Did he say they're going home?

277
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:52.841
That's what I heard.

278
00:18:55.469 --> 00:18:58.180
All right! We're saved!

279
00:18:58.347 --> 00:18:59.932
Yes. but…

280
00:19:03.101 --> 00:19:05.312
I have a bad feeling about this. Midoriya.

281
00:19:05.479 --> 00:19:06.522
Yeah.

282
00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:09.775
For them to simply retreat
after doing all this…

283
00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:13.195
<i>Don't they want to kill All Might?</i>

284
00:19:13.362 --> 00:19:16.990
<i>If they leave like this.</i>
<i>U.A. will just beef up their security.</i>

285
00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:18.784
<i>"Game over"?</i>

286
00:19:19.243 --> 00:19:22.454
<i>What's going on?</i>
<i>What are those guys planning?</i>

287
00:19:23.789 --> 00:19:25.415
Oh. yeah.

288
00:19:25.582 --> 00:19:27.000
Before we leave.

289
00:19:27.167 --> 00:19:31.213
let's smash some of his pride…

290
00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:35.717
as the Symbol of Peace!

291
00:19:51.483 --> 00:19:52.651
Damn it.

292
00:19:53.443 --> 00:19:56.655
You really are cool…

293
00:19:58.991 --> 00:20:00.784
Eraser Head.

294
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:06.206
<i>Crap!</i>

295
00:20:07.082 --> 00:20:08.876
<i>He's clearly different</i>
<i>from our earlier opponents.</i>

296
00:20:09.543 --> 00:20:12.045
<i>I've gotta save Asui and run away!</i>

297
00:20:12.504 --> 00:20:14.464
Let go of her!

298
00:20:15.048 --> 00:20:17.843
Smash!

299
00:20:31.982 --> 00:20:33.609
<i>My arm's not broken?</i>

300
00:20:33.775 --> 00:20:36.236
<i>I'm finally able to control</i>
<i>my power at a time like this?</i>

301
00:20:36.403 --> 00:20:39.531
<i>I did it!</i>
<i>I was able to get in a good smash!</i>

302
00:20:39.698 --> 00:20:40.616
<i>All right!</i>

303
00:20:44.453 --> 00:20:46.205
<i>When in the world…</i>

304
00:20:46.955 --> 00:20:50.209
<i>Wait. it didn't… hurt him?</i>

305
00:20:52.336 --> 00:20:54.505
Don't you think they are trying so hard

306
00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:56.798
because they have a way to kill him?

307
00:20:58.091 --> 00:20:59.134
<i>No way…</i>

308
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:04.056
You move well. Your "Smash"…

309
00:21:04.223 --> 00:21:06.808
Are you a follower of All Might's?

310
00:21:07.601 --> 00:21:10.270
Oh well. I'm done with you.

311
00:21:16.193 --> 00:21:17.277
Ribbit!

312
00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.987
It's fine now!

313
00:22:04.616 --> 00:22:06.368
I am here!

314
00:22:07.035 --> 00:22:08.871
All Might!

315
00:22:09.746 --> 00:22:11.206
Ribbit…

316
00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:16.336
All… Might…

317
00:22:24.553 --> 00:22:28.765
Oh. we're getting a "Continue"…

318
00:24:00.691 --> 00:24:02.526
NEXT TIME

319
00:24:02.693 --> 00:24:05.362
<i>It's fine now. I am here!</i>

320
00:24:05.529 --> 00:24:06.738
<i>Next time. "All Might."</i>

321
00:24:07.197 --> 00:24:08.740
<i>As you can see.</i>

322
00:24:08.907 --> 00:24:10.951
<i>they'll keep going</i>
<i>after my weakness!</i>

323
00:24:11.118 --> 00:24:12.494
<i>Go beyond!</i>

324
00:24:12.661 --> 00:24:14.413
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>

325
00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:15.539
NEXT TIME: ALL MIGHT
