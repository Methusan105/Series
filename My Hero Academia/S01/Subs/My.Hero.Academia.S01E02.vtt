00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:15.098
<i>It's fine now. Why?</i>

2
00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:21.271
<i>Because I am here.</i>

3
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.489
He's so cool!

4
00:00:31.073 --> 00:00:34.743
Once I get my Quirk.
I wanna be like him. too!

5
00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:37.746
You should probably give it up.

6
00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:43.836
<i>Even if that was true…</i>

7
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:47.756
You're below the rejects!
You're Quirkless!

8
00:00:47.923 --> 00:00:50.634
How can you even stand
in the same ring as me?

9
00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.763
What the hell can you do?

10
00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.976
<i>Even if that's what everyone thinks…</i>

11
00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:01.436
I'm sorry. Izuku!

12
00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:03.522
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

13
00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:11.196
<i>No. that's not it.</i>
<i>That's not it. Mom.</i>

14
00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:15.075
<i>I…</i>

15
00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:17.744
<i>Even so. I…</i>

16
00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:22.833
Even if I don't have a Quirk.
can I become a hero?

17
00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:28.297
Can even someone without a Quirk

18
00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:31.049
be like you?

19
00:01:41.894 --> 00:01:43.562
Without a Quirk?

20
00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:56.950
Oh no. holy shit.

21
00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:58.202
goddammit…

22
00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.333
It might've been
because I don't have a Quirk.

23
00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:07.336
but I'm always made fun of.

24
00:02:07.503 --> 00:02:10.255
Maybe that's why…
I don't know.

25
00:02:10.422 --> 00:02:14.384
But I think
saving people is super cool.

26
00:02:15.844 --> 00:02:18.388
Saving people with a fearless smile.

27
00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:22.100
I want to be the greatest hero.

28
00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:23.685
like you!

29
00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:07.873
TATOOIN SHOPPING DISTRICT
WELCOME

30
00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:18.634
Where am I?
What happened?

31
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.971
-Texas Smash!
<i>-Oh yeah. That bastard…</i>

32
00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:28.852
If it weren't for that bastard…

33
00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:32.981
Hey. Katsuki. aren't you
and Midoriya childhood friends?

34
00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:36.151
You went a little overboard today.

35
00:04:36.318 --> 00:04:39.363
It's his fault for getting in my way.

36
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.698
Don't let it get to you.

37
00:04:44.368 --> 00:04:48.080
It's just that it's been my goal
ever since I was little.

38
00:04:48.247 --> 00:04:50.123
And well.

39
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.751
I won't know unless I try.

40
00:04:53.544 --> 00:04:56.713
He's an idiot dreaming like a kid!

41
00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:00.092
Just watching him pisses me off!

42
00:05:02.511 --> 00:05:04.930
Then. why don't we go to the arcade
for a change of pace?

43
00:05:05.097 --> 00:05:06.557
You'll come. too. right. Katsuki?

44
00:05:07.224 --> 00:05:08.100
Yeah.

45
00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:10.352
Then let's go to the one
in front of the station.

46
00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:12.104
There's lots of prey there.

47
00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:14.064
You're terrible.

48
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:17.526
What? If we get caught.
it'll end up on my record!

49
00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:20.112
Hey. look!

50
00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:25.158
An invisible cloak with a great Quirk!

51
00:05:26.118 --> 00:05:29.955
EPISODE TWO:
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A HERO

52
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.756
You're deflating!

53
00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:43.468
Wait. up until now…
Huh?

54
00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:46.430
Fake? A fake? You're so skinny!

55
00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:50.642
I am All Might…

56
00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:54.146
No way!

57
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:59.109
<i>You know how the guys at the pool</i>
<i>are constantly flexing and posturing?</i>

58
00:05:59.276 --> 00:06:02.154
-It's like that.
-No way!

59
00:06:04.615 --> 00:06:06.074
It can't be…

60
00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:11.371
All Might is fearless…
He saves everyone with a smile…

61
00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:13.498
He's the greatest…

62
00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:17.294
A fearless smile. huh?

63
00:06:21.215 --> 00:06:23.675
Now that you've seen me like this.
young man.

64
00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:26.053
make sure you don't write about it online.
even accidentally.

65
00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:33.185
It's an injury I got
from an enemy's attack five years ago.

66
00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:35.854
Half of my respiratory organs
were destroyed.

67
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:37.814
and I lost my whole stomach.

68
00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:39.983
I've become emaciated
from repeated surgeries

69
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.152
and the aftereffects.

70
00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:47.366
Right now. I can only work as a hero

71
00:06:47.533 --> 00:06:49.868
for about three hours a day.

72
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:52.871
That can't be…

73
00:06:53.038 --> 00:06:56.625
Five years ago… Was that
when you fought Toxic Chainsaw?

74
00:06:57.209 --> 00:06:58.836
You're well-informed.

75
00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:02.506
But a punk like that couldn't defeat me.

76
00:07:03.632 --> 00:07:06.510
This fight was not made public
to the world.

77
00:07:06.677 --> 00:07:09.388
I asked that it not be made public.

78
00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:14.434
I will save people with a smile!

79
00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:18.814
The Symbol of Peace
cannot be daunted by evil.

80
00:07:20.524 --> 00:07:23.902
I smile to show the pressure of heroes

81
00:07:24.862 --> 00:07:29.408
and to trick the fear inside of me.

82
00:07:32.077 --> 00:07:35.247
Pros are always risking their lives.

83
00:07:35.414 --> 00:07:37.875
I cannot simply say:

84
00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:41.128
"You can become a hero
even without power."

85
00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:46.466
I see…

86
00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:50.429
If you want to help others.

87
00:07:50.596 --> 00:07:52.723
then you could also become
a police officer.

88
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.934
They're often teased because they get
villains delivered to their doorstep.

89
00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:58.687
but that is also a fine occupation.

90
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.650
It's not bad to dream.

91
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.989
But you also have to consider
what's realistic. young man.

92
00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:18.123
Now. I need to quickly get this guy…

93
00:08:34.932 --> 00:08:36.350
Don't tell me…

94
00:08:42.438 --> 00:08:44.775
A villain!
What hero will go to the scene?

95
00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:50.405
<i>I cannot simply say:</i>

96
00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:54.034
<i>"You can become a hero</i>
<i>even without power."</i>

97
00:09:10.968 --> 00:09:13.470
TATOOIN SHOPPING DISTRICT
WELCOME

98
00:09:17.307 --> 00:09:18.433
It's a villain!

99
00:09:25.858 --> 00:09:27.734
A child was taken hostage?

100
00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:30.904
You coward!

101
00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:39.830
What is this?
I can't grab hold!

102
00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:44.626
Death Arms!

103
00:09:44.793 --> 00:09:45.961
Crap!

104
00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:50.674
Don't come near me!

105
00:09:55.262 --> 00:10:00.893
I won't let sewage like this
swallow me!

106
00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:04.438
You little…

107
00:10:10.569 --> 00:10:12.237
<i>What power!</i>

108
00:10:12.404 --> 00:10:14.198
<i>I've hit the jackpot!</i>

109
00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:19.578
<i>With this Quirk and power.</i>
<i>I can get revenge on that guy!</i>

110
00:10:20.871 --> 00:10:25.083
Woah. what's that?
Could he be a big-shot villain?

111
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.879
She's here!
The rookie hero. Mt. Lady!

112
00:10:29.046 --> 00:10:34.176
Wait… I need there to be
at least two lanes!

113
00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:41.517
I'm not good with explosions!

114
00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:43.810
I'll leave it to someone else for today!

115
00:10:44.353 --> 00:10:45.354
Thanks for that.

116
00:10:45.521 --> 00:10:47.189
I have my hands full fighting the fire.

117
00:10:47.356 --> 00:10:48.899
The fire truck's not here yet?

118
00:10:49.066 --> 00:10:50.275
How are things over there?

119
00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:52.402
He's sticky and hard to grab.

120
00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:55.155
and a child with a strong Quirk
is struggling against him.

121
00:10:55.781 --> 00:10:57.324
Thanks to that. it's a minefield.

122
00:10:57.491 --> 00:10:59.660
It's hard to do anything
against this triple play!

123
00:11:04.915 --> 00:11:06.083
Crap!

124
00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:08.126
It's no use!

125
00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:10.712
There's no one who can take care of this
at the scene right now!

126
00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:13.841
All we can do is wait for someone
with a more suitable Quirk!

127
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.969
Let's hold back the damage
until then!

128
00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:19.471
Don't worry.
I'm sure someone will be here soon!

129
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:23.517
I feel bad for that child. but he'll just
have to bear it a little longer.

130
00:11:23.684 --> 00:11:24.852
Damn it!

131
00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:28.605
If only I had enough power
to blow that guy away!

132
00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:32.025
Hey. doesn't it look kinda bad?

133
00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:33.819
You can do it. heroes!

134
00:11:41.243 --> 00:11:42.536
<i>It was back then!</i>

135
00:11:43.662 --> 00:11:46.790
<i>I was too distracted by my time limit!</i>

136
00:11:46.957 --> 00:11:50.252
<i>I can't believe I made a mistake like this</i>
<i>after admonishing that fan.</i>

137
00:11:50.419 --> 00:11:52.004
<i>Pathetic…</i>

138
00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:55.382
<i>Pathetic…</i>

139
00:12:12.816 --> 00:12:17.112
<i>He still can't face reality. even though</i>
<i>he's already a third year in junior high.</i>

140
00:12:17.863 --> 00:12:21.408
<i>It's time for you to think</i>
<i>seriously about your future.</i>

141
00:12:21.575 --> 00:12:24.328
<i>You also have to consider</i>
<i>what's realistic.</i>

142
00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:26.580
HERO ANALYSIS FOR THE FUTURE

143
00:12:27.331 --> 00:12:29.833
<i>Even a top pro said it.</i>

144
00:12:31.168 --> 00:12:33.587
<i>Don't cry! You knew. didn't you?</i>

145
00:12:33.754 --> 00:12:34.963
<i>The reality.</i>

146
00:12:36.048 --> 00:12:39.218
<i>You knew. That's why</i>
<i>you were trying so desperately.</i>

147
00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:42.721
<i>You were averting your eyes.</i>
<i>not looking at reality.</i>

148
00:12:46.767 --> 00:12:49.770
<i>Is this where the explosion earlier was?</i>

149
00:12:50.896 --> 00:12:55.400
<i>Hang on. does that mean</i>
<i>I came out of habit without noticing?</i>

150
00:12:56.902 --> 00:13:00.447
<i>Stop it. It'll just feel</i>
<i>meaningless right now.</i>

151
00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:04.117
<i>Why's that guy here?</i>

152
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.496
<i>Did it get away from All Might?</i>

153
00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:13.001
<i>Did he drop it?</i>

154
00:13:13.669 --> 00:13:14.920
<i>If he did…</i>

155
00:13:16.547 --> 00:13:19.383
then it's my fault.

156
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.635
Why aren't the heroes doing anything?

157
00:13:21.802 --> 00:13:24.888
They can't. Apparently the villain
caught a junior high schooler.

158
00:13:25.556 --> 00:13:27.224
It's been like that for a while.

159
00:13:28.058 --> 00:13:31.144
Caught?
It's been like that for a while?

160
00:13:32.062 --> 00:13:34.147
<i>How can they bear that suffocation?</i>

161
00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:37.568
<i>I thought I'd die after a few seconds.</i>

162
00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:40.571
<i>Wow.</i>

163
00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:44.533
Anyway. wasn't that villain
the one All Might was chasing earlier?

164
00:13:45.284 --> 00:13:48.078
All Might? No way! He's here?

165
00:13:48.245 --> 00:13:50.122
I think I saw him earlier.

166
00:13:50.289 --> 00:13:51.206
Seriously?

167
00:13:51.832 --> 00:13:54.459
Then what's All Might doing?

168
00:14:00.966 --> 00:14:02.634
<i>It's my fault!</i>

169
00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:04.678
<i>He can't do anything!</i>

170
00:14:06.305 --> 00:14:07.931
<i>Pathetic…</i>

171
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.601
<i>He can't catch that guy.</i>

172
00:14:11.143 --> 00:14:14.354
<i>All we can do is wait for a hero</i>
<i>with a more suitable Quirk!</i>

173
00:14:15.981 --> 00:14:17.733
<i>Pathetic…</i>

174
00:14:18.192 --> 00:14:20.819
<i>Do your best! I'm sorry!</i>

175
00:14:20.986 --> 00:14:22.237
<i>I'm so sorry!</i>

176
00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:24.531
<i>Pathetic!</i>

177
00:14:24.698 --> 00:14:27.201
<i>Help will arrive soon…</i>

178
00:14:28.118 --> 00:14:29.411
<i>Pathetic!</i>

179
00:14:30.162 --> 00:14:33.665
<i>Someone…</i>
<i>A hero… will soon…</i>

180
00:14:56.188 --> 00:14:58.232
Idiot! Stop!

181
00:14:58.398 --> 00:14:59.983
Stop!

182
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.693
That brat…

183
00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:02.778
Deku…

184
00:15:03.695 --> 00:15:06.073
<i>Why did I run out?</i>
<i>What am I doing?</i>

185
00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:07.950
<i>Why?</i>

186
00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:09.952
Die in an explosion!

187
00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:14.289
What do I do at a time like this?

188
00:15:14.456 --> 00:15:15.457
BINDING LACQUERED CHAIN PRISON

189
00:15:15.624 --> 00:15:17.084
<i>Page 25!</i>

190
00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:19.962
Take that!

191
00:15:28.387 --> 00:15:29.346
Kacchan!

192
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.767
-Why are you here?
-My legs moved on their own!

193
00:15:33.934 --> 00:15:36.019
I don't know why. though!

194
00:15:38.522 --> 00:15:40.524
<i>I think there were various reasons.</i>

195
00:15:40.691 --> 00:15:41.859
You should probably give it up.

196
00:15:42.025 --> 00:15:42.901
<i>It's my fault…</i>

197
00:15:43.068 --> 00:15:44.278
<i>How can you even stand</i>
<i>in the same ring as me?</i>

198
00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:45.320
<i>He's so cool!</i>

199
00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:46.822
<i>-Unless I try…</i>
<i>-Kacchan!</i>

200
00:15:46.989 --> 00:15:48.365
<i>-It's been my goal…</i>
<i>-I'll do my best!</i>

201
00:15:48.532 --> 00:15:50.409
<i>He saves everyone with a smile…</i>

202
00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:53.579
<i>But at that moment…</i>

203
00:15:55.581 --> 00:15:59.334
You looked like you were asking for help…

204
00:16:02.838 --> 00:16:05.215
Stop it!

205
00:16:06.675 --> 00:16:08.010
<i>Pathetic…</i>

206
00:16:09.428 --> 00:16:11.054
<i>Pathetic!</i>

207
00:16:12.347 --> 00:16:14.433
<i>Just a little longer.</i>

208
00:16:14.975 --> 00:16:16.351
Don't get in my way!

209
00:16:16.977 --> 00:16:19.104
He'll die in vain! Is he suicidal?

210
00:16:29.948 --> 00:16:31.575
I really am pathetic.

211
00:16:34.453 --> 00:16:36.038
All Might…

212
00:16:36.538 --> 00:16:38.832
Even though I admonished you.

213
00:16:38.999 --> 00:16:42.336
I wasn't putting what I said
into practice!

214
00:16:46.507 --> 00:16:50.427
Pros are always risking their lives!

215
00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:53.180
All Might!

216
00:16:53.347 --> 00:16:57.100
Detroit Smash!

217
00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:33.262
Rain?

218
00:17:34.304 --> 00:17:36.890
Don't tell me it's from
the wind pressure just now?

219
00:17:37.057 --> 00:17:39.017
An updraft developed and…

220
00:17:43.313 --> 00:17:46.316
He made… clouds?

221
00:17:52.239 --> 00:17:53.866
Hey!

222
00:17:55.075 --> 00:17:58.370
With just his right fist.
he changed the weather!

223
00:17:58.537 --> 00:17:59.997
That's amazing!

224
00:18:00.163 --> 00:18:02.708
That's All Might for ya!

225
00:18:15.554 --> 00:18:19.808
<i>After this. heroes</i>
<i>collected the scattered sludge.</i>

226
00:18:19.975 --> 00:18:23.145
<i>and safely delivered it to the police.</i>

227
00:18:27.191 --> 00:18:29.735
Jeez. there's a limit
to how rash you can be!

228
00:18:29.902 --> 00:18:32.988
There was absolutely no reason
for you to put yourself in danger!

229
00:18:33.989 --> 00:18:37.034
<i>I got majorly scolded</i>
<i>by the heroes.</i>

230
00:18:37.201 --> 00:18:39.786
<i>but Kacchan was praised.</i>

231
00:18:39.953 --> 00:18:41.496
That was amazing toughness!

232
00:18:41.663 --> 00:18:42.915
And that Quirk!

233
00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:46.210
Once you're a pro.
please come to my agency!

234
00:18:46.376 --> 00:18:49.338
You'll definitely be
an excellent sidekick!

235
00:19:07.481 --> 00:19:11.401
<i>I wanted to apologize to All Might.</i>
<i>but he was still getting interviewed.</i>

236
00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:15.948
<i>I'll try sending him a message</i>
<i>on his website when I get home.</i>

237
00:19:16.114 --> 00:19:17.241
Deku!

238
00:19:18.992 --> 00:19:20.369
Kacchan?

239
00:19:25.207 --> 00:19:29.711
I never asked you for help!

240
00:19:29.878 --> 00:19:33.006
And you didn't help me! Got it?

241
00:19:33.173 --> 00:19:34.550
I was fine by myself.

242
00:19:34.716 --> 00:19:36.718
You're a Quirkless failure
playing without a full deck!

243
00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:38.554
Don't think you can
look down on me!

244
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.138
Are you trying to make me owe you?

245
00:19:40.305 --> 00:19:42.182
Don't look down on me!

246
00:19:43.183 --> 00:19:44.643
You damn nerd!

247
00:19:46.103 --> 00:19:47.771
<i>"Toughness"…</i>

248
00:19:50.899 --> 00:19:52.901
<i>It's just as Kacchan said.</i>

249
00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:56.154
<i>It's not like I accomplished anything.</i>
<i>or changed anything.</i>

250
00:19:56.321 --> 00:19:58.365
<i>But. I'm glad.</i>

251
00:19:58.991 --> 00:20:01.702
<i>Now I can think of a realistic future.</i>

252
00:20:01.869 --> 00:20:02.870
I am here!

253
00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:06.164
All Might?

254
00:20:06.331 --> 00:20:07.583
Why are you here?

255
00:20:07.749 --> 00:20:09.751
You were surrounded
by reporters until just now.

256
00:20:11.962 --> 00:20:13.714
Getting away from them
was a piece of cake.

257
00:20:14.256 --> 00:20:15.174
Why?

258
00:20:15.674 --> 00:20:17.676
Because I am All Might…

259
00:20:25.475 --> 00:20:26.643
Young man.

260
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:30.564
I come with thanks. a correction.
and a suggestion.

261
00:20:32.024 --> 00:20:33.942
If you hadn't been there.

262
00:20:34.109 --> 00:20:36.653
if you hadn't told me
about your life.

263
00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.489
I would've turned into a guy
in a bodysuit who was all talk.

264
00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:40.574
Thank you.

265
00:20:40.741 --> 00:20:44.328
That can't be…
It was my fault in the first place.

266
00:20:44.494 --> 00:20:46.622
I got in the way of your work.

267
00:20:46.788 --> 00:20:50.083
and I said all those impertinent
things even though I'm Quirkless…

268
00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:51.210
That's right.

269
00:20:51.752 --> 00:20:53.795
It was because it was none other

270
00:20:53.962 --> 00:20:57.132
than the timid. Quirkless you
at the scene

271
00:20:57.299 --> 00:20:58.675
that I was able to act.

272
00:21:02.346 --> 00:21:06.058
Top heroes have stories
about them from their school days.

273
00:21:06.225 --> 00:21:09.144
Most of their stories
have one thing in common:

274
00:21:12.147 --> 00:21:16.193
<i>Their bodies moved</i>
<i>before they had a chance to think.</i>

275
00:21:25.661 --> 00:21:27.663
<i>For some reason.</i>

276
00:21:27.829 --> 00:21:29.915
<i>I remembered my mother's words.</i>

277
00:21:30.749 --> 00:21:32.417
<i>I'm sorry. Izuku!</i>

278
00:21:33.377 --> 00:21:35.963
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry!</i>

279
00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:41.301
That was true for you. too. wasn't it?

280
00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.972
Yeah…

281
00:21:47.057 --> 00:21:49.309
<i>That's not it. Mom.</i>

282
00:21:50.561 --> 00:21:53.605
<i>Back then. what I wanted you to say…</i>

283
00:21:56.817 --> 00:21:59.278
<i>The words I wanted to hear were…</i>

284
00:22:03.657 --> 00:22:06.910
You can become a hero.

285
00:22:16.253 --> 00:22:18.589
<i>Dreams can become reality.</i>

286
00:22:21.717 --> 00:22:23.927
<i>By the way. I forgot to mention</i>

287
00:22:24.094 --> 00:22:28.682
<i>that this is the story</i>
<i>of how I became the greatest hero.</i>

288
00:24:01.108 --> 00:24:02.276
NEXT TIME

289
00:24:02.442 --> 00:24:03.569
<i>Young man.</i>

290
00:24:03.735 --> 00:24:06.697
<i>you are worthy to inherit my power.</i>

291
00:24:06.864 --> 00:24:09.074
<i>Inherit your power?</i>

292
00:24:09.241 --> 00:24:12.995
<i>Take my Quirk. One For All!</i>

293
00:24:13.537 --> 00:24:16.081
<i>With this.</i>
<i>I can become a hero. too. right?</i>

294
00:24:17.207 --> 00:24:19.626
<i>Of course not.</i>
<i>Your body can't take it.</i>

295
00:24:19.793 --> 00:24:20.711
<i>Huh?</i>

296
00:24:21.545 --> 00:24:23.172
<i>Next time. "Roaring Muscles"!</i>

297
00:24:23.714 --> 00:24:26.466
<i>Young Midoriya will get buff!</i>

298
00:24:26.633 --> 00:24:28.343
<i>Go beyond!</i>

299
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:30.387
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
