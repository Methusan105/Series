00:00:05.422 --> 00:00:06.340
<i>With all my strength…</i>

2
00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:10.427
<i>I'll do what I can right now!</i>

3
00:00:12.763 --> 00:00:14.348
Smash!

4
00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.980
<i>It doesn't hurt as much as before…</i>

5
00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:29.696
<i>It wasn't a throw that relied on power.</i>

6
00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.783
<i>He just concentrated all the power</i>
<i>into his fingertip?</i>

7
00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:34.660
<i>Mr. Aizawa…</i>

8
00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:40.457
<i>I can still move!</i>

9
00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:43.961
This kid…

10
00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:16.553
He got over 700 meters?

11
00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:19.348
Finally. a hero-like record!

12
00:02:19.515 --> 00:02:21.683
His finger's swollen!

13
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.645
There was the entrance exam. too.
He has a strange Quirk…

14
00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:26.355
It's not very stylish.

15
00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:28.982
<i>What's with that power?</i>

16
00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:32.653
<i>Everyone's Quirks</i>
<i>manifest by the age of four.</i>

17
00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:33.737
<i>This is unthinkable!</i>

18
00:02:34.196 --> 00:02:35.531
<i>But in reality…</i>

19
00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:38.575
<i>Someone told me:</i>

20
00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:41.662
"You can become a hero"…

21
00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:44.081
<i>That it was because of my own effort!</i>

22
00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:47.292
What is the meaning of this?

23
00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:52.422
Hey! Tell me what's going on.
Deku. you bastard!

24
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.723
What the…
This cloth is hard!

25
00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:05.269
They're weapons for capture
made of carbon fiber

26
00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:07.437
woven together with metal wire
made of a special alloy.

27
00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:09.481
Jeez…

28
00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:14.152
Don't keep making me use
my Quirk over and over.

29
00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:16.864
I have dry eye.

30
00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:19.741
<i>It's such a waste.</i>
<i>since his Quirk is so amazing!</i>

31
00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:23.954
<i>U.A. High's homeroom teacher</i>
<i>for Class 1-A. Shota Aizawa.</i>

32
00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:26.081
<i>He can erase the Quirks</i>
<i>of those he looks at.</i>

33
00:03:26.248 --> 00:03:27.541
<i>The effect goes away</i>
<i>when he blinks!</i>

34
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.377
We're wasting time.

35
00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:32.254
Whoever's next. get ready.

36
00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:38.760
Is your finger all right?

37
00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:40.512
Oh. yeah.

38
00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:44.183
<i>Until a little while ago.</i>

39
00:03:44.892 --> 00:03:47.728
<i>he was just a pebble</i>
<i>on the side of the road.</i>

40
00:03:49.146 --> 00:03:50.647
You're so lucky. Kacchan.

41
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.275
Your Quirk's so cool!

42
00:03:53.442 --> 00:03:55.527
I hope I get mine soon. too.

43
00:03:56.028 --> 00:04:00.157
No matter what Quirk you get.
you'll never beat me.

44
00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:03.869
<i>A pebble…</i>

45
00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:06.371
<i>on the side of the road!</i>

46
00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:10.375
EPISODE SIX:
RAGE. YOU DAMN NERD

47
00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:12.628
<i>After that.</i>

48
00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:14.505
<i>I fought against the pain</i>

49
00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:16.380
<i>as we finished</i>

50
00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:18.382
<i>the rest of the fitness tests.</i>

51
00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:28.352
Okay. I'll quickly tell you the results.

52
00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:32.814
The total is simply the marks
you got from each test.

53
00:04:33.315 --> 00:04:37.528
It's a waste of time to explain verbally.
so I'll show you the results all at once.

54
00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:40.489
<i>The person with the lowest total score</i>
<i>will be expelled.</i>

55
00:04:40.656 --> 00:04:43.825
<i>The only result I had that was any good</i>
<i>was in the ball throw.</i>

56
00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:48.288
<i>For the rest of the tests.</i>
<i>I did terribly because of the pain.</i>

57
00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:55.796
1 MOMO YAOYOROZU

8 KIRISHIMA - 9 ASHIDO - 10 URARAKA

60
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.053
<i>Last place will be…</i>

61
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.222
<i>expelled?</i>

62
00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:13.605
By the way.
I was lying about the expulsion.

63
00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:19.486
It was a rational deception to draw out
the upper limits of your Quirks.

64
00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:20.779
What?

65
00:05:21.113 --> 00:05:23.031
Of course that was a lie.

66
00:05:23.574 --> 00:05:25.534
It should've been obvious
if you just thought it through.

67
00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:28.036
<i>I didn't notice…</i>

68
00:05:28.412 --> 00:05:30.038
That was a little nerve-wracking. huh?

69
00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:31.915
I'll take up the challenge anytime!

70
00:05:34.543 --> 00:05:36.170
With that. we're done here.

71
00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:38.672
There are handouts with the curriculum
and such in the classroom

72
00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:40.465
so when you get back. look over them.

73
00:05:43.135 --> 00:05:44.052
Midoriya…

74
00:05:44.845 --> 00:05:47.639
Have the old lady
fix you in the nurse's office.

75
00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:50.851
Tomorrow will be packed
with even more rigorous tests.

76
00:05:51.018 --> 00:05:52.019
Prepare yourself.

77
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.982
<i>I got through this for now.</i>

78
00:05:57.733 --> 00:05:59.902
<i>but there was too much</i>
<i>that I couldn't do.</i>

79
00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:01.069
20 IZUKU MIDORIYA

80
00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:03.238
<i>I'm starting from last place.</i>

81
00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:07.659
<i>I have a lot to learn from here on out</i>

82
00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:10.662
<i>in order to get closer</i>
<i>to what I dream of becoming!</i>

83
00:06:10.996 --> 00:06:12.664
Aizawa. you liar!

84
00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:17.461
All Might. So you were watching?

85
00:06:17.628 --> 00:06:18.962
Too much time on your hands?

86
00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:20.797
"A rational deception" you said?

87
00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:23.550
April Fool's was last week.

88
00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:24.635
TEACHER DIRECTORY

89
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:27.721
<i>You punished a whole class</i>
<i>of last year's first-years</i>

90
00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:29.181
<i>with expulsion.</i>

91
00:06:30.224 --> 00:06:33.977
You cut those you judge to be
without potential without hesitation.

92
00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:36.063
For a man like that
to take back his words…

93
00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:38.148
That must be

94
00:06:38.941 --> 00:06:42.528
<i>because you also felt</i>
<i>the potential of that kid. right?</i>

95
00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:44.947
"Also"?

96
00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:48.033
You seem to be supporting him
quite a bit.

97
00:06:48.492 --> 00:06:51.203
Is that how a teacher should be acting?

98
00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:55.707
His potential was not zero.

99
00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:57.167
That's all it was.

100
00:06:57.543 --> 00:06:59.920
I will always cut those without potential.

101
00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:05.425
There's nothing crueler
than letting a dream end midway.

102
00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:11.056
So you're being kind
in your own way. huh. Aizawa?

103
00:07:11.223 --> 00:07:16.061
But we don't really get along after all.

104
00:07:20.566 --> 00:07:22.025
I'm so tired…

105
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:25.571
Iida!

106
00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:27.614
Is your finger healed?

107
00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:30.284
Yeah. thanks to Recovery Girl.

108
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.703
NURSE'S OFFICE

109
00:07:34.538 --> 00:07:36.623
Wow. it's healed!

110
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.169
But I suddenly feel very tired…

111
00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:44.715
My Quirk can only stimulate
a person's healing ability.

112
00:07:44.882 --> 00:07:47.009
Healing requires stamina.

113
00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:50.721
If you keep getting major injuries.
you'll use too much stamina

114
00:07:50.888 --> 00:07:52.723
and end up dying instead. so be careful.

115
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:54.141
I'll end up dying instead?

116
00:07:55.267 --> 00:07:57.394
<i>I can't just keep getting help</i>
<i>from others.</i>

117
00:07:57.769 --> 00:08:00.355
<i>I have to hurry up</i>
<i>and learn to control my power.</i>

118
00:08:00.856 --> 00:08:03.609
I was really taken in by Mr. Aizawa.

119
00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:07.279
I even thought.
"This is the best of the best" and such.

120
00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:10.032
I didn't think a teacher
would encourage us with a lie.

121
00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:14.411
<i>I thought Iida was scary.</i>
<i>but he's just earnest.</i>

122
00:08:14.578 --> 00:08:17.623
Hey! You two!

123
00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:18.832
Going to the station?

124
00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:20.459
Wait for me!

125
00:08:20.626 --> 00:08:21.502
Uraraka?

126
00:08:22.044 --> 00:08:23.462
You're the infinity girl.

127
00:08:24.213 --> 00:08:25.881
I'm Ochaco Uraraka.

128
00:08:26.048 --> 00:08:28.300
Um. you're Tenya Iida.

129
00:08:28.467 --> 00:08:30.802
and you're Deku Midoriya. right?

130
00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:31.845
"Deku"?

131
00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:36.058
Huh? But during the fitness test.
the boy named Bakugo said…

132
00:08:36.767 --> 00:08:37.768
Deku. you bastard!

133
00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:38.809
<i>Right?</i>

134
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:41.563
Uh… my real name is Izuku.

135
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.982
but Deku is what Kacchan calls me
to make fun of me…

136
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:45.025
An insult?

137
00:08:45.192 --> 00:08:47.569
Oh. is that right? Sorry!

138
00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:51.657
But "Deku" sounds like the Japanese word
for "You can do it!"

139
00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:53.158
so I kinda like it.

140
00:08:53.659 --> 00:08:55.494
-I'm Deku!
-Midoriya?

141
00:08:55.911 --> 00:08:58.247
You're accepting it too easily!
Wasn't that an insult?

142
00:08:58.914 --> 00:09:01.124
It's like a Copernican Revolution…

143
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:02.626
"Co-pe"?

144
00:09:03.669 --> 00:09:05.587
<i>There are so many things I can't do.</i>

145
00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:07.422
<i>I have to work hard and do my best.</i>

146
00:09:08.841 --> 00:09:10.551
<i>But. All Might.</i>

147
00:09:10.968 --> 00:09:14.805
<i>I can at least be happy</i>
<i>that I have friends. right?</i>

148
00:09:19.685 --> 00:09:23.063
<i>You don't have time to relax.</i>
<i>young man.</i>

149
00:09:23.814 --> 00:09:26.191
<i>The real thing starts tomorrow.</i>

150
00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:32.239
<i>The curriculum</i>
<i>of U.A. High's hero course:</i>

151
00:09:32.865 --> 00:09:36.618
<i>Regular required classes.</i>
<i>like English. in the morning.</i>

152
00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:39.955
Which of these English sentences is wrong?

153
00:09:41.123 --> 00:09:42.374
<i>So normal…</i>

154
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:43.834
<i>So damn boring.</i>

155
00:09:44.001 --> 00:09:47.045
Everybody. heads up!
Let's get this party started!

156
00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:49.131
<i>The relative pronoun is in</i>
<i>the wrong place in number four!</i>

157
00:09:49.298 --> 00:09:50.507
Okay. Yaoyorozu. come on!

158
00:09:51.175 --> 00:09:52.718
<i>Lunch is at the main cafeteria.</i>

159
00:09:52.885 --> 00:09:55.387
<i>where we can buy gourmet food</i>
<i>for reasonable prices.</i>

160
00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:58.182
White rice
is great comfort food. isn't it?

161
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:01.185
Yeah.

162
00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:05.397
<i>And then. in the afternoon.</i>
<i>we finally have…</i>

163
00:10:06.398 --> 00:10:08.150
<i>Hero Basic Training.</i>

164
00:10:09.318 --> 00:10:12.112
I am…

165
00:10:13.864 --> 00:10:16.241
coming through the door
like a normal person.

166
00:10:17.993 --> 00:10:18.994
It's All Might!

167
00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:22.789
Wow. he really is a teacher!

168
00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:25.417
That's a costume
from the Silver Age. isn't it?

169
00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:29.755
Its style is so different.
it's giving me goose bumps.

170
00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:32.966
I teach Hero Basic Training.

171
00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:34.510
It is a subject where you train

172
00:10:34.676 --> 00:10:37.304
in different ways
to learn the basics of being a hero.

173
00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:39.932
You'll take the most units
of this subject!

174
00:10:40.599 --> 00:10:41.892
Let's get right into it!

175
00:10:42.059 --> 00:10:44.603
This is what we'll do today…
Combat training!

176
00:10:45.604 --> 00:10:46.647
Combat…

177
00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:47.731
…training.

178
00:10:48.315 --> 00:10:51.151
And to go with that are these!

179
00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:55.405
Costumes made
based on your Quirk registrations

180
00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:57.824
and requests you sent in
before school started.

181
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:01.703
Costumes!

182
00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:05.541
<i>After you change. gather in Ground Beta!</i>

183
00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:07.125
<i>Yes. sir!</i>

184
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:19.054
They say the clothes make the man.
young men and ladies.

185
00:11:21.515 --> 00:11:22.683
Be fully aware…

186
00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:24.685
From now on…

187
00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:28.564
You are heroes!

188
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:37.573
That's great. everyone. You all look cool!

189
00:11:38.657 --> 00:11:41.952
Now. shall we begin. you zygotes?

190
00:11:51.962 --> 00:11:53.547
<i>The clothing allowance.</i>

191
00:11:53.714 --> 00:11:56.091
<i>Before we enrolled in U.A. High.</i>
<i>we submitted our Quirk registration.</i>

192
00:11:56.675 --> 00:12:00.345
<i>physical measurements.</i>
<i>and desired designs</i>

193
00:12:00.512 --> 00:12:02.639
<i>so a support company</i>
<i>under exclusive contract with the school</i>

194
00:12:02.806 --> 00:12:05.058
<i>could prepare</i>
<i>state-of-the-art costumes for us.</i>

195
00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:06.894
<i>It's a wonderful system.</i>

196
00:12:07.561 --> 00:12:09.062
THREE WEEKS AGO

197
00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:13.275
I need to go to city hall to get my Quirk
registration for the clothing allowance.

198
00:12:14.318 --> 00:12:16.445
But I'm already registered as "none"…

199
00:12:16.612 --> 00:12:18.530
Oh. what should I do?

200
00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:20.157
Quirk registration?

201
00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:22.534
Oh. you can update that.

202
00:12:22.701 --> 00:12:24.119
Really?

203
00:12:25.537 --> 00:12:27.122
<i>Everyone is examined</i>
<i>and registered all at once</i>

204
00:12:27.289 --> 00:12:28.916
<i>when they enter elementary school</i>
<i>and junior high. right?</i>

205
00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:31.835
<i>But there are cases</i>
<i>where people discover</i>

206
00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:34.379
<i>their Quirks aren't</i>
<i>what they thought they were.</i>

207
00:12:34.546 --> 00:12:35.589
SENDS OUT THE WATER
FROM HER BODY

208
00:12:35.756 --> 00:12:39.009
<i>So you're allowed to update it</i>
<i>once or twice.</i>

209
00:12:39.176 --> 00:12:40.219
TURNS MOISTURE IN THE AIR
INTO WATER

210
00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:43.013
<i>They won't accept outrageous changes.</i>

211
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.516
<i>but if you had "none" before.</i>
<i>it's probably fine.</i>

212
00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:47.601
-I'm home!
-<i>And by "probably." I mean I'm sure…</i>

213
00:12:47.768 --> 00:12:49.353
Oh. I hung up by accident!

214
00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.355
<i>I'll have to apologize later.</i>

215
00:12:51.855 --> 00:12:53.065
Welcome back!

216
00:12:53.232 --> 00:12:54.733
Hey. Izuku.

217
00:12:55.609 --> 00:12:57.069
Congrats on getting into U.A.!

218
00:12:57.236 --> 00:12:58.904
I might've jumped to conclusions. though.

219
00:12:59.071 --> 00:13:00.322
A jumpsuit?

220
00:13:00.489 --> 00:13:03.200
It's not much as it is now. though.

221
00:13:03.909 --> 00:13:06.203
<i>When you'd dozed off while studying.</i>

222
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:08.580
<i>I happened to see your notebook.</i>

223
00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:09.665
What?

224
00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:10.958
COOL LIKE ALL MIGHT

225
00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:17.089
The terrible thing I said
kept bothering me.

226
00:13:18.173 --> 00:13:20.342
<i>I gave up back then.</i>

227
00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:24.012
But you didn't give up.

228
00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:27.057
You kept chasing your dream.
didn't you?

229
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.269
I'm sorry. Izuku.

230
00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:33.730
I'll support you openly
with everything I've got from now on!

231
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:39.695
<i>These are my mother's feelings.</i>

232
00:13:40.571 --> 00:13:42.447
<i>What'll I wear if not this!</i>

233
00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:47.911
<i>Even if it's not the most convenient</i>
<i>or state-of-the-art. it's fine.</i>

234
00:13:50.581 --> 00:13:53.083
<i>This is my costume!</i>

235
00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:55.377
Oh. Deku?

236
00:13:55.752 --> 00:13:58.088
-Uraraka!
-That looks cool!

237
00:13:58.255 --> 00:14:00.424
Really down to earth.

238
00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:03.260
I should've written what I wanted…

239
00:14:03.427 --> 00:14:05.429
Mine ended up being
a skintight bodysuit.

240
00:14:05.596 --> 00:14:06.597
It's embarrassing…

241
00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:09.725
The hero course is the best.

242
00:14:17.858 --> 00:14:19.359
<i>So obvious…</i>

243
00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:22.613
Now. it's time for combat training!

244
00:14:22.988 --> 00:14:23.989
Sir!

245
00:14:24.156 --> 00:14:25.365
<i>Oh. that was Iida.</i>

246
00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:26.992
<i>He looks cool.</i>

247
00:14:27.159 --> 00:14:29.203
This is a battle center
from the entrance exam.

248
00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:31.622
so will we be conducting
urban battles again?

249
00:14:31.955 --> 00:14:34.499
No. we're going to move ahead
two steps!

250
00:14:35.751 --> 00:14:37.961
<i>Most of the time.</i>
<i>fighting villains takes place outside.</i>

251
00:14:38.921 --> 00:14:41.173
<i>but if you look at the total numbers.</i>

252
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.091
<i>atrocious villains</i>
<i>appear indoors at a higher rate.</i>

253
00:14:44.593 --> 00:14:47.179
Imprisonment. house arrest.
backroom deals…

254
00:14:47.346 --> 00:14:50.349
In this society filled with heroes.

255
00:14:51.141 --> 00:14:53.644
truly intelligent villains
hide in the shadows!

256
00:14:54.478 --> 00:14:57.731
For this class.
you'll be split into villains and heroes

257
00:14:57.898 --> 00:14:59.900
and fight two-on-two indoor battles.

258
00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:02.444
Without basic training?

259
00:15:02.903 --> 00:15:05.155
This is a real battle
to understand those basics!

260
00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:10.410
<i>However. the key this time is that</i>
<i>there's no robot you can just beat up.</i>

261
00:15:10.744 --> 00:15:12.287
How will wins and losses
be determined?

262
00:15:12.663 --> 00:15:13.789
Can we beat them up anyway?

263
00:15:13.956 --> 00:15:16.625
Will the punishment be expulsion
like with Mr. Aizawa?

264
00:15:16.792 --> 00:15:19.378
How shall we be split up?

265
00:15:19.545 --> 00:15:20.838
Isn't this cape crazy?

266
00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:24.091
I'll answer all your questions!

267
00:15:25.175 --> 00:15:27.094
-Now listen here.
-A script?

268
00:15:27.469 --> 00:15:29.680
<i>The situation</i>
<i>is that the villains have hidden</i>

269
00:15:29.847 --> 00:15:31.723
<i>a nuclear weapon</i>
<i>somewhere in their hideout.</i>

270
00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.059
<i>The heroes</i>
<i>are trying to dispose of that.</i>

271
00:15:34.226 --> 00:15:36.228
<i>The heroes need to catch the villains</i>

272
00:15:36.395 --> 00:15:38.605
<i>or get the nuclear weapon back</i>
<i>in the allotted time.</i>

273
00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:41.024
<i>The villains need to protect</i>
<i>the nuclear weapon</i>

274
00:15:41.191 --> 00:15:43.443
<i>for the whole time</i>
<i>or catch the heroes.</i>

275
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:46.238
<i>The situation</i>
<i>feels very American!</i>

276
00:15:46.947 --> 00:15:49.157
Teams and opponents
will be determined by drawing lots!

277
00:15:49.825 --> 00:15:51.243
They're being decided so haphazardly?

278
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:55.539
Pros often have to create makeshift
teams with heroes from other agencies.

279
00:15:55.706 --> 00:15:57.457
so maybe that's why?

280
00:15:57.624 --> 00:16:00.627
I see.
The discernment to look ahead…

281
00:16:01.128 --> 00:16:02.254
Please excuse my rudeness!

282
00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:04.339
It's fine. Let's do this quickly!

283
00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:05.966
TEAM A

284
00:16:06.133 --> 00:16:07.593
TEAM B

285
00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:09.219
TEAM C

286
00:16:09.386 --> 00:16:10.846
TEAM D

287
00:16:11.013 --> 00:16:12.472
TEAM E

288
00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:14.099
TEAM F

289
00:16:14.266 --> 00:16:15.726
TEAM G

290
00:16:15.893 --> 00:16:17.352
TEAM H

291
00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:18.896
TEAM I

292
00:16:19.062 --> 00:16:20.606
TEAM J

293
00:16:21.064 --> 00:16:23.609
Wow. it must be fate!
I'm counting on you!

294
00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:26.403
<i>Seriously?</i>
<i>I have to speak properly. or else…</i>

295
00:16:26.945 --> 00:16:29.156
The first teams to fight
will be…

296
00:16:30.699 --> 00:16:31.658
these guys!

297
00:16:32.993 --> 00:16:36.205
<i>Team A will be the heroes.</i>
<i>and Team D will be the villains.</i>

298
00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.499
Everyone else.
head toward the monitor room.

299
00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:40.667
Yes. sir!

300
00:17:01.522 --> 00:17:03.899
Villain team. go in first and set up!

301
00:17:04.066 --> 00:17:07.236
In five minutes. the hero team
will break in. and the battle will start!

302
00:17:07.402 --> 00:17:08.319
Yes. sir!

303
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.074
Young Iida. young Bakugo.

304
00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:14.867
learn to think
from the perspective of the villains.

305
00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:16.537
This is pretty close to a real battle.

306
00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:18.497
Go all out.
Don't be afraid to get hurt.

307
00:17:18.664 --> 00:17:19.665
Yes. sir!

308
00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.500
If things go too far. I will stop it.

309
00:17:21.834 --> 00:17:22.792
Yes. sir!

310
00:17:26.046 --> 00:17:30.259
Even if this is training.
it pains me to become a villain.

311
00:17:31.677 --> 00:17:33.595
So our job is to protect this?

312
00:17:34.638 --> 00:17:35.806
It's <i>papier-mâché</i>.

313
00:17:35.973 --> 00:17:37.015
Hey!

314
00:17:38.225 --> 00:17:40.519
Deku has a Quirk. right?

315
00:17:41.687 --> 00:17:43.689
You saw that extraordinary
strength. didn't you?

316
00:17:43.856 --> 00:17:45.691
It appears to carry a lot of risk. though…

317
00:17:46.942 --> 00:17:50.362
However. you seem to be especially
angry when it comes to Midoriya…

318
00:17:51.655 --> 00:17:54.658
<i>Did he dare trick me?</i>

319
00:17:55.659 --> 00:17:58.078
<i>That damn nerd!</i>

320
00:18:00.205 --> 00:18:03.792
It's a lot of work to memorize
the building's floor plan.

321
00:18:04.459 --> 00:18:08.172
But All Might is just the same
as when he's on TV.

322
00:18:08.338 --> 00:18:11.425
Unlike Mr. Aizawa.
it looks like there's no punishment.

323
00:18:11.592 --> 00:18:14.761
so we can relax and…
You're not relaxed at all!

324
00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:18.473
Well. it's because…
we're up against Kacchan…

325
00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.561
And there's Iida. too.
so I feel like I need to be on guard…

326
00:18:22.728 --> 00:18:23.854
I see.

327
00:18:24.021 --> 00:18:26.815
Bakugo's the one
who makes fun of you. right?

328
00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:30.068
He's amazing.

329
00:18:30.777 --> 00:18:35.574
I'll definitely surpass All Might
and become the top hero!

330
00:18:37.201 --> 00:18:38.952
He's a piece of work.

331
00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:44.374
but his goal. his confidence.
his physical strength. and his Quirk

332
00:18:44.541 --> 00:18:47.503
are way more amazing than mine.

333
00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:52.132
But that's why right now…

334
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.012
I don't want to lose.

335
00:19:00.557 --> 00:19:02.351
A fated battle between men. huh?

336
00:19:02.518 --> 00:19:05.270
Oh. sorry.
this isn't your problem. Uraraka.

337
00:19:05.437 --> 00:19:07.189
It is! We're a team. aren't we?

338
00:19:07.356 --> 00:19:08.732
Let's do our best!

339
00:19:11.652 --> 00:19:14.530
<i>Now. let's start</i>
<i>the indoor person-to-person</i>

340
00:19:15.489 --> 00:19:18.659
<i>combat training</i>
<i>with Team A and Team D!</i>

341
00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:23.163
Okay. everyone.
you all should think as well.

342
00:19:24.581 --> 00:19:28.043
<i>Young Midoriya! Here. you are</i>
<i>no more than a single student.</i>

343
00:19:29.169 --> 00:19:32.464
<i>I'll grade you strictly.</i>
<i>without playing favorites.</i>

344
00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:36.969
We've infiltrated successfully!

345
00:19:37.135 --> 00:19:39.137
There are a lot of blind spots.
so let's be careful.

346
00:19:55.112 --> 00:19:57.865
<i>I still can't control One For All.</i>

347
00:19:58.031 --> 00:20:00.242
<i>so I can't use it against anyone.</i>

348
00:20:00.409 --> 00:20:03.412
<i>If I use that on someone. it'll kill them.</i>

349
00:20:04.288 --> 00:20:06.915
<i>We just have to do it</i>
<i>with the power I have now</i>

350
00:20:07.082 --> 00:20:08.709
<i>and Uraraka's Zero Gravity.</i>

351
00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.420
<i>I've got to use my head…</i>

352
00:20:12.004 --> 00:20:15.549
<i>Those notes on indoor battles…</i>
<i>battles in tight spaces…</i>

353
00:20:15.716 --> 00:20:17.050
HERO ANALYSIS FOR THE FUTURE

354
00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:18.510
<i>Remember!</i>

355
00:20:25.893 --> 00:20:27.186
Uraraka. are you all right?

356
00:20:27.352 --> 00:20:28.520
Yeah. thanks.

357
00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:31.607
-Deku?
-It's just a scratch.

358
00:20:34.443 --> 00:20:37.738
Come Deku. don't dodge.

359
00:20:38.322 --> 00:20:42.159
I figured you'd come for me first.

360
00:20:42.701 --> 00:20:43.702
A surprise attack from the start?

361
00:20:44.244 --> 00:20:45.621
Bakugo. that's cheating!

362
00:20:45.787 --> 00:20:47.372
A surprise attack isn't manly at all!

363
00:20:47.539 --> 00:20:49.082
A surprise attack is a strategy. too.

364
00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:51.627
They're in the middle
of a real battle right now.

365
00:20:51.793 --> 00:20:53.837
Midori avoided it!

366
00:20:54.004 --> 00:20:55.255
There goes Bakugo!

367
00:20:55.756 --> 00:20:59.384
I won't do so much damage that this fight
gets stopped. but I'm gonna get close!

368
00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:04.306
Wow. he's like a martial arts master!

369
00:21:05.599 --> 00:21:06.892
<i>What's with this guy?</i>

370
00:21:07.684 --> 00:21:10.145
<i>Did he read my moves?</i>

371
00:21:23.075 --> 00:21:24.743
Kacchan…

372
00:21:25.536 --> 00:21:28.747
You usually start with a big right swing.

373
00:21:28.914 --> 00:21:31.750
How much do you think
I've been watching you?

374
00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:38.966
I wrote an analysis for all the heroes
I thought were amazing in my notebook.

375
00:21:40.676 --> 00:21:43.554
<i>In the notebook</i>
<i>you blew up and threw away.</i>

376
00:21:47.641 --> 00:21:51.562
My "Deku" isn't always
going to mean "useless"!

377
00:21:52.896 --> 00:21:54.356
Kacchan.

378
00:21:54.523 --> 00:21:58.694
my "Deku" means "You can do it!"

379
00:21:59.945 --> 00:22:01.280
<i>But "Deku" sounds like</i>

380
00:22:01.446 --> 00:22:03.323
the Japanese word
for "You can do it!"

381
00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.117
so I kinda like it.

382
00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:10.998
Deku…

383
00:22:12.791 --> 00:22:15.836
If you keep going. I'll never forgive you!

384
00:22:19.131 --> 00:22:21.175
Even though you're scared…

385
00:22:24.386 --> 00:22:29.099
That's what I hate about you!

386
00:24:01.108 --> 00:24:02.943
NEXT TIME

387
00:24:04.278 --> 00:24:06.905
<i>Midoriya. even if this is combat training.</i>

388
00:24:07.322 --> 00:24:08.991
<i>I will give it my all.</i>

389
00:24:09.157 --> 00:24:12.578
<i>so as not to embarrass</i>
<i>the name of the hero family. Iida!</i>

390
00:24:12.744 --> 00:24:15.205
<i>Iida. you're going to play a villain. huh?</i>

391
00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:19.835
<i>I am extremely evil. you know.</i>

392
00:24:20.335 --> 00:24:21.795
<i>He's completely in character!</i>

393
00:24:21.962 --> 00:24:24.381
<i>Next time. "Deku vs. Kacchan"!</i>

394
00:24:24.548 --> 00:24:26.967
<i>I didn't know Uraraka</i>
<i>was a baseball player!</i>

395
00:24:27.134 --> 00:24:28.343
<i>Go beyond!</i>

396
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:29.720
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>

397
00:24:29.887 --> 00:24:30.971
DEKU VS. KACCHAN
