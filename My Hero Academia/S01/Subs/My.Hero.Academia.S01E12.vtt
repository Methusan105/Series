1
00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.507
<i>He got me…</i>

2
00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:07.633
Teacher!

3
00:00:11.762 --> 00:00:13.597
<i>I'm sure I erased his Quirk.</i>

4
00:00:13.764 --> 00:00:17.142
<i>That means he is just that strong.</i>

5
00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.146
<i>He's as strong as All Might…</i>

6
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.071
Let go of her!

7
00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:30.697
Smash!

8
00:00:35.953 --> 00:00:36.912
Ribbit!

9
00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:41.416
<i>We were all. even the teachers.</i>

10
00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.669
<i>covered by the darkness</i>
<i>of evil and fear…</i>

11
00:00:52.928 --> 00:00:54.847
<i>The deeper the darkness…</i>

12
00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.188
<i>the more dazzling the light shines.</i>

13
00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:05.107
All Might!

14
00:02:40.744 --> 00:02:42.788
<i>I had a bad feeling.</i>

15
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.625
<i>so I tore myself away from my chat</i>
<i>with the principal and came.</i>

16
00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:50.796
<i>I passed young Iida on my way</i>

17
00:02:50.963 --> 00:02:53.549
<i>and got a rough idea</i>
<i>of what had happened.</i>

18
00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:58.554
<i>Good grief. it really makes me angry.</i>

19
00:03:00.097 --> 00:03:03.100
<i>Thinking about how frightening</i>
<i>it must have been for the children…</i>

20
00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:06.854
<i>And how hard my juniors fought…</i>

21
00:03:08.564 --> 00:03:14.111
<i>But that is why I must proudly say…</i>

22
00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:17.865
It's fine now!

23
00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:23.120
I am here!

24
00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:25.205
All Might!

25
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:27.499
Ribbit…

26
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.045
All… Might…

27
00:03:34.131 --> 00:03:35.799
He's not smiling…

28
00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.387
I've been waiting. hero.

29
00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:43.891
You trash of society.

30
00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:47.895
EPISODE 12: ALL MIGHT

31
00:03:49.897 --> 00:03:51.607
That's All Might?

32
00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.401
It's my first time
seeing him in person!

33
00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:56.320
He looks so intimidating…

34
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.655
Idiots. don't hesitate!

35
00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:00.616
If we kill that. we'll…

36
00:04:13.462 --> 00:04:15.839
Sorry. Aizawa.

37
00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:28.519
Huh?

38
00:04:29.478 --> 00:04:30.395
What?

39
00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:32.147
Everyone. go to the entrance.

40
00:04:32.314 --> 00:04:33.815
I'm leaving Aizawa to you.

41
00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:35.275
He's unconscious. Hurry!

42
00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:37.569
-Yes. sir!
-Ribbit.

43
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.280
All Might…

44
00:04:43.367 --> 00:04:48.038
It's no good…

45
00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:51.542
I'm sorry. Father…

46
00:04:57.089 --> 00:05:00.676
He hit me as he was saving them.

47
00:05:00.843 --> 00:05:03.136
It's the violence
of a government official.

48
00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:07.099
He's fast. as expected.
I can't follow him with my eyes.

49
00:05:07.516 --> 00:05:10.185
But not as fast as I thought he'd be.

50
00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:13.105
I guess it's true. after all…

51
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.900
that he's getting weaker.

52
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.031
All Might. you can't.

53
00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:25.450
That brain villain took One Fo…

54
00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:28.787
He took a punch that didn't break my arm.
but he didn't even twitch.

55
00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:30.372
He's gotta be…

56
00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.291
Young Midoriya!

57
00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:35.169
It's fine!

58
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.018
Carolina…

59
00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:52.311
Nomu.

60
00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:53.812
Smash!

61
00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:04.990
It seriously has no effect at all. huh?

62
00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:09.286
In that case…

63
00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:18.086
It doesn't work on his face. either. huh?

64
00:06:19.922 --> 00:06:22.758
It doesn't work
because of shock absorption.

65
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.137
In order to cause damage to Nomu.

66
00:06:27.304 --> 00:06:31.767
it would be most effective
to slowly gouge out his flesh.

67
00:06:31.934 --> 00:06:34.686
Whether he'd let you do that
or not is a different issue. though.

68
00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:37.439
Thanks for telling me all that!

69
00:06:38.357 --> 00:06:41.026
If that's true. then it's easier for me.

70
00:06:44.363 --> 00:06:45.948
Hey. hey.

71
00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:49.368
All right! Take that!

72
00:06:49.535 --> 00:06:50.452
Wow…

73
00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:53.205
Those guys are underestimating
All Might too much!

74
00:06:55.541 --> 00:06:59.086
How did he make a suplex
look like an explosion?

75
00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:01.672
All Might's on a whole other level!

76
00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:05.843
Even though he's a rookie teacher who
can't teach without looking at his notes.

77
00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:08.470
<i>It's possible they have a way to kill him…</i>

78
00:07:08.637 --> 00:07:12.683
<i>Even so.</i>
<i>there's nothing we can do right now.</i>

79
00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:17.980
<i>Instead. if anyone gets held hostage.</i>
<i>we'd be worse than in the way.</i>

80
00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:19.857
<i>Rather than wondering</i>
<i>about the villains.</i>

81
00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:21.733
<i>we have to trust All Might!</i>

82
00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:24.987
Get 'em! Aim for the balls!

83
00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:27.948
Were we overthinking it?

84
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.242
He's amazing.

85
00:07:31.702 --> 00:07:32.953
<i>But…</i>

86
00:07:33.412 --> 00:07:35.455
<i>But I know…</i>

87
00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:41.336
<i>Every day on my way to school.</i>
<i>I read the hero news in real time.</i>

88
00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:45.090
<i>When they were talking about</i>
<i>how All Might wasn't at USJ.</i>

89
00:07:45.841 --> 00:07:49.720
<i>the three fingers Thirteen</i>
<i>put up secretly were probably…</i>

90
00:07:51.138 --> 00:07:53.432
<i>because All Might was at his limit.</i>

91
00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:56.059
<i>It must've been because he'd used</i>
<i>too much of his power!</i>

92
00:07:58.061 --> 00:08:00.606
<i>I'm the only one who knows…</i>

93
00:08:01.607 --> 00:08:04.985
It's an injury I got
from an enemy's attack five years ago.

94
00:08:05.903 --> 00:08:07.779
Half of my respiratory organs
were destroyed.

95
00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:09.740
and I lost my whole stomach.

96
00:08:09.907 --> 00:08:13.952
I've become emaciated from
repeated surgeries and the aftereffects.

97
00:08:14.745 --> 00:08:20.792
Right now. I can only work as a hero
for about three hours a day.

98
00:08:22.461 --> 00:08:24.379
<i>I will save people with a smile!</i>

99
00:08:25.214 --> 00:08:29.218
The Symbol of Peace
cannot be daunted by evil.

100
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.847
I smile to show the pressure of heroes

101
00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:38.393
<i>and to trick the fear inside of me.</i>

102
00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:44.566
<i>I'm the only one who knows…</i>

103
00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:47.569
<i>All Might's secret</i>

104
00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:49.988
<i>and the predicament he's in.</i>

105
00:08:52.908 --> 00:08:53.825
Is…

106
00:08:54.243 --> 00:08:56.578
Is that how it is?

107
00:09:00.249 --> 00:09:04.711
Were you trying to keep him from moving
by sticking him deep in the concrete?

108
00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:06.922
You won't be able to stop him like that.

109
00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:11.510
Because Nomu is as strong as you are.

110
00:09:15.264 --> 00:09:17.015
This is good. Kurogiri.

111
00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:20.269
It's an unexpected opportunity.

112
00:09:25.691 --> 00:09:28.527
<i>Ouch! That's my weak spot!</i>

113
00:09:28.694 --> 00:09:29.611
<i>Stop it!</i>

114
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.492
<i>What power!</i>

115
00:09:36.827 --> 00:09:39.454
This is your first offense?

116
00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:42.207
You'd better prepare yourselves…

117
00:09:45.586 --> 00:09:47.087
Kurogiri.

118
00:09:47.254 --> 00:09:52.092
I do not want blood and guts
overflowing within me.

119
00:09:52.259 --> 00:09:55.512
but I would be happy
to take in someone as great as you.

120
00:09:57.181 --> 00:09:59.433
You are too fast to see
with the human eye.

121
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.977
Restraining you was Nomu's job.

122
00:10:02.144 --> 00:10:07.858
And then. when your body
is halfway in. to close the gate…

123
00:10:10.903 --> 00:10:13.655
and tear you apart is my job.

124
00:10:15.991 --> 00:10:17.034
Asui.

125
00:10:17.201 --> 00:10:18.744
What is it. Midoriya?

126
00:10:18.911 --> 00:10:21.038
Trade places with me
carrying Mr. Aizawa.

127
00:10:21.205 --> 00:10:24.041
Ribbit? Okay… But why?

128
00:10:26.043 --> 00:10:27.002
<i>No…</i>

129
00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:30.005
<i>No. All Might!</i>

130
00:10:31.423 --> 00:10:33.133
Midoriya!

131
00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:38.972
<i>There are still tons of things</i>
<i>I want you to teach me!</i>

132
00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:42.684
All Might!

133
00:10:43.769 --> 00:10:44.770
<i>Young Midoriya?</i>

134
00:10:45.604 --> 00:10:47.356
<i>What are you…</i>

135
00:10:50.359 --> 00:10:51.735
How foolish.

136
00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:01.119
Move! You're in the way. Deku!

137
00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:04.039
Take that!

138
00:11:09.962 --> 00:11:10.963
<i>He's frozen?</i>

139
00:11:12.214 --> 00:11:13.966
<i>Young Todoroki?</i>

140
00:11:14.758 --> 00:11:18.971
All I heard was that you all are here
to kill All Might.

141
00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:24.852
<i>He controlled it so that the ice stopped</i>
<i>just before it reached me.</i>

142
00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:27.771
<i>Thanks to that. his grip loosened!</i>

143
00:11:32.484 --> 00:11:33.485
All Might!

144
00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:39.825
Huh?
Damn it! I didn't get to show off!

145
00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:43.078
Stop acting so stuck-up.
foggy nobody!

146
00:11:43.704 --> 00:11:46.999
The Symbol of Peace
cannot be killed by the likes of you.

147
00:11:48.959 --> 00:11:51.295
Kacchan! Everyone!

148
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.782
Todoroki… Bakugo…

149
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:22.826
And Kirishima.

150
00:12:24.912 --> 00:12:26.622
Leave this to them. Let's hurry!

151
00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:28.165
Right.

152
00:12:30.209 --> 00:12:31.835
Everyone…

153
00:12:34.046 --> 00:12:35.923
Wait. isn't that Tsu?

154
00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:38.509
Hey!

155
00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:40.010
Ochaco?

156
00:12:40.177 --> 00:12:42.804
Hey. help us out!

157
00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:45.098
He's heavy!

158
00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:46.475
Mr. Aizawa?

159
00:12:46.642 --> 00:12:47.768
Let's go!

160
00:12:50.187 --> 00:12:53.774
<i>Leave this to All Might…</i>

161
00:12:53.941 --> 00:12:57.694
<i>When the other teachers get here.</i>
<i>get to a safe place…</i>

162
00:12:58.570 --> 00:12:59.530
Okay!

163
00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:10.666
Kurogiri. our exit and entrance.
has been overcome.

164
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.169
We're in a pinch.

165
00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:18.715
You careless bastard.
You're just what I thought you'd be.

166
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.845
<i>Only certain parts of you</i>
<i>can turn into a misty warp gate.</i>

167
00:13:23.637 --> 00:13:28.100
<i>The fog gate</i>
<i>covered your actual body. right?</i>

168
00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:30.227
Back then…

169
00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:37.442
Oh dear. that was close.

170
00:13:38.068 --> 00:13:40.863
If you were completely made of mist
and physical attacks couldn't touch you.

171
00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:44.366
then you wouldn't have said
"that was close."

172
00:13:47.244 --> 00:13:48.912
Don't move!

173
00:13:49.663 --> 00:13:52.291
If I feel like you're moving suspiciously.

174
00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:53.917
then I'll blow you up.

175
00:13:54.543 --> 00:13:56.879
His behavior isn't very hero-like…

176
00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:02.676
In addition to capturing them.
they're almost all uninjured.

177
00:14:02.843 --> 00:14:05.637
Kids these days are amazing.

178
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.975
They make the League of Villains
look bad.

179
00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:12.477
Nomu.

180
00:14:24.948 --> 00:14:27.576
Even though his body's broken…
He's still moving?

181
00:14:28.202 --> 00:14:30.204
Get back. everyone!

182
00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.499
What?

183
00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:36.710
His Quirk wasn't shock absorption?

184
00:14:37.252 --> 00:14:40.047
I didn't say that was all he had.

185
00:14:40.214 --> 00:14:41.965
This is his super-regeneration.

186
00:14:43.759 --> 00:14:48.222
Nomu has been modified
to take you at 100%.

187
00:14:48.972 --> 00:14:52.351
He's a super-efficient human sandbag.

188
00:14:56.438 --> 00:14:59.274
First. we need to get our gate back.

189
00:15:00.192 --> 00:15:01.151
Go. Nomu.

190
00:15:03.028 --> 00:15:04.530
<i>He's fast!</i>

191
00:15:18.544 --> 00:15:19.711
Ow…

192
00:15:24.675 --> 00:15:26.510
K-Kacchan!

193
00:15:27.928 --> 00:15:28.971
Kacchan?

194
00:15:29.555 --> 00:15:31.139
You dodged? That's amazing!

195
00:15:31.306 --> 00:15:33.141
No. shut up. scum!

196
00:15:35.185 --> 00:15:37.563
<i>I didn't… see anything…</i>

197
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:40.315
Then how…

198
00:15:41.984 --> 00:15:43.151
Then that was…

199
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:49.658
All Might!

200
00:15:50.826 --> 00:15:53.120
He protected the child. huh?

201
00:15:56.415 --> 00:15:58.458
Do you not know how to hold back?

202
00:15:59.501 --> 00:16:01.837
It was to rescue my companions.

203
00:16:02.004 --> 00:16:03.714
I had no choice.

204
00:16:03.881 --> 00:16:06.466
I mean. earlier. that…

205
00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:08.886
that plain-looking one.

206
00:16:09.052 --> 00:16:12.472
He was about to punch me
with everything he had. you know.

207
00:16:13.182 --> 00:16:16.852
Violence for the sake of others
makes it admirable.

208
00:16:17.019 --> 00:16:19.313
Isn't that right. hero?

209
00:16:20.898 --> 00:16:24.651
You know what. All Might? I'm angry.

210
00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:26.403
I'm angry at this world

211
00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:29.114
that categorizes the same violent acts
as heroic or villainous.

212
00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:33.118
deciding what's good and what's bad.

213
00:16:33.744 --> 00:16:36.455
"Symbol of Peace"? Ha.

214
00:16:36.622 --> 00:16:40.125
You're just a device to repress violence.

215
00:16:41.043 --> 00:16:43.921
Violence only breeds violence.

216
00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:47.132
The world will know this
once we kill you!

217
00:16:48.884 --> 00:16:50.761
That's preposterous.

218
00:16:50.928 --> 00:16:54.473
The eyes of white-collar criminals
like you burn silently.

219
00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.227
You just want to enjoy this yourself.
don't you. you liar?

220
00:17:00.771 --> 00:17:02.397
<i>He's already figured me out?</i>

221
00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:06.151
It's three against five.

222
00:17:06.734 --> 00:17:08.819
Kacchan already exposed
the fog's weakness!

223
00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:12.616
These guys are crazy.
but if we backup All Might.

224
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:14.492
we can push them back!

225
00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:15.911
No!

226
00:17:16.578 --> 00:17:17.704
Run away.

227
00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:22.751
You would've been in trouble
if I hadn't done anything earlier. right?

228
00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:27.047
That was a different story.
young Todoroki. Thanks.

229
00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:32.052
But it's fine! Just watch
as a pro gives it everything he's got.

230
00:17:32.928 --> 00:17:34.179
All Might. you're bleeding…

231
00:17:34.763 --> 00:17:36.640
Besides. time's…

232
00:17:41.645 --> 00:17:43.313
<i>All Might…</i>

233
00:17:47.943 --> 00:17:50.362
Nomu. Kurogiri. Get him.

234
00:17:51.363 --> 00:17:53.156
I'll deal with the children.

235
00:17:57.327 --> 00:18:00.831
<i>It's true that I barely have</i>
<i>a minute left.</i>

236
00:18:00.998 --> 00:18:04.168
<i>My power has been declining</i>
<i>faster than I expected.</i>

237
00:18:05.169 --> 00:18:07.337
Now. let's clear this and go home.

238
00:18:08.505 --> 00:18:11.341
<i>But I must do this.</i>

239
00:18:13.468 --> 00:18:15.012
Hey. we've gotta do this after all!

240
00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:18.015
<i>Why? Because I am…</i>

241
00:18:23.478 --> 00:18:26.523
<i>the Symbol of Peace!</i>

242
00:18:36.867 --> 00:18:37.743
Damn.

243
00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:42.039
Hey. you talked about his shock
absorption yourself earlier. didn't you?

244
00:18:42.206 --> 00:18:43.999
Yes. I did!

245
00:18:55.177 --> 00:18:57.262
A head-on fistfight?

246
00:18:58.138 --> 00:18:59.389
Wow…

247
00:19:00.599 --> 00:19:02.559
I can't get near them!

248
00:19:04.144 --> 00:19:08.273
If your Quirk isn't shock nullification
but shock absorption…

249
00:19:09.316 --> 00:19:12.194
then. there's a limit to it. right?

250
00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:19.826
Made to fight me?

251
00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:23.705
If you can withstand me at 100%.

252
00:19:25.249 --> 00:19:28.877
then I'll force you to surrender
from beyond that!

253
00:19:33.882 --> 00:19:37.010
<i>He's bleeding while giving it his all!</i>

254
00:19:39.304 --> 00:19:42.599
<i>He's not swinging randomly.</i>

255
00:19:42.766 --> 00:19:45.602
<i>Every single hit…</i>

256
00:19:48.981 --> 00:19:50.858
<i>is more than 100% of his power!</i>

257
00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.616
A hero…

258
00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:07.332
can always break out of a tough spot!

259
00:20:26.643 --> 00:20:32.191
Hey villain.
have you ever heard these words?

260
00:20:32.858 --> 00:20:34.902
Go beyond!

261
00:20:35.777 --> 00:20:37.446
Plus…

262
00:20:38.113 --> 00:20:41.033
Ultra!

263
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.294
What's this vibration?

264
00:20:54.546 --> 00:20:55.422
An explosion?

265
00:21:07.518 --> 00:21:10.395
That was a villain up there
just now. wasn't it?

266
00:21:11.438 --> 00:21:12.648
Yeah…

267
00:21:12.814 --> 00:21:13.941
This power is…

268
00:21:15.442 --> 00:21:17.069
It's All Might!

269
00:21:17.236 --> 00:21:20.197
There's no one else
who can do something so amazing!

270
00:21:20.364 --> 00:21:21.448
Ribbit. ribbit.

271
00:21:21.615 --> 00:21:22.950
Yay!

272
00:21:24.284 --> 00:21:25.994
Is this a comic book or something?

273
00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:28.956
It's like he nullified
the shock absorption.

274
00:21:29.373 --> 00:21:31.375
His brute strength is crazy.

275
00:21:31.542 --> 00:21:33.460
What insane power…

276
00:21:33.627 --> 00:21:36.839
Does this mean he rushed at him
so fast he couldn't regenerate?

277
00:21:38.298 --> 00:21:39.842
<i>So this is the top…</i>

278
00:21:40.551 --> 00:21:43.136
<i>Is this… the world of pros?</i>

279
00:21:47.474 --> 00:21:48.976
All Might…

280
00:21:50.978 --> 00:21:53.272
I really have gotten weaker…

281
00:21:53.438 --> 00:21:57.234
In my prime.
five hits would've been enough.

282
00:22:01.154 --> 00:22:05.200
But it took more than 300 hits.

283
00:22:09.955 --> 00:22:13.375
<i>And now… I'm out of time.</i>

284
00:22:16.712 --> 00:22:18.005
Now. villains…

285
00:22:21.466 --> 00:22:24.553
I'm sure we'd all like to end this
as soon as possible.

286
00:22:26.305 --> 00:22:28.223
Did he use a cheat?

287
00:24:01.066 --> 00:24:02.401
NEXT TIME

288
00:24:02.568 --> 00:24:03.944
<i>The members of this class</i>

289
00:24:04.111 --> 00:24:05.571
<i>will become strong heroes!</i>

290
00:24:05.737 --> 00:24:08.115
<i>Next time. "In Each of Our Hearts"!</i>

291
00:24:08.282 --> 00:24:10.576
<i>Now. yell out toward that sunset!</i>

292
00:24:10.993 --> 00:24:12.578
<i>Go beyond!</i>

293
00:24:12.744 --> 00:24:14.830
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>

294
00:24:14.997 --> 00:24:15.914
NEXT TIME: IN EACH OF OUR HEARTS
